"tt0453418","0","1","It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as ""Teachers""."
"tt0453418","0","2","My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than is ""Teachers""."
"tt0453418","0","3","The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students."
"tt0453418","0","4","When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High."
"tt0453418","0","5","A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to sack one of your teachers."
"tt0453418","0","6","STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High."
"tt0453418","0","7","I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched."
"tt0453418","0","8","What a pity that it isn't!"
"tt0453418","1","0","If you like adult comedy cartoons, like South Park, then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High."
"tt0453418","1","1","Keisha, Natella and Latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader."
"tt0453418","1","2","There are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school."
"tt0453418","1","3","There's the idiotic principal, Mr. Bip, the nervous Maths teacher and many others."
"tt0453418","1","4","The cast is also fantastic, Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers' Mark Perry and Blunder's Nina Conti."
"tt0453418","1","5","I didn't know this came from Canada, but it is very good."
"tt0453418","1","6","Very good!"
"tt0453418","2","0","Bromwell High is nothing short of brilliant."
"tt0453418","2","1","Expertly scripted and perfectly delivered, this searing parody of a students and teachers at a South London Public School leaves you literally rolling with laughter."
"tt0453418","2","2","It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp."
"tt0453418","2","3","The characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of British society (or to be more accurate, of any society)."
"tt0453418","2","4","Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three ""protagonists"" for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject."
"tt0453418","2","5","Political correctness flies out the window in every episode."
"tt0453418","2","6","If you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable, then Bromwell High will not disappoint!"
"tt0064354","3","0","""All the world's a stage and its people actors in it""--or something like that."
"tt0064354","3","1","Who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pit--or even at the theatre door?"
"tt0064354","3","2","Why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience, including the story itself?"
"tt0064354","3","3","This film was a grand experiment that said: ""Hey!"
"tt0064354","3","4","the story is you and it needs more than your attention, it needs your active participation""."
"tt0064354","3","5","""Sometimes we bring the story to you, sometimes you have to go to the story."""
"tt0064354","3","6","Alas no one listened, but that does not mean it should not have been said."
"tt0064354","4","0","FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in New York in the 1960s (the origins of Off Off Broadway)."
"tt0064354","4","1","Though it's not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant, darkly funny, even more often deeply disturbing tale about love, sex, personal liberty, and revenge, a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when Congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our Constitution."
"tt0064354","4","2","The story is not about being gay, though -- it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate."
"tt0064354","4","3","On the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any great fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in America."
"tt0064354","4","4","The stage version won international acclaim in its original production, it toured the U.S. and Europe, and with others of its kind, influenced almost all theatre that came after it."
"tt0064354","4","5","Luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway)."
"tt0064354","4","6","This is not a mainstream, easy-to-take, studio film -- this is an aggressive, unsettling, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget."
"tt0064354","4","7","And it just might change the way you see the world..."
"tt0100680","5","0","I came in in the middle of this film so I had no idea about any credits or even its title till I looked it up here, where I see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators."
"tt0100680","5","1","I'm on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as I watched: the beautiful and sensitive score written in a Coplandesque Americana style."
"tt0100680","5","2","My surprise was great when I discovered the score to have been written by none other than John Williams himself."
"tt0100680","5","3","True he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as Schindler's List but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as Star Wars."
"tt0100680","5","4","But in my opinion what Williams has written for this movie surpasses anything I've ever heard of his for tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie."
"tt0100680","5","5","And another recent score of his, for Catch Me if You Can, shows still more wit and sophistication."
"tt0100680","5","6","As to Stanley and Iris, I like education movies like How Green was my Valley and Konrack, that one with John Voigt and his young African American charges in South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc."
"tt0100680","5","7","They tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening, a story which can't be told often enough."
"tt0100680","5","8","This one is an excellent addition to that genre."
"tt0100680","6","0","Fair drama/love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love.The acting here is good but the film fails in cinematography,screenplay,directing and editing.The story/script is only average at best.This film will be enjoyed by Fonda and De Niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious level.It would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy......."
"tt0100680","7","0","Although I didn't like Stanley & Iris tremendously as a film, I did admire the acting."
"tt0100680","7","1","Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie."
"tt0100680","7","2","I haven't always been a fan of Fonda's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time."
"tt0100680","7","3","De Niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold."
"tt0100680","7","4","He gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can't care for him anymore that will break your heart."
"tt0100680","7","5","I wouldn't really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment, but I will say you won't see much bette acting anywhere."
"tt0100680","8","0","Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves."
"tt0100680","8","1","I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write."
"tt0100680","8","2","This film simply smacked of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it."
"tt0100680","8","3","2 thumbs up."
"tt0100680","9","0","Working-class romantic drama from director Martin Ritt is as unbelievable as they come, yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both terrific)."
"tt0100680","9","1","She's a widow who can't move on, he's illiterate and a closet-inventor--you can probably guess the rest."
"tt0100680","9","2","Adaptation of Pat Barker's novel ""Union Street"" (a better title!)"
"tt0100680","9","3","is so laid-back it verges on bland, and the film's editing is a mess, but it's still pleasant; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy."
"tt0100680","9","4","There are no overtures to serious issues (even the illiteracy angle is just a plot-tool for the ensuing love story) and no real fireworks, though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree."
"tt0100680","9","5","The finale is pure fluff--and cynics will find it difficult to swallow--though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn't really be satisfying any other way."
"tt0100680","9","6","*** from ****"
"tt0100680","10","0","I'm a male, not given to women's movies, but this is really a well done special story."
"tt0100680","10","1","I have no personal love for Jane Fonda as a person but she does one Hell of a fine job, while DeNiro is his usual superb self."
"tt0100680","10","2","Everything is so well done: acting, directing, visuals, settings, photography, casting."
"tt0100680","10","3","If you can enjoy a story of real people and real love - this is a winner."
"tt0100680","11","0","Liked Stanley & Iris very much."
"tt0100680","11","1","Acting was very good."
"tt0100680","11","2","Story had a unique and interesting arrangement."
"tt0100680","11","3","The absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing."
"tt0100680","11","4","Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings."
"tt0100680","11","5","Very enjoyable movie."
"tt0100680","12","0","Liked Stanley & Iris very much."
"tt0100680","12","1","Acting was very good."
"tt0100680","12","2","Story had a unique and interesting arrangement."
"tt0100680","12","3","The absence of violence and sex was refreshing."
"tt0100680","12","4","Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings."
"tt0100680","12","5","Very enjoyable movie."
"tt0100680","13","0","The production quality, cast, premise, authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?)"
"tt0100680","13","1","locale and lush John Williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item."
"tt0100680","13","2","Unfortunately, all we got was a passable 2 star ""decent"" flick, mostly memorable for what it tried to do.........bring an art house style film mainstream."
"tt0100680","13","3","The small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself, and if well done, will satisfy most grownups."
"tt0100680","13","4","Jane Fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable."
"tt0100680","13","5","I wondered why she wasn't doing a post doctorate at Yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in Waterbury."
"tt0100680","13","6","Robert DiNiro's character was just a bit too contrived."
"tt0100680","13","7","An illiterate, nice guy loser who turns out to actually be, with a little help from Jane's character, a 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison."
"tt0100680","13","8","This genre has been more successfully handled by ""Nobody's Fool"" in the mid 90s and this year's (2003) ""About Schmidt."""
"tt0100680","13","9","I wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those efforts."
"tt0100680","13","10","I'll give it an ""A"" for effort."
"tt0100680","14","0","This film has a special place in my heart, as when I caught it the first time, I was teaching adult literacy."
"tt0100680","14","1","It rang very true to me and even an outstanding student I had at the time."
"tt0100680","14","2","There are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion, and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation."
"tt0100680","14","3","Excellent performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro that rank with their best work, a great turn by a young Martha Plimpton, an inspiring story line, and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience."
"tt0100680","15","0","I guess if a film has magic, I don't need it to be fluid or seamless."
"tt0100680","15","1","It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc."
"tt0100680","15","2","Magic in this film: the scene in the library."
"tt0100680","15","3","There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix."
"tt0100680","15","4","Both characters are smart."
"tt0100680","15","5","Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood."
"tt0100680","15","6","Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took."
"tt0100680","15","7","In both their faults and strengths, the characters compliment each other."
"tt0100680","15","8","It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job."
"tt0100680","15","9","And while these ""mysteries"" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems somewhat contrived."
"tt0100680","15","10","I assume no one took the time to rethink the script."
"tt0100680","15","11","Even so, it's a good moviejust imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!"
"tt0100680","16","0","I found this to be a so-so romance/drama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it."
"tt0100680","16","1","It's not a Hallmark Hall Of Fame-type family film with sleeping-before-marriage considered ""normal"" behavior but considering it stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would have expected a lot rougher movie, at least language-wise."
"tt0100680","16","2","The most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult."
"tt0100680","16","3","That's the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but, to be honest, the film isn't that memorable."
"tt0100680","16","4","It's still a fairly mild, nice tale that I would be happy to recommend."
"tt0100680","17","0","This is a complex film that explores the effects of Fordist and Taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations."
"tt0100680","17","1","There are constant references to assembly line production, where workers are treated as cogs in a machine, overseen by managers wielding clipboards, controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed, and firing workers (Stanley) who meet all criteria (as his supervisor says, are always on time, are hard workers, do good work) but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake."
"tt0100680","17","2","This system destroys families - Stanley has to send his father to a nursing home (where he quickly dies) after Stanley loses his job."
"tt0100680","17","3","Iris' daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant."
"tt0100680","17","4","References are made to the fact that now, with declining wages, both partners need to work, the implication being that there's nobody left at home to care for the kids."
"tt0100680","17","5","Iris' husband is dead from an illness, and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care, the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care."
"tt0100680","17","6","Iris' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and/or teeth job (even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them)."
"tt0100680","17","7","The one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail (presumably, he's also black, and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates)."
"tt0100680","17","8","She remarks that he, like her, ""is doing time"" - her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave."
"tt0100680","17","9","Stanley, however, still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of Fordist capitalism."
"tt0100680","17","10","He cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy - he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract, as Iris' brother in law does (suggesting that he ""married the wrong sister"")."
"tt0100680","17","11","He does not, as Iris says, conform to the work-eat-sleep routine of everyone else; rather, he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way, in a sort of Bauhaus ideal."
"tt0100680","17","12","This was the dream of early modernists and 1920's socialists (such as the Bauhaus) - to use technology to provide for all basic needs, allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations."
"tt0100680","17","13","He is also outside of traditional gender relations."
"tt0100680","17","14","He cooks, he cleans, he cares for his family, and he knows how to iron."
"tt0100680","17","15","Iris, on the other hand, lives in a traditionally male role - she's a factory worker, the mains source of income for her (extended) family, and she brings Stanley into the public realm, traditionally off-limits to women."
"tt0100680","17","16","By teaching him to read and write, she gives him access to the world of knowledge, also traditionally gendered male."
"tt0100680","17","17","Literacy here is used as a metaphor for the (traditionally masculine) public realm and the systems of circulation (monetary, vehicular, cultural) that enable participation in the public realm."
"tt0100680","17","18","Without this access, Stanley is feminized - the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning."
"tt0100680","17","19","He is excluded from all regular circulations, unable to participate in the monetary (can't open a bank account), in the vehicular (can't get a driver's license, can't ride the bus), and in the social (he asks if he exists if he can't write his name)."
"tt0100680","17","20","After learning to read, he grabs books on auto repair, farming, and spirituality (the Bible)."
"tt0100680","17","21","The Word of God is therefore relativized, placed on the same value plane as how-to books."
"tt0100680","17","22","In fact, organized religion in general is only very occasionally present - the Bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find Stanley and Iris having sex."
"tt0100680","17","23","It is, however, acknowledged as a moral force - Iris, clearly a character devoted to living a ""good"" life, mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatching."
"tt0100680","17","24","Once able to read, he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan, a car, and a house, taking his place at the head of the family, the breadwinner."
"tt0100680","17","25","Presumably, he's an industrial designer, dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce."
"tt0100680","17","26","This ending, probably the only bit of conventional Hollywood in the film, is so incongruous with all that has come before that I at least wonder if it wasn't forced in by some Studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feel-good ending and its potential effect on the bottom line."
"tt0100680","17","27","Now that, according to the pundits, we've comfortably moved on to post-industrial capitalism, the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel, as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period."
"tt0100680","17","28","Nevertheless, it's highly recommended - at least if you want to exercise your brain."
"tt0100680","17","29","Disregard the ending, and it's close to a perfect 10."
"tt0100680","18","0","`Stanley and Iris' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life."
"tt0100680","18","1","Stanley's life is difficult, because he never learned to read or write."
"tt0100680","18","2","Iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley."
"tt0100680","18","3","She decides to teach Stanley how to read at her home in her spare time."
"tt0100680","18","4","Over time they become romantically involved."
"tt0100680","18","5","After Stanley learns to read, he goes off to a good job in Chicago, only to return to Iris and ask her to marry him."
"tt0100680","18","6","It's a really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today's films."
"tt0100680","18","7","A good film all round."
"tt0100680","19","0","I just read the comments of TomReynolds2004 and feel I have to jump in here."
"tt0100680","19","1","I understand he doesn't like the film, but his reasons are not evident."
"tt0100680","19","2","My feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sorrow."
"tt0100680","19","3","Each of these two people, as portrayed, have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry, yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other."
"tt0100680","19","4","Only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire, sentimental and sappy."
"tt0100680","19","5","I really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances."
"tt0100680","19","6","I have every reason to dislike Jane Fonda for her Vietnam era actions, but personal feelings apart, she is fabulous in this role."
"tt0100680","19","7","Robert DeNiro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities."
"tt0100680","19","8","This is the first I have seen DeNiro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like it."
"tt0100680","19","9","This film was a big surprise when I first viewed it and I look forward to seeing it again."
"tt0100680","20","0","'Stanley and Iris' show the triumph of the human spirit."
"tt0100680","20","1","For Stanley, it's the struggle to become literate and realize his potential."
"tt0100680","20","2","For Iris, it's to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow."
"tt0100680","20","3","The beauty of the movie is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda do together, starting and stopping, before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on."
"tt0100680","20","4","In that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is, thus being credible."
"tt0100680","20","5","Unlike some other reviewers I found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture."
"tt0100680","20","6","The supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances."
"tt0100680","20","7","All in all an excellent movie."
"tt0100680","20","8","The best thing I take from it is Hope."
