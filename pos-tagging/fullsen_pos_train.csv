"1","tt0033045","2105","1","Set in World Depression Era Prague, this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters, only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop, who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague."
"2","tt0033045","2105","2","Add a little twist the owner is convinced that his favorite employee Stewart is having an affair with the owner's wife, leaving Stewart briefly 'fired', along with an admission that the sales girl 'liked' Stewart all along, the happy ending is inevitable."
"3","tt0033045","2105","3","Although VERY dated references to poverty and I have a wife and two kids to consider are over used, along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure, like a musical cigar box, are out of reach for common people's enjoyment, this film is much more effective and more credible than the 1990s re make ""You've Got Mail""."
"4","tt0033045","2105","4","In the re make starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the actual odds of the chain of events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended."""
"5","tt0033045","2105","5","Shop Around The Corner"" is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated, less hectic, and more romantic time and place known as a novelist's Utopia."
"6","tt0033045","2105","6","Lovers of Classic Romantic Comedies will enjoy this picture!"
"7","tt0033045","2106","1","Would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one."
"8","tt0033045","2106","2","I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement."
"9","tt0033045","2106","3","Margaret Sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought out the best in each other."
"10","tt0033045","2106","4","This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most winning performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot."
"11","tt0033045","2106","5","The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy."
"12","tt0033045","2106","6","Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a triumph."
"13","tt0033045","2106","7","With some of the wittiest dialogue American movies of the 30's has to offer."
"14","tt0033045","2107","1","I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other LaserDiscs from eBay."
"15","tt0033045","2107","2","Usually, I am into war and action movies but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies."
"16","tt0033045","2107","3","If you are bored by today's special FX films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out Shop Around the Corner on a quiet evening."
"17","tt0033045","2107","4","What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency."
"18","tt0033045","2107","5","There is nothing fake or pretentious about them."
"19","tt0033045","2107","6","Take Mr."
"20","tt0033045","2107","7","Matuschek for example: When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself."
"21","tt0033045","2107","8","Not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of Stewart."
"22","tt0033045","2107","9","OK, weired example."
"23","tt0033045","2107","10","Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable."
"24","tt0033045","2107","11","Yet still, I liked it a lot."
"25","tt0033045","2107","12","If you likes Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart."
"26","tt0033045","2108","1","A warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it."
"27","tt0033045","2108","2","The key to this film's success is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low key, unfussy performances."
"28","tt0033045","2108","3","As a result, you fall in love with virtually all of them."
"29","tt0033045","2108","4","There's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which I appreciated."
"30","tt0033045","2108","5","Loneliness is a major theme, most obviously represented in the character of the shop's owner and manager, played wonderfully by Frank Morgan."
"31","tt0033045","2108","6","He discovers that he's being cuckolded by his wife, and realizes that the successful life he's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it."
"32","tt0033045","2108","7","This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant, because they're both reaching out to this unseen other, who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met."
"33","tt0033045","2108","8","Of course we know everything will turn out right in the end, but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy."
"34","tt0033045","2108","9","Lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry."
"35","tt0033045","2108","10","The little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family, and that's exactly how it feels to us as well."
"36","tt0033045","2108","11","This is a wonderful, unsung romance."
"37","tt0033045","2108","12","Grade: A+"
"38","tt0033045","2109","1","I have passed several times on watching this since I figured it was some dumb, sappy, dated romantic comedy."
"39","tt0033045","2109","2","Well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated."
"40","tt0033045","2109","3","However, it is not overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness."
"41","tt0033045","2109","4","You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out quite as you had expected."
"42","tt0033045","2109","5","But, there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic."
"43","tt0033045","2109","6","If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them."
"44","tt0033045","2110","1","So much has been written about the film's plot, the wonderful acting performance, the script, the melancholy, bittersweet atmosphere, the superb direction what can I add."
"45","tt0033045","2110","2","Just watch for one of the most heart warming, beautifully acted, poignant scenes ever filmed."
"46","tt0033045","2110","3","It is Christmas eve and Frank Morgan's character the owner of the shop Mr."
"47","tt0033045","2110","4","Matuschekis recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt."
"48","tt0033045","2110","5","As each of his employees leave he invites them to a Christmas dinner."
"49","tt0033045","2110","6","Each and everyone of them politely turn him down."
"50","tt0033045","2110","7","They all have plans for their own Christmas eve."
"51","tt0033045","2110","8","At this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene."
"52","tt0033045","2110","9","Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears."
"53","tt0033045","2110","10","Thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene."
"54","tt0033045","2110","11","The new employee, the errand boy, is the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snowy street scene."
"55","tt0033045","2110","12","Desperately Mr."
"56","tt0033045","2110","13","Matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him, he will treat him to all the wonderful Christmas food that this errand boy has probably never seen!"
"57","tt0033045","2110","14","The chap is overwhelmed, he too is obviously as lonely as Mr."
"58","tt0033045","2110","15","Matuschek and together they can have a wonderful Christmas meal."
"59","tt0033045","2110","16","Every time I see this scene it moves me."
"60","tt0033045","2110","17","If you manage to get the delightful DVD look at the great trailer with Frank Morgan introducing himself as Mr."
"61","tt0033045","2110","18","Matuschek and an appearance by the director of the film the talented Ernst Lubitsch."
"62","tt0033045","2110","19","This film is a joy from beginning to end."
"63","tt0033045","2111","1","'The Shop Around the Corner 1940' is a pleasant romantic comedy, not the sort that I will hold dear to me until the end of my days, but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation."
"64","tt0033045","2111","2","By 1940, director Ernst Lubitsch had long ago taken Hollywood by storm, and his famed ""Lubitsch touch"" had become a sparkling commercial trademark."
"65","tt0033045","2111","3","This film was planned for a 1939 release, but scheduling conflicts meant that James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were unavailable for filming."
"66","tt0033045","2111","4","Rather than substituting either of his main stars, Lubitsch decided to postpone production, in the meantime directing Greta Garbo in 'Ninotchka 1939.'"
"67","tt0033045","2111","5","When it was finally completed, 'The Shop Around the Corner' appears to have been met with relative indifference, receiving zero Oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by Samson Raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and Frank Morgan in a supporting role."
"68","tt0033045","2111","6","Time, nevertheless, has betrayed the film's massive and enduring influence, with high profile remakes including 'In the Good Old Summertime 1949' and 'You've Got Mail 1998.'"
"69","tt0033045","2111","7","At its surface, one might assume 'The Shop Around the Corner' to simply be the story of two lovers, Klara Novak Sullavan and Alfred Kralik Stewart, who love each other without knowing it."
"70","tt0033045","2111","8","However, Lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that."
"71","tt0033045","2111","9","It's the story of Matuschek and Company, a stylish gift shop in Budapest, and the various human relationships that make the store such a close knit family."
"72","tt0033045","2111","10","When store owner Hugo Matuschek Frank Morgan begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife, we witness the breakdown of two families, both at home and at work."
"73","tt0033045","2111","11","There's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the United States  perhaps in the blustery streets of New York  but Lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in Europe, the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep."
"74","tt0033045","2111","12","This subtle subtext brings a more meaningful, personal touch to the film  in fact, even as I write this review, I'm beginning to appreciate the story even more."
"75","tt0033045","2111","13","Sullavan and Stewart are both lovely in their respective roles, but I think that it's the supporting cast that really make the film."
"76","tt0033045","2111","14","Each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix, and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable."
"77","tt0033045","2111","15","I especially liked how Lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards Hugo Matuschek, who, in any other film, would have been restricted to an underdeveloped, two dimensional portrayal."
"78","tt0033045","2111","16","Matuschek may have lost the love of his family, but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees, and you feel a heartwarming glow when, in the bitter cold of a Christmas Eve snowstorm, he finds companionship in a freckle faced young errand boy Charles Smith."
"79","tt0033045","2111","17","This genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of Billy Wilder's later creations, for example, Boom Boom Jackson in 'The Fortune Cookie 1966' or Carlo Carlucci in 'Avanti!"
"80","tt0033045","2111","18","1972.'"
"81","tt0033045","2111","19","Of course, it doesn't really need saying, but Billy Wilder learned from the best."
"82","tt0033045","2112","1","In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan as Klara Novak gets a job as clerk in a gift shop; there, she bickers with co worker James Stewart as Alfred Kralik."
"83","tt0033045","2112","2","The two don't get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal."
"84","tt0033045","2112","3","Watching Ernst Lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying."
"85","tt0033045","2112","4","Even better is a sub plot involving shop owner Frank Morgan as Hugo Matuschek, who suspects his wife is having an affair."
"86","tt0033045","2112","5","Hiring a private detective, Mr."
"87","tt0033045","2112","6","Morgan confirms his wife of 22 years is having sex with one of his younger employees."
"88","tt0033045","2112","7","Morgan, painfully realizing, ""She just didn't want to grow old with me,"" and the supporting characters are what keeps this film from getting old."
"89","tt0033045","2112","8","The Shop Around the Corner 1/12/40 Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut"
"90","tt0033045","2113","1","The location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film, Balta Street in Budapest but it could really be in any place."
"91","tt0033045","2113","2","The small number of sets reflect a middle European design but it could be a shop around any corner."
"92","tt0033045","2113","3","The film is not about Budapest or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love, reflected in most of the main characters."
"93","tt0033045","2113","4","Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance, and the story unwinds to bring these two aspects together beautifully."
"94","tt0033045","2113","5","Hugo Matuschek, the owner of the shop, is having trouble with his wife, she only a voice at the end of the phone."
"95","tt0033045","2113","6","Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair."
"96","tt0033045","2113","7","Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments."
"97","tt0033045","2113","8","Mr Pirovitch's life is centred around his wife and children."
"98","tt0033045","2113","9","Pepi Katona 'plays Santa Claus' to a girl at Christmas."
"99","tt0033045","2113","10","You even sense that quiet Flora Katchuck, while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone."
"100","tt0033045","2113","11","The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama."
"101","tt0033045","2113","12","It moves effortlessly from scene to scene."
"102","tt0033045","2113","13","It is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again, simple yet profound."
"103","tt0033045","2113","14","The dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days."
"104","tt0033045","2113","15","All the acting is magnificent."
"105","tt0033045","2113","16","Even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect."
"106","tt0033045","2113","17","James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other perfectly."
"107","tt0033045","2113","18","He was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance."
"108","tt0033045","2113","19","Margaret Sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days."
"109","tt0033045","2113","20","Some of her other films are worth catching."
"110","tt0033045","2113","21","As Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing."
"111","tt0033045","2113","22","His moment of truth is very moving."
"112","tt0033045","2113","23","Gold stars all round to the performers."
"113","tt0033045","2113","24","It is a well worn phrase that they don't make them like they used to The vague re make 'You've Got Mail' was dire but in this case it is true."
"114","tt0033045","2113","25","The director Lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity."
"115","tt0033045","2114","1","Two warring shop workers in a leather goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box number aliases."
"116","tt0033045","2114","2","Within this simple idea and an everyday setting, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit, drama, poignancy and irony that never lets up."
"117","tt0033045","2114","3","Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well developed characters have their own sub plots and in jokes."
"118","tt0033045","2114","4","Although wrongly eclipsed by Stewart's big films of 39/40 Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr Smith this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlties unseen in the other films."
"119","tt0033045","2115","1","After seeing You've Got Mail and feeling disappointed, I decided to see the original movie which inspired this one, The Shop Around the Corner."
"120","tt0033045","2115","2","I was amazed at this movie."
"121","tt0033045","2115","3","It's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times."
"122","tt0033045","2115","4","The acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, that if you haven't seen it, I wish to urge you to see it today."
"123","tt0033045","2115","5","I'm not against re makes and sometimes I like the new version more than the original one, but this time have to admit that You've Got Mail is a poor adaption of this classic."
"124","tt0033045","2115","6","Don't miss it, go to your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!"
"125","tt0033045","2116","1","Has there ever been a movie more charming than this."
"126","tt0033045","2116","2","One of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives."
"127","tt0033045","2116","3","The center of it is the ""romance"" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals."
"128","tt0033045","2116","4","But there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including ""You've Got Mail"", the recent update of ""Shop"" they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs."
"129","tt0033045","2116","5","Everyone gets to be an intricate part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm."
"130","tt0033045","2116","6","One of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near tragic Frank Morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have Christmas dinner with."
"131","tt0033045","2116","7","A must see!"
"132","tt0033045","2116","8","out of"
"133","tt0033045","2117","1","Every time I watch this movie I am more impressed by the whole production."
"134","tt0033045","2117","2","I have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made."
"135","tt0033045","2117","3","Everyone involved is perfect; script, acting, direction, sets and editing."
"136","tt0033045","2117","4","Whilst James Stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance, and the supporting cast are magnificent, it is Margaret Sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was."
"137","tt0033045","2117","5","Her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve."
"138","tt0033045","2117","6","Lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best."
"139","tt0033045","2117","7","Watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take breathtaking."
"140","tt0033045","2118","1","THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is one of the sweetest and most feel good romantic comedies ever made."
"141","tt0033045","2118","2","There's just no getting around that, and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words."
"142","tt0033045","2118","3","It's not one of those films that tries too hard, nor does it come up with the oddest possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end."
"143","tt0033045","2118","4","In fact, all its charm is innate, contained within the characters and the setting and the plot... which is highly believable to boot."
"144","tt0033045","2118","5","It's easy to think that such a love story, as beautiful as any other ever told, could happen to you... a feeling you don't often get from other romantic comedies, however sweet and heart warming they may be."
"145","tt0033045","2118","6","Alfred Kralik James Stewart and Clara Novak Margaret Sullavan don't have the most auspicious of first meetings when she arrives in the shop Matuschek & Co. he's been working in for the past nine years, asking for a job."
"146","tt0033045","2118","7","They clash from the very beginning, mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it's opened he thinks it's a ludicrous idea; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired."
"147","tt0033045","2118","8","Their bickering takes them through the next six months, even as they both unconsciously, of course!"
"148","tt0033045","2118","9","fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through PO Box 237."
"149","tt0033045","2118","10","This would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on, except that THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is expertly fleshed out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters, from the fatherly but lonely Hugo Matuschek Frank Morgan himself, who learns that his shop really is his home; Pirovitch Felix Bressart, Kralik's sidekick and friend who always skitters out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion; smarmy pimp du jour Vadas Joseph Schildkraut who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous Kralik; and ambitious errand boy Pepi Katona William Tracy who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for Matuschek & Co."
"150","tt0033045","2118","11","The unpretentious love story between 'Dear Friends' is played out in this little shop in Budapest, Hungary, in which Kralik's unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirds to be along."
"151","tt0033045","2118","12","It's nice that everyone gets a story in this film; the supporting characters are well developed, and Matuschek's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one Alfred and Clara share."
"152","tt0033045","2118","13","His invitation to new errand boy Rudy Charles Smith for Christmas Eve dinner, made in the whirling, beautiful snow of a Hungarian winter, makes the audience glad that he is not alone; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it isn't this film's business to tell."
"153","tt0033045","2118","14","Aside from the love story, I must say that James Stewart is truly one of the best things about this film."
"154","tt0033045","2118","15","He doesn't play the full fledged Jimmy Stewart persona in this film c/f 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' for that; in fact Alfred Kralik is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind."
"155","tt0033045","2118","16","He's rather a brusque man, in fact, with little hint until, perhaps, the very end of the aw shucks down home boyish charm Stewart would soon come to patent."
"156","tt0033045","2118","17","When he finds out before Clara that they have been corresponding in secret, in fact, Kralik doesn't 'fess up he waits it out to see how far he can take the charade, especially since he quickly realises given his stormy relationship with Clara as boss and underling that loving the person he knows through the exchanged letters might not equate with loving the person herself."
"157","tt0033045","2118","18","His description to Clara of the fictional Matthias Popkin what a name!"
"158","tt0033045","2118","19","who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme, but also his way of proving that the letters don't reveal all there is to a man, just as her letters don't reveal all there is to her."
"159","tt0033045","2118","20","Stewart plays this role perfectly he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever Clara insults Mr."
"160","tt0033045","2118","21","Kralik, as she is often wont to do, even and especially to his face."
"161","tt0033045","2118","22","And yet one believes, underneath the brusqueness and professionalism, that he could reveal his identity with as much earnestness and sincerity and sheer hope as he eventually does."
"162","tt0033045","2118","23","Special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well."
"163","tt0033045","2118","24","Margaret Sullavan fares rather less well in the first half of the film, but she really comes into her own in the closing shop scene on Christmas Eve, when she almost gets her heart broken again by Alfred's most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart."
"164","tt0033045","2118","25","Frank Morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous Hugo Matuschek driven to nervous breakdown, the man who has to rediscover his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to 'grow old with him'."
"165","tt0033045","2118","26","And Felix Bressart plays the role of the meek but loyal Pirovitch wonderfully a Lubitsch regular, since he appears as a hilarious Russian ambassador in NINOTCHKA of particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend Alfred get the Christmas present the latter really wants... a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box Clara is so hung up on."
"166","tt0033045","2118","27","Ernst Lubitsch really does himself proud with this film for example, the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the Matuschek shop is well worth the effort, right down to the Hungarian names on the door, the wares and the cash register and so on."
"167","tt0033045","2118","28","But even though Lubitsch chose to have the story set in Hungary, the setting is actually universal: it could happen anywhere; it could happen to you."
"168","tt0033045","2118","29","Therein lies the charm of this simple story, these believable characters who really are people."
"169","tt0033045","2118","30","The snow on Christmas Eve is real as well, or at least as real as Lubitsch could make it he had snow machines brought in at great expense."
"170","tt0033045","2118","31","It is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable, that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be replicated."
"171","tt0033045","2118","32","No, not even in a remake like YOU'VE GOT MAIL."
"172","tt0033045","2118","33","This is really the Jimmy Stewart Christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE."
"173","tt0033045","2118","34","Not to detract from the merits of that other film, but there'd be no harm, and in fact a lot of good, done in watching THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER this Christmas instead."
"174","tt0033045","2118","35","It's sweet, funny, charming, and Stewart is impeccable in his role."
"175","tt0033045","2118","36","We should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could."
"176","tt0033045","2119","1","""The Shop Around the Corner"" is one of the great films from director Ernst Lubitsch."
"177","tt0033045","2119","2","In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it's filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart ."
"178","tt0033045","2119","3","They're the type of character actors that Hollywood sadly no longer employs."
"179","tt0033045","2119","4","In fact, the film itself is the kind of movie that Hollywood doesn't make anymore."
"180","tt0033045","2119","5","The makers of ""You've Got Mail"" claim their film to be a remake, but that's just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise."
"181","tt0033045","2119","6","Anyway, if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940's, you'll find ""The Shop Around the Corner"" to be nothing short of wonderful."
"182","tt0033045","2119","7","Just as good with repeat viewings."
"183","tt0033045","2119","8","Enjoy!"
"184","tt0033045","2120","1","James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co workers in a Budapest gift shop who don't really like each other, not knowing they're really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meet."
"185","tt0033045","2120","2","A very charming romantic comedy, very engagingly played by it's two likable stars and a very eager to please supporting cast."
"186","tt0033045","2120","3","The story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence don't quite know how to explain it that films today just don't have."
"187","tt0033045","2120","4","This can obviously be compared to the recent You've Got Mail, and the original wins in every way."
"188","tt0033045","2120","5","This is mandatory viewing each Christmas, I can't think of a better way to jumpstart a Christmas feel than this little gem."
"189","tt0033045","2121","1","This is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players."
"190","tt0033045","2121","2","It will make you laugh and it will make you cry."
"191","tt0033045","2121","3","The very end of the movie gets me to mist up every time."
"192","tt0033045","2121","4","If you want to see a great movie, this is it."
"193","tt0033045","2121","5","Jimmy Stewert supplies a wonderfully witty performance and Frank Morgan as Mr."
"194","tt0033045","2121","6","Matuschek is spellbinding."
"195","tt0033045","2121","7","Morgan's diversity of character is nothing short of amazing."
"196","tt0033045","2121","8","William Tracy as Pepi is terrific comic relief and delivers some of the movies most important lines and performances."
"197","tt0033045","2121","9","Felix Bressart delivers a fantastic performance as Perovitch, a stumbling bumbling shop worker who's life's ambition is to please those he works with."
"198","tt0033045","2121","10","It is a simple story of how close co workers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances."
"199","tt0033045","2122","1","Back in the day of the big studio system, the darndest casting decisions were made."
"200","tt0033045","2122","2","Good old all American James Stewart appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner."
"201","tt0033045","2122","3","Had I been casting the film, the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer."
"202","tt0033045","2122","4","His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing."
"203","tt0033045","2122","5","Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan."
"204","tt0033045","2122","6","Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her."
"205","tt0033045","2122","7","But is only this one where neither of them dies."
"206","tt0033045","2122","8","Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in New York."
"207","tt0033045","2122","9","In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then."
"208","tt0033045","2122","10","I think only Clark Gable was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty."
"209","tt0033045","2122","11","Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out."
"210","tt0033045","2122","12","But if you can accept Stewart, than you'll be seeing a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch."
"211","tt0033045","2122","13","The plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest don't get along in person."
"212","tt0033045","2122","14","But it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other."
"213","tt0033045","2122","15","Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife."
"214","tt0033045","2122","16","Though the leads are fine and Frank Morgan departs from his usual befuddled self, the two players who come off best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut."
"215","tt0033045","2122","17","Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions."
"216","tt0033045","2122","18","He makes himself very scarce."
"217","tt0033045","2122","19","And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to Frank Morgan."
"218","tt0033045","2122","20","You really hate people like that, I've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day."
"219","tt0033045","2122","21","Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time."
"220","tt0033045","2123","1","Of the three remakes of this plot, I like them all, I have all three on VHS and in addition have a copy of this one on DVD."
"221","tt0033045","2123","2","There is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re watchable."
"222","tt0033045","2123","3","In addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each."
"223","tt0033045","2123","4","Of course the main stars in this one are great, but the supporting actors are also superb."
"224","tt0033045","2123","5","I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi."
"225","tt0033045","2123","6","He was such a scene stealer that I have searched to find other movies he is in."
"226","tt0033045","2123","7","He appeared in many, but most are not available."
"227","tt0033045","2123","8","As the other comments, I also say buy this one."
"228","tt0033045","2124","1","This is a truly classic movie in its story, acting, and film presentation."
"229","tt0033045","2124","2","Wonderful actors are replete throughout the whole movie, Miss Sullivan, and Jimmy Stewart being the foremost characters."
"230","tt0033045","2124","3","In real life she greatly admired, and liked Jimmy, and indeed gave him his basically first acting roles, and helped him be more calm with his appearance on the set."
"231","tt0033045","2124","4","The ""chemistry"" between the two was always apparent, and so warm and enjoyable to behold."
"232","tt0033045","2124","5","She was such a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality portrayals."
"233","tt0033045","2124","6","The story of these two young people, and how they eventually come together in the end is charming to watch, and pure magical entertainment."
"234","tt0033045","2124","7","Heart warming presentations are also given by the other supporting actors in this marvelous story/movie."
"235","tt0033045","2124","8","I whole heartily give Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, that has a special appeal for all generations."
"236","tt0033045","2124","9","A must see for all!"
"237","tt0033045","2125","1","This, despite not being the original it began life as a play in Central Europe has weathered the several incarnations that followed MGM's own remake with period songs In The Good Old Summertime, the Broadway show She Loves Me, even the excellent theatre revival in Paris a couple of years ago and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat."
"238","tt0033045","2125","2","Several previous commenters have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s Hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today try, for example, removing Ugarte, Ferrari, Renault etc from Casablanca and yes you'd still have Rick and Ilsa and Viktor Lazslo but they'd just be frosting without the rich cake mixture below."
"239","tt0033045","2125","3","Jimmy Stewart and Maggie Sullavan WERE both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, Joseph Schildkraut and Andy Hardy's Sara Haden and this is BEFORE we factor in that Lubitsch 'touch'."
"240","tt0033045","2125","4","Okay, maybe they WERE a tad more naive, innocent even, in that Jurassic Age but how many genuine film lovers, sated with scatology, screwing and in your face sex, turn back to those days of Stories, Style, Slickness and Skill and wallow in great movies like this one."
"241","tt0033045","2125","5","By far the best thing about this technological age is not CSI but DVD that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the Matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it."
"242","tt0033045","2126","1","Much about love & life can be learned from watching the folks at THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.Ernst Lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film."
"243","tt0033045","2126","2","With sparkling dialogue courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie."
"244","tt0033045","2126","3","Always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers, and favoring sophistication over slapstick, the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive, enigmatic quality known as the Lubitsch touch.'"
"245","tt0033045","2126","4","Although the story is set in Budapest and there is a jumble of accents among the players this is of no consequence."
"246","tt0033045","2126","5","The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great American city or small town could easily be the locus for the action."
"247","tt0033045","2126","6","Jimmy Stewart & Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other without knowing it."
"248","tt0033045","2126","7","Their dialogue so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural perfectly conveys their confusion & quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates."
"249","tt0033045","2126","8","Theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema."
"250","tt0033045","2126","9","Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold."
"251","tt0033045","2126","10","An accomplished scene stealer, he allows no emotion to escape unvented."
"252","tt0033045","2126","11","Additionally, Morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments near the end when he determines that his store's newest employee, an impoverished youth, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve."
"253","tt0033045","2126","12","Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals, this time that of a toadying, sycophantic Lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him."
"254","tt0033045","2126","13","Gentle Felix Bressart has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop intrigues, yet remains a steadfast friend to Stewart."
"255","tt0033045","2126","14","Sara Haden graces the small role of a sales clerk."
"256","tt0033045","2126","15","William Tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force."
"257","tt0033045","2126","16","In tiny roles, Charles Halton plays a no nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous doctor."
"258","tt0033045","2126","17","Movie mavens will recognize Mary Carr & Mabel Colcord both uncredited in their single scene as Miss Sullavan's grandmother & aunt."
"259","tt0033045","2127","1","Calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading."
"260","tt0033045","2127","2","The genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formulaic and overly predictable."
"261","tt0033045","2127","3","The Shop Around the Corner does not suffer from these illnesses: it manages to create a recognisably middle/eastern European atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the also strong nominal leads; I avoid using the words 'supporting cast' as for example Mr."
"262","tt0033045","2127","4","Matuschek Frank Morgan has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance."
"263","tt0033045","2127","5","The 1998 film You've Got Mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen pal' idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake."
"264","tt0033045","2127","6","This is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie it shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that is all."
"265","tt0033045","2128","1","I just watched this on Turner Classic Movies Last night, for the first time ever seeing it, and I loved it."
"266","tt0033045","2128","2","I like lots of the older films, especially because of the absence of all the filthy language, and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's films."
"267","tt0033045","2128","3","I also think they were made much better in many but not all cases."
"268","tt0033045","2128","4","Jimmy Stewart is a special favorite of mine."
"269","tt0033045","2128","5","I just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and I enjoyed it thoroughly."
"270","tt0033045","2128","6","If you feel the same way about the older films I don't think you can go wrong with this one."
"271","tt0033045","2128","7","I believe ""You've Got Mail"" is a remakeeven though slightly different and also a very enjoyable film. of this film."
"272","tt0033045","2128","8","For a relaxing evening with a movie you don't have to be ashamed of if your kids or anyone walks in on your viewing, get this,or catch it on one of the classic movie channels."
"273","tt0033045","2129","1","Sweet romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is."
"274","tt0033045","2129","2","Naturally, they work together and can't stand each other."
"275","tt0033045","2129","3","You can guess the rest."
"276","tt0033045","2129","4","It's beautifully acted by the entire cast especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan, has a witty, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning."
"277","tt0033045","2129","5","It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself believing I was seeing Budapest!"
"278","tt0033045","2129","6","Everything looks so perfect and dream like."
"279","tt0033045","2129","7","A one of a kind film."
"280","tt0033045","2129","8","Don't miss it!"
"281","tt0033045","2130","1","A wonderful film, filled with great understated performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue."
"282","tt0033045","2130","2","What really distinguishes the film, however, is that undercurrent of sadness throughout."
"283","tt0033045","2130","3","The story is underscored by affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences."
"284","tt0033045","2130","4","Most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed, having been ripped apart by the beginning of World War II."
"285","tt0033045","2130","5","In fact, the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to the comic scenes."
"286","tt0033045","2130","6","Yet funny it is listen to Margaret Sullivan's harsh dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and watch his pained expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend ""of poetry and meanness""."
"287","tt0033045","2130","7","It's funny, pointed, and sad all at once."
"288","tt0033045","2130","8","A remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made."
"289","tt0033045","2131","1","This is a movie that gets better each time I see it."
"290","tt0033045","2131","2","There are so many nuanced performances in this."
"291","tt0033045","2131","3","William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief."
"292","tt0033045","2131","4","Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only ""villian"" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here."
"293","tt0033045","2131","5","Frank Morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, Mr."
"294","tt0033045","2131","6","Matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here."
"295","tt0033045","2131","7","I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch."
"296","tt0033045","2131","8","Very believable in every facet of his role."
"297","tt0033045","2131","9","The two leads are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman."
"298","tt0033045","2131","10","This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though."
"299","tt0033045","2131","11","The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him."
"300","tt0033045","2131","12","Mr."
"301","tt0033045","2131","13","Stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions."
"302","tt0033045","2131","14","Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding."
"303","tt0033045","2131","15","He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly."
"304","tt0033045","2131","16","In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium."
"305","tt0033045","2131","17","There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience."
"306","tt0033045","2131","18","At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft."
"307","tt0033045","2131","19","This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find."
"308","tt0033045","2131","20","I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart."
"309","tt0033045","2132","1","The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man vs. woman argue all the time but wind up in love type of Hollywood screwball romance/comedy."
"310","tt0033045","2132","2","I usually don't go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, and oozes with charm."
"311","tt0033045","2132","3","Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other well and make a very handsome couple."
"312","tt0033045","2132","4","The supporting cast is outstanding from the always likable Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut."
"313","tt0033045","2132","5","Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him do in his career."
"314","tt0033045","2132","6","He takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him."
"315","tt0033045","2132","7","That ""twist"" is another reason this film rises above others of its kind."
"316","tt0033045","2132","8","Once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds."
"317","tt0033045","2132","9","This is a great example of that."
"318","tt0033045","2132","10","In this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done."
"319","tt0033045","2132","11","I'll take this over the re make ""You've Got Mail,"" any day."
"320","tt0033045","2132","12","No comparison."
"321","tt0033045","2133","1","I have lost count of just how many times I have seen this movie I probably know the entire dialog backwards yet I am drawn to it time and again."
"322","tt0033045","2133","2","Set in Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the eligible bachelor ""Kralik"" who becomes the secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan's innocent ""Klara""."
"323","tt0033045","2133","3","Kralik secretly becomes Klara's pen friend, and at work together Klara confides in Kralik about the content of his Kralik's letters."
"324","tt0033045","2133","4","Clearly Kralik is besotted with Klara but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the ""pen friend""."
"325","tt0033045","2133","5","Confused."
"326","tt0033045","2133","6","Well you wont be this story has a sweet, almost sugary ending but we all know it is the ending we all want."
"327","tt0033045","2133","7","Other characters worth mentioning are Frank Morgan playing his usual role, this time as the shop's owner ""Hugo Matuschek"", Felix Bressart as ""Pirovitch"", Kralik's confidant."
"328","tt0033045","2133","8","Joseph Schildkraut as the womanising arrogant ""Vadas"" so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning."
"329","tt0033045","2133","9","Finally William Tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his over confident upstart of a shop junior ""Pepi Katona""."
"330","tt0033045","2133","10","Recently re made as ""You've Got Mail"" starring Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original although I suspect younger audiences would disagree."
"331","tt0033045","2133","11","If this film is on in your area over Christmas, I suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of Kleenex handy."
"332","tt0033045","2134","1","Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to the American cinema is enormous."
"333","tt0033045","2134","2","His legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever, as is the case with ""The Shop Around the Corner""."
"334","tt0033045","2134","3","This film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play, without the charm or elegance of Mr."

"336","tt0033045","2134","5","Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked in several films together."
"337","tt0033045","2134","6","Their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all."
"338","tt0033045","2134","7","Both stars are delightful as the pen pals that don't know of one another, but who fate had them working together in the same shop in Budapest."
"339","tt0033045","2134","8","The reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture."
"340","tt0033045","2134","9","In here, we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, playing the owner of the shop."
"341","tt0033045","2134","10","Also, we see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing impressive work in making us believe that yes, they are in Budapest."
"342","tt0033045","2134","11","That is why these films will live forever!"
"343","tt0037514","4455","1","Though I liked On the Town better I really liked it."
"344","tt0037514","4455","2","I'm a new comer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly."
"345","tt0037514","4455","3","Though I had heard of them I had never seen anything with them in it until recently."
"346","tt0037514","4455","4","The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain that made me a fan of Gene's."
"347","tt0037514","4455","5","I think that is better too."
"348","tt0037514","4455","6","But I thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it's an awesome movie and I love it."
"349","tt0037514","4455","7","Frank and Gene make a good team."
"350","tt0037514","4455","8","I have yet to see them together in Take me out to the Ballgame."
"351","tt0037514","4455","9","But I'm sticking to my guns bu saying that I really enjoyed it, and that I love it!"
"352","tt0037514","4456","1","Lots of singing and dancing in this one, especially by Gene Kelly."
"353","tt0037514","4456","2","Two sailors go on liberty to see if they can find love and romance."
"354","tt0037514","4456","3","They meet up with a woman who is trying to break into show business."
"355","tt0037514","4456","4","Musical lovers only."
"356","tt0037514","4457","1","Yes, this is one of the great musical movies I grew up with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson."
"357","tt0037514","4457","2","The music and dancing is superb."
"358","tt0037514","4457","3","I understand Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is quite unique for the time."
"359","tt0037514","4457","4","Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra."
"360","tt0037514","4457","5","She is one of Hollywood's great underrated stars."
"361","tt0037514","4457","6","I saw this again on A&E TV and as well have it in my old VCR tapes."
"362","tt0037514","4457","7","Never get tired of these old musicals."
"363","tt0037514","4457","8","Whatever happened to Hollywood.."
"364","tt0037514","4458","1","This has some excellent spots but the length of the film can not sustain the wafer thin plot."
"365","tt0037514","4458","2","It is another sailors on leave film, zippier than Astaire's 'Follow the Fleet' but not as good as 'On The Town'."
"366","tt0037514","4458","3","Kathryn Grayson is bland but Kelly and Sinatra work well together."
"367","tt0037514","4458","4","Their 'If you Knew Susie' number is hilarious as they make up the song as they sing it."
"368","tt0037514","4458","5","'I Begged Her' is also fun with Sinatra showing how adept he was at hoofing."
"369","tt0037514","4458","6","Sinatra's solo songs are dull and seem to be inserted to show off his singing rather than as part of the story."
"370","tt0037514","4458","7","Fortunately there are accomplished supporting actors like Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and an unlikely but impertubable Jose Iturbi as himself, to keep one watching."
"371","tt0037514","4458","8","Kelly is the star of the film, although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children, which Astaire never did."
"372","tt0037514","4458","9","Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and latches on to the Kelly character."
"373","tt0037514","4458","10","He also visit a school resulting in him telling the children a fictitious story of his life in the Pomeranian !"
"374","tt0037514","4458","11","navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated Jerry Mouse."
"375","tt0037514","4458","12","In another scene he dances a charming Mexican Hat Dance with a sublimely grave faced little girl, Sharon McManus, that is entrancing and sweet."
"376","tt0037514","4458","13","Very pleasant then but a bit too long."
"377","tt0037514","4458","14","A taster of better musicals to come."
"378","tt0037514","4459","1","For such films like `Anchors Aweigh', few have been bestowed with as many Academy Award accolades in a warm up for happy hour."
"379","tt0037514","4459","2","Either 1945 was a beleaguered year for good film or they were still suffering advance shock by Billy Wilder's `The Lost Weekend' that they wrote anything starting with A on the ballot for best picture to please the still musical picture faithful public."
"380","tt0037514","4459","3","Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in `Singin' in the Rain', then there had to be something wrong with the behind the scenes rigging systems at MGM."
"381","tt0037514","4459","4","Of course, the studio is on its best behaviour during this much lauded tour of the great studios and of Hollywood itself, handy for those stuck on the other side of the world."
"382","tt0037514","4459","5","Yet a sailor suit musical with the brilliant talents of Gene and Frank Sinatra is certainly an enjoyable farce, despite the need for more people to yawn at the previews for the musical so today's audiences wouldn't be slapped with an unnecessary runtime."
"383","tt0037514","4459","6","There have been many longer pieces before and since, but in this case all of the charming Kathryn Grayson's scenes could have been eliminated."
"384","tt0037514","4459","7","Until the viewing of `Kiss Me Kate' it may have been necessary non opera enthusiasts to watch any of her films with remote control in hand."
"385","tt0037514","4459","8","If there was a need to practice picking up women for 1949's `On the Town', then perhaps the shore leave lucky sailors did not have to promise an audition with Jose Iturbi and strike up the piano for a whole hearted `Susie' rendition."
"386","tt0037514","4459","9","Few are lucky to get a screen test at the golden studios of MGM."
"387","tt0037514","4459","10","Then few are even luckier to be attended to."
"388","tt0037514","4459","11","There are no regrets to be had about the successful screen tests of Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson, but it makes the continual non opera enthusiast hope for the eventual pink slip to be handed out to both."
"389","tt0037514","4459","12","But for all, the star talents are good shape and an above average score thrown in with a slight, but fun great navy story intertwined with young ambitious navy boys good for late bursts of wartime morale, makes `Anchors' at least doesn't question picking the wrong MGM film."
"390","tt0037514","4459","13","The direction holds up as the cast carries the story in lovely colour cinematography."
"391","tt0037514","4459","14","Whenever anyone bursts into music or song, the film makes for a joyous occasion."
"392","tt0037514","4459","15","The natural highlight of the film is Gene Kelly's cartoon adventures in a fantasyland, climaxing in a brilliant dance with Jerry the mouse."
"393","tt0037514","4459","16","This is a well deserved masterpiece number of Kelly's career, and it's nice to know he thought of it before Fred Astaire started taking to dancing on walls and ceilings."
"394","tt0037514","4459","17","It's not exactly sitting down to a triple flavour, rainbow sprinkled, chocolate wafer, cream and cherry and banana split sundae, but it is a square solid lump of sugar that somehow eventually melts in your mouth and despite the guilt, is still a pleasant feeling."
"395","tt0037514","4459","18","Rating: 7/10"
"396","tt0037514","4460","1","Ah, a Kelly/Sinatra sailor suit musical."
"397","tt0037514","4460","2","So familiar, right."
"398","tt0037514","4460","3","Yes, but this isn't the one you usually hear about."
"399","tt0037514","4460","4","On The Town's that a way."
"400","tt0037514","4460","5","But if you stick around, you might learn something."
"401","tt0037514","4460","6","Okay, probably not."
"402","tt0037514","4460","7","Anyway, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a three or four day leave."
"403","tt0037514","4460","8","Joe is the ""Sea Wolf"" and Clarence, the bookish type, begs Joe to get him a ""dame""."
"404","tt0037514","4460","9","Now, after they're picked up by the coppers they get little Donald home."
"405","tt0037514","4460","10","That's where they meet Susie, that temptress, that jezebel."
"406","tt0037514","4460","11","Just kidding!"
"407","tt0037514","4460","12","Clarence falls in love with her."
"408","tt0037514","4460","13","At least he thinks he does."
"409","tt0037514","4460","14","Is he right."
"410","tt0037514","4460","15","Or is he a moron."
"411","tt0037514","4460","16","Or is he just misguided by society."
"412","tt0037514","4460","17","Find out all this and more when you watch trumpet fanfare ANCHORS AWEIGH!"
"413","tt0037514","4460","18","P.S."
"414","tt0037514","4460","19","If you want to see Kathryn Grayson be anything but sickeningly sweet, try Kiss Me Kate 1953."
"415","tt0037514","4461","1","I really liked this movie."
"416","tt0037514","4461","2","I have seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best."
"417","tt0037514","4461","3","I would actually put it above his more famous American in Paris."
"418","tt0037514","4461","4","Sometimes it seems the story gets lost in Gene Kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this movie."
"419","tt0037514","4461","5","It is definitely worth renting."
"420","tt0037514","4462","1","One of the first of the best musicals, Anchors Aweigh features several memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly dancing with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dancing with 7 year old Sharon McManus, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi playing piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi conducting, and much more."
"421","tt0037514","4462","2","The Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath, through transparent keys, and Grayson singing, seen through the finder of another camera."
"422","tt0037514","4462","3","The plot is thin, but you get involved from Kelly's & Sinatra's enthusiasm."
"423","tt0037514","4462","4","Sailor's on leave, they have to take home a runaway boy Dean Stockwell and Sinatra falls for his aunt."
"424","tt0037514","4462","5","To set him up with the aunt Grayson, Kelly suggests that Sinatra can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi."
"425","tt0037514","4462","6","But Sinatra's young and naive in this one, and in his own sung words falls in love too fast."
"426","tt0037514","4462","7","While they're trying to contact Iturbi, who's never available, he starts to fall for another girl Barbara Britton; but Kelly's now falling love with Grayson."
"427","tt0037514","4462","8","Anchors Aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live action / cartoon sequence with Tom and Jerry, but there's a lot more here that's worth a look."
"428","tt0037514","4462","9","I'm giving it nine stars because, while it's not quite as good as the best musicals Singin' In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma it is one of the first of their class of Technicolor big productions perhaps Meet Me In St."
"429","tt0037514","4462","10","Louis was the first, and better than most others."
"430","tt0037514","4463","1","A recent viewing of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT has given me the urge to watch many of the classic MGM musicals from the forties and fifties."
"431","tt0037514","4463","2","ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a lesser film than ON THE TOWN."
"432","tt0037514","4463","3","The songs aren't as good, nor is the chemistry between the characters."
"433","tt0037514","4463","4","But the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites, such as Tchaikovsky."
"434","tt0037514","4463","5","And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top, and then running down the steps, while dozens of pianists play on the piano, is the best scene in the film, even though the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous."
"435","tt0037514","4463","6","Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing."
"436","tt0037514","4463","7","Sinatra then croons, ""I Fall in Love Too Easily,"" before having his epiphany about whom he loves."
"437","tt0037514","4463","8","The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution free air Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, let alone the mid 1940s.!, and the piano music is absolutely glorious."
"438","tt0037514","4463","9","MGM certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these."
"439","tt0037514","4464","1","Incredibly ARTISTIC NOBODY COULD MAKE THEM NOW I THINK.It seem to be perfect the biggest and the greatest musical ever made listen to the beautiful songs the are quite poetry."
"440","tt0037514","4464","2","I'M Italian AND ADMIRED BY American MUSICAL. why can't you do something like that now."
"441","tt0037514","4464","3","American were the best and for that i absolutely show my devotion to you with this movie.there are words to describes the perfection of this movie. all of a sudden my heart sings, what makes the sunset. i fall in love to easily,jealousy...and the scene with Tom and Jerry. the greatest without reserve. if you you doesn't know your eyes are not open my friends you must see it and appreciate...wake up!"
"442","tt0037514","4465","1","ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but I wouldn't rate it up there with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON."
"443","tt0037514","4465","2","This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared in together."
"444","tt0037514","4465","3","Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors on leave in Hollywood who befriend a young boy Dean Stockwellwho introduces them to his attractive young aunt Kathryn Grayson a struggling actress who is working as an extra at MGM."
"445","tt0037514","4465","4","Though both guys are initially attracted to Grayson, she eventually voices a preference to Joe but Clarence later hooks up with a waitress Pamela Brittonwho, he learns is from his hometown of Brooklyn."
"446","tt0037514","4465","5","The paper thin plot leaves room for several great musical numbers including ""We Hate to Leave"", Joe and Clarence's lament to their fellow sailors as they're leaving the ship; Grayson's torrid rendition of ""Jalousie""; Sinatra's dreamy rendition of ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" a number which is sadly deleted from some prints of this film, and ""The Worry Song"", a fantasy dance that Kelly does with animated Jerry the Mouse from Tom and Jerry fame."
"447","tt0037514","4465","6","Kelly also does a sort of Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet which rivals his Pirate's Ballet in the later THE PIRATE."
"448","tt0037514","4465","7","Kelly is in peak form here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Sinatra's endearingly shy character here is undeniably sexy."
"449","tt0037514","4465","8","An entertaining diversion for fans of the MGM musical factory."
"450","tt0037514","4466","1","""Anchors Aweigh"" is the product of the classic MGM musical production unit, and on the whole the film is every enjoyable  good music by Jule Styne and others, excellent dancing by Gene Kelly and even a passable job by Frank Sinatra, and a funny well paced script."
"451","tt0037514","4466","2","The only major element I would criticize would be the casting of Kathryn Grayson, whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudo operatic warbling from the petite Miss."
"452","tt0037514","4466","3","Kelly plays a naval serviceman named Joseph Brady, a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose Valentino charms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middle American name of Clarence Sinatra."
"453","tt0037514","4466","4","Upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving Clarence's life, Joe reluctantly agrees to help Clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life."
"454","tt0037514","4466","5","They are drafted by a policeman Rags Ragland, who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy Dean Stockwell who wants to join the Navy into returning home to ""Aunt Susan"" Grayson."
"455","tt0037514","4466","6","At first it is Clarence who is interested in wooing ""Aunt Susan"" but eventually Kelly's character emerges as the more likely candidate."
"456","tt0037514","4466","7","There are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to Kelly's more famous work in films like ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""American in Paris""."
"457","tt0037514","4466","8","The closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with Kelly's character in a fantasy sequence dancing with Jerry, the mouse from ""Tom and Jerry"" although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse."
"458","tt0037514","4466","9","It's a startling sequence for its time but doesn't have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time."
"459","tt0037514","4466","10","I actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation, where Kelly was using semi balletic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of ""Alice in Wonderland""."
"460","tt0037514","4466","11","Eventually the characters find their way to Susan's favorite bar, a somewhat sanitized Mexican restaurant/bar in Tijuana."
"461","tt0037514","4466","12","There the patrons happily allow Ms."
"462","tt0037514","4466","13","Grayson to chirp her arias with abandon, and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that Clarence and Joe have extended for her to sing with their ""friend"" Jose Iturbi playing himself with a light humorous touch."
"463","tt0037514","4466","14","Of course they've never met their ""friend"" Iturbi and they spend much of the film's length trying to reach him in an amusing scene Sinatra's character meets Iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career, sneaking into the studio and the Hollywood Bowl, where Iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players  you haven't seen anything like this outside of ""1000 Fingers of Dr."
"464","tt0037514","4466","15","T""."
"465","tt0037514","4466","16","Iturbi himself is a kind of a god figure in the story  he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine."
"466","tt0037514","4466","17","Everyone is 100% sure that as soon as Mr."
"467","tt0037514","4466","18","Iturbi so much as hears Ms."
"468","tt0037514","4466","19","Grayson, her operatic career will be a reality."
"469","tt0037514","4466","20","The 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure  a lot of the film's charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very down to earth ""real"" mannerisms of the maestro."
"470","tt0037514","4466","21","And speaking of Iturbi's contributions to the film, he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of ""Donkey Serenade""."
"471","tt0037514","4466","22","When all is said and done, this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss."
"472","tt0037514","4466","23","The majority of the music was written for this film, a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other Kelly opuses like ""Rain"" and ""American""."
"473","tt0037514","4466","24","Kelly is still at his early peak, adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character."
"474","tt0037514","4466","25","Sinatra's voice was never in better form and he rarely had better songs to sing."
"475","tt0037514","4466","26","Stockwell is a charming addition to the clan, and Grayson's character is endearing when she isn't posturing on stage."
"476","tt0037514","4466","27","Iturbi adds that well grounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classic era MGM musical."
"477","tt0037514","4466","28","This is one of the better ones."
"478","tt0037514","4467","1","Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson."
"479","tt0037514","4467","2","The film won and Oscar for George E."
"480","tt0037514","4467","3","Stoll's score, and it garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Son nomination for ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" sung by Sinatra."
"481","tt0037514","4467","4","It was a cute story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself."
"482","tt0037514","4467","5","The lovely Grayson The Toast of New Orleans dazzled us with her singing, and we had a lot of great songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the artistry of pianist conductor José Iturbi."
"483","tt0037514","4467","6","A classic Hollywood music from an era gone by."
"484","tt0037514","4468","1","Two sailors are on leave ladies man Joseph Brady Gene Kelly and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle Frank Sinatra."
"485","tt0037514","4468","2","They meet beautiful Susan Abbott Kathryn Grayson and both fall in love with her."
"486","tt0037514","4468","3","There's more but you've probably guessed it."
"487","tt0037514","4468","4","The story even for a 1940s musical is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome gets annoying pretty quick."
"488","tt0037514","4468","5","Also this movie is far too long."
"489","tt0037514","4468","6","It's 140 minutes and that's way too much for such a silly story."
"490","tt0037514","4468","7","There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra."
"491","tt0037514","4468","8","Still this is worth catching."
"492","tt0037514","4468","9","When Kelly is dancing or Sinatra or Grayson are singing this becomes magical."
"493","tt0037514","4468","10","None of the songs are particularly memorable but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won't care."
"494","tt0037514","4468","11","It's shot in rich Technicolor with all the gloss MGM had."
"495","tt0037514","4468","12","The acting is OK Kelly is fine although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it and Sinatra is just great although seeing HIM as a shy guy was pushing it too!."
"496","tt0037514","4468","13","Grayson is given nothing to do but she's incredibly beautiful to look at."
"497","tt0037514","4468","14","Some shots of her literally took my breath away!"
"498","tt0037514","4468","15","There are plenty of highlights here: Sinatra and Kelly's big dancing and singing number; Sinatra singing anything; Grayson's two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry an animated mouse!"
"499","tt0037514","4468","16","Tom does a funny cameo too."
"500","tt0037514","4468","17","Also there's little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he's in."
"501","tt0037514","4468","18","So it's too long and the plot just doesn't hold up but it's still worth catching."
"502","tt0037514","4468","19","This was a huge hit in its day."
"503","tt0037514","4469","1","Usually musicals in the 1940's were of a set formula and if you studied films you know what I'm talking about a certain running lenghth, very ""showy"" performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc."
"504","tt0037514","4469","2","THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT and light years better and well worth it's nomination for best picture of the year 1945 although had no chance of beating the eventual winner Lost Weekend."
"505","tt0037514","4469","3","Gene Kelly was probably in the best form of his career yes I know about ""American in Paris"" and ""Singing in the Rain""."
"506","tt0037514","4469","4","This one is different."
"507","tt0037514","4469","5","He really gets into his character of a ""sea wolf"" thinking at first that ""picking up any girl while on leave"" is nothing more than a lark."
"508","tt0037514","4469","6","And if you had to make up a ""story"" to get her so be it until."
"509","tt0037514","4469","7","Sort of like the Music Man when he gets ""his foot caught in the door""."
"510","tt0037514","4469","8","The eventual hilarity of the film stems mostly from his and his new pal Sinatra's attempt to make the ""story"" good in order to ""get the girl"" that he REALLY and unexpectedly falls in love with."
"511","tt0037514","4469","9","You are going to have to see the movie to see what I mean."
"512","tt0037514","4469","10","Besides that there are so many other elements of great film in this one, it's a classic buddy story, nostalgia to a time when WWII was almost over the war ended about a month after the films release, a realization that a guy that always laughed at life can find out that he really is a great human being, great songs and probably a few other elements of classic film making that I can't think of right now."
"513","tt0037514","4469","11","Why not a 10."
"514","tt0037514","4469","12","Near the end at nearly 2 1/2 hours starts to feel a bit long."
"515","tt0037514","4469","13","There is a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now."
"516","tt0037514","4469","14","But overall, this ones a definite winner on every level."
"517","tt0037514","4470","1","Similar to ""On the Town,"" this musical about sailors on shore leave falls short of the later classic in terms of pacing and the quality of the songs, but it has its own charms."
"518","tt0037514","4470","2","Kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with Jerry the cartoon mouse of ""Tom and Jerry"" fame, one with a little girl, and a fantasy sequence where he is a Spanish lover determined to reach his lady on a high balcony."
"519","tt0037514","4470","3","Sinatra, playing Kelly's shy, inexperienced buddy, and Grayson, the woman who serves as the love interest for both men, do most of the singing."
"520","tt0037514","4470","4","Iturbi provides some fine piano playing."
"521","tt0037514","4470","5","At nearly two and half hours, it is a bit too long for a light musical but it doesn't drag."
"522","tt0037514","4471","1","Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, and Jose Iturbi star in ""Anchors Aweigh,"" directed by George Sidney."
"523","tt0037514","4471","2","Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two navy guys on leave in Hollywood."
"524","tt0037514","4471","3","They meet a little boy Dean Stockwell and on taking him home, they meet his aunt Grayson."
"525","tt0037514","4471","4","Clarence falls for her."
"526","tt0037514","4471","5","She wants an audition for Jose Iturbi."
"527","tt0037514","4471","6","They try to help, but there's a mix up."
"528","tt0037514","4471","7","This is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra."
"529","tt0037514","4471","8","Kelly gets to dance with Jerry the Mouse in a delightful sequence."
"530","tt0037514","4471","9","Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings."
"531","tt0037514","4471","10","Not one of my favorite voices, but she does well."
"532","tt0037514","4471","11","Iturbi's piano work is beautiful."
"533","tt0037514","4471","12","Sinatra gets to show his versatility and why the girls swooned over him, with those big blue eyes and boyish face."
"534","tt0037514","4471","13","For Kelly, this was a major break for him at MGM.Wonderful movie, very buoyant."
"535","tt0037514","4472","1","Right from the start you see that ""Anchors Aweigh"" is a great comedy."
"536","tt0037514","4472","2","Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team!"
"537","tt0037514","4472","3","The songs they sing together are pure entertainment."
"538","tt0037514","4472","4","Kathryn Grayson is gorgeous and really sweet."
"539","tt0037514","4472","5","Dean Stockwell is the cutiest child actor I've never seen."
"540","tt0037514","4472","6","If you are fond of piano, you'll be amazed by José Iturbi."
"541","tt0037514","4472","7","This movie was the first one to combine animation with real actors and it did that wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number."
"542","tt0037514","4472","8","Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest movies."
"543","tt0037514","4473","1","Although in my opinion this is one of the lesser musicals of stars Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly, Kathryn Grayson and director George Sidney, a lesser musical featuring anyone from that line up is nothing to sneeze at, and in conjunction, the line up makes Anchors Aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws."
"544","tt0037514","4473","2","Sinatra and Kelly are Clarence Doolittle and Joseph Brady, respectively, two Navy men."
"545","tt0037514","4473","3","As the film begins, they're just pulling in to the Los Angeles area for some much needed leave."
"546","tt0037514","4473","4","Brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named Lola."
"547","tt0037514","4473","5","Doolittle is still a bit wet behind the ears, appropriately enough, and seeks advice on women from Brady in private publicly, scriptwriter Isobel Lennart and Sidney have all of the Navy men comically exaggerating their finesse with women to each other."
"548","tt0037514","4473","6","Brady promises to help get Doolittle hooked up, but primarily because Doolittle won't leave him alone otherwise."
"549","tt0037514","4473","7","A kink is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the Navy."
"550","tt0037514","4473","8","He won't give the police any information about who he is or where he lives."
"551","tt0037514","4473","9","Brady helps and he and Doolittle end up taking the boy back home."
"552","tt0037514","4473","10","When the boy's guardian, Susan Abbott Grayson, finally shows up, Doolittle goes gaga for her."
"553","tt0037514","4473","11","Brady tries to convince him to forget about her; Brady just wants to get back to Lola."
"554","tt0037514","4473","12","But they keep getting coaxed back to Abbott's home, and eventually something of a love triangle forms."
"555","tt0037514","4473","13","Things become more complicated when Brady lies about Doolittle knowing a famous musician, Jose Iturbi, who is in residence at a film studio, and claims that Doolittle has set up an audition for Abbott, who is a singer and actress, in front of Iturbi."
"556","tt0037514","4473","14","Because of the story, the music is a strange combination of militaristic music because of the Navy premise, obviously, Broadway pop what the stars tend to sing in more informal settings, opera what Abbott's character excels at, Liberace like popular classical what Iturbi did, and Mexican music because Abbott frequents a Mexican restaurant in a Mexican section of L.A."
"557","tt0037514","4473","15","The combination doesn't work as well as it could."
"558","tt0037514","4473","16","Plenty of the songs are good, and everyone involved is certainly talented as a singer or musician, but the genre hopping tends to lose coherence."
"559","tt0037514","4473","17","Worse, there are a couple showcases for Iturbi, who was apparently a big star at the time, that effectively bring the plot to a halt and that seem more than a bit hokey at this point in time."
"560","tt0037514","4473","18","I just watched another film that happened to have outstanding music, Robert Altman's Kansas City 1996, but that misguidedly stopped the plot to periodically turn into a concert film."
"561","tt0037514","4473","19","Anchors Aweigh takes a similar tactic."
"562","tt0037514","4473","20","Yes, this is a musical, but there's a difference between songs that propel and are integral to the plot and concert showcases that seem like contractual obligation material."
"563","tt0037514","4473","21","There are also some plot problems."
"564","tt0037514","4473","22","It's not very well established why Brady is so against Doolittle's pursuit of Abbott."
"565","tt0037514","4473","23","We can guess that Brady thinks Doolittle shouldn't become involved with someone who has to take care of a kid, and who seems relatively ""proper"" and traditional, but on the other hand, Brady can tell that Doolittle doesn't have the same womanizing disposition that Brady admits of himself."
"566","tt0037514","4473","24","Abbott seems like a good fit for Doolittle, and furthermore, Lennart works hard to establish that Brady just wants to get Doolittle out of his hair and get on with meeting Lola it seems that Brady's character should be quickly pawning Doolittle off on any candidate, whether she's a good fit or not."
"567","tt0037514","4473","25","This might seem like a minor detail, but it's actually the hinge for about a third to half of the plot."
"568","tt0037514","4473","26","The story also seems a bit drawn out."
"569","tt0037514","4473","27","Length is a problem."
"570","tt0037514","4473","28","Anchors Aweigh, clocking in at roughly two hours and twenty minutes, should have been cut down by at least a half hour."
"571","tt0037514","4473","29","The above surely sounds like I'm complaining about the film too much to justify an 8."
"572","tt0037514","4473","30","I just wanted to stress what I see as flaws, because the conventional wisdom on Anchors Aweigh is much closer to the idea that it has no flaws."
"573","tt0037514","4473","31","Sinatra, Kelly and Grayson are certainly charismatic, separately and together."
"574","tt0037514","4473","32","They turn in good, interesting performances."
"575","tt0037514","4473","33","Sinatra looks and acts much younger than his actual age of 29  30 while shooting."
"576","tt0037514","4473","34","He plays an unusually naïve, virginal character completely different than most of the roles he would take later, and different than his public image as a crooner."
"577","tt0037514","4473","35","For Kelly, this was his breakthrough film, and rightfully so."
"578","tt0037514","4473","36","His choreography is varied and impressive, as is his acting."
"579","tt0037514","4473","37","Grayson is charming, her performance is sophisticatedly understated, and she's simply gorgeous."
"580","tt0037514","4473","38","All of this helps override the flaws with the script and the drawn out pacing."
"581","tt0037514","4473","39","And there's even a very interesting element that probably only arises because Sidney was allowed to sprawl over a large variety of moods the infamous Kelly dance with Jerry the Mouse of ""Tom and Jerry"" fame in an extended fantasy sequence."
"582","tt0037514","4473","40","This is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation, and it is extremely well done and enjoyable as long as you're a fan of fantasy."
"583","tt0037514","4473","41","The fantasy sequences tend to be the best of the film."
"584","tt0037514","4473","42","Matched in excellence to the dance with Jerry the Mouse is a long song and dance number featuring Kelly and Grayson, where Brady is imagining Abbott in a scene from a period film while he woos her, having to resort to acrobatic stunts to reach her physically as she stands on a high balcony."
"585","tt0037514","4473","43","As uneven and flawed as the film is, it is largely successful and entertaining to watch."
"586","tt0037514","4473","44","Fans of classic musicals certainly shouldn't miss Anchors Aweigh, and neither should Sinatra fans, who'll get quite a kick out of his character."
"587","tt0037514","4474","1","This film like Astaire's ROYAL WEDDING which was shown after it on Turner Classic Network last night is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in Gene Kelly's record: Like Fred Astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a room's walls and ceiling, this film had Gene Kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with Jerry Mouse."
"588","tt0037514","4474","2","The sequence is nicely done."
"589","tt0037514","4474","3","What is forgotten is that Kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to Dean Stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day, and sets the stage for the sequence by having Stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background."
"590","tt0037514","4474","4","Kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white ""Pomeranian"" navy uniform with blue stripes on it."
"591","tt0037514","4474","5","Jerry Mouse does more than dance with Gene."
"592","tt0037514","4474","6","He actually talks a first that he did not repeat for many decades."
"593","tt0037514","4474","7","He also finally puts Tom Cat into his proper place Tom briefly appears as King Jerry's butler, trying to cheer him with a platter of cheeses."
"594","tt0037514","4474","8","But the sequence of the cartoon with Kelly took about seven minutes of the movie."
"595","tt0037514","4474","9","Far more of this peculiar film is taken up with Kelly's story of the lost four day furlough in Hollywood, and how Kelly ends up meeting Katherine Grayson and with Frank Sinatra stalking Jose Iturbi at the MGM film studio, the Hollywood Bowl, and Iturbi's own home."
"596","tt0037514","4474","10","Except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbing."
"597","tt0037514","4474","11","Kelly has saved Sinatra's life in the Pacific, and is getting a medal as a result."
"598","tt0037514","4474","12","They are both among the crewmen back in California who are getting a four day leave."
"599","tt0037514","4474","13","But the script writers to propel what would be a short film Kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one ""Lola"", an unseen good time girl in Hollywood saddle Gene with Frank."
"600","tt0037514","4474","14","It seems Frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie factories particularly musical comedies who are socially underdeveloped and in need of ""instruction"" about meeting girls or guys if the characters are women."
"601","tt0037514","4474","15","Frank insists that Gene help ""teach him"" how to get a girl."
"602","tt0037514","4474","16","Just then a policeman takes them to headquarters to help the cops with a little boy Stockwell who insists on joining the navy and won't give the cops his real name and address."
"603","tt0037514","4474","17","When a protesting Kelly is able to get this information out of Stockwell by asking him some straight questions which the cops could not ask, they insist Kelly take the boy home to his aunt Grayson."
"604","tt0037514","4474","18","Still protesting, Kelly gets saddled with increasingly complicated problems mostly due to Sinatra's simplistic soul view of things."
"605","tt0037514","4474","19","He misses seeing Lola the next day by sleeping late Sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up."
"606","tt0037514","4474","20","He keeps getting dragged back to Grayson's house, as Sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself, but needs Kelly to train him in love making."
"607","tt0037514","4474","21","I suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of ANCHORS AWEIGH, but I find this kind of story irritating."
"608","tt0037514","4474","22","While the singing and dancing and concert music of Kelly, Sinatra, Grayson, and Iturbi are first rate, it is annoying to have to take the idiocies of someone like Sinatra's character seriously."
"609","tt0037514","4474","23","In the real world Kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day furlough what right has he to insist as Sinatra does that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date."
"610","tt0037514","4474","24","That kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsense."
"611","tt0037514","4474","25","The stalking of Iturbi is likewise annoying."
"612","tt0037514","4474","26","Kelly tries to get Grayson to like Sinatra when he says Sinatra can get her a meeting with Jose Iturbi to audition her singing ability."
"613","tt0037514","4474","27","For much of the rest of the picture Sinatra and Kelly try to do that, and keep floundering at one point for no really good reason Grayson herself ruins Kelly's attempt to get an interview at MGM with Iturbi."
"614","tt0037514","4474","28","It is only sheer luck that Iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed Grayson that she does give him an audition of her talent."
"615","tt0037514","4474","29","Kelly, by the way, ends up with Grayson."
"616","tt0037514","4474","30","Sinatra's conscience at not being able to help her see Iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her but not pulling Kelly into it, oddly enough and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress Pamela Britton from his native Brooklyn."
"617","tt0037514","4474","31","And naturally, without any assistance from Kelly, Sinatra and Britton fall in love."
"618","tt0037514","4474","32","Ah,""consistency""!"
"619","tt0037514","4474","33","Thy name is not ""screenwriting"" necessarily!"
"620","tt0037514","4475","1","The United States was still fighting World War II the movie was released in between VE day and VJ day."
"621","tt0037514","4475","2","Any studio worth its salt was either making fighting movies where fearless American soldiers beat the enemy, or Americans in general were singing and dancing."
"622","tt0037514","4475","3","Technicolor Musicals were what America thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed."
"623","tt0037514","4475","4","Most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time til the next musical number!"
"624","tt0037514","4475","5","I get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970."
"625","tt0037514","4475","6","Depressing how quickly we forget."
"626","tt0037514","4475","7","This film could've been called ""The Search for Jose Iturbi"" but now everyone wonders why."
"627","tt0037514","4475","8","Allow me to explain."
"628","tt0037514","4475","9","From 1929 his arrival in America until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the finest pianists to grace a concert stage."
"629","tt0037514","4475","10","He agreed to do a few movies in 1942, but Hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time."
"630","tt0037514","4475","11","Not only an excellent pianist, but a successful conductor as well, Iturbi was very much a household word for more than 40 years."
"631","tt0037514","4475","12","The scene where Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies was planned early on and hasn't anyone ever noticed the other pianists were all children."
"632","tt0037514","4475","13","Joe Pasternak, who produced that movie & many other MGM musicals, credited Iturbi with interesting America's youth in classical music."
"633","tt0037514","4475","14","Grayson's wanting an audition with Iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time."
"634","tt0037514","4475","15","Everyone wanted Iturbi back then."
"635","tt0037514","4475","16","The joke among soldiers was that ""GI"" meant ""Get Iturbi"" he did a lot of concerts at military bases."
"636","tt0037514","4475","17","Gene Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra an excellent singer, but at the time this movie was made Sinatra was barely 30 and had only been under contract to Columbia Records for four years."
"637","tt0037514","4475","18","Kelly was already well known as a dancer, but Iturbi had by then been a world wide sensation for 20+ years."
"638","tt0037514","4475","19","And as to the lack of a plot, Americans didn't need plot."
"639","tt0037514","4475","20","They were tired of war, they were sick with fear for their loved ones, and worried about the future."
"640","tt0037514","4475","21","They needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out fine in the end."
"641","tt0037514","4475","22","They needed music and smiles and joy and romance."
"642","tt0037514","4475","23","This movie and others like it delivered just what was needed."
"643","tt0037514","4475","24","Enough lecturing."
"644","tt0037514","4475","25","Mouse dancing aside, the best scene in the movie occurs between Sinatra and Iturbi with each of them ""ignorantly"" complimenting the other's music."
"645","tt0037514","4475","26","If you have any interest in Jose Iturbi, the Spaniard who conquered more of America than De Soto, Cortez, and De Leon put together, please drop by my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find a plot summary, excerpts from movie reviews ""of the day"" and pictures from this and certain other MGM musicals of the 1940's, as well as a biography and discography of Iturbi."

"673","tt0037514","4476","27","The most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world, and there Gene sings and dances with Jerry Mouse."
"674","tt0037514","4476","28","Also Tom Cat is seen there as the butler."
"675","tt0037514","4476","29","They originally asked Mickey Mouse but he refused."
"676","tt0037514","4476","30","The movie was nominated for five Oscars but Georgie Stoll got one for Original Music Score."
"677","tt0037514","4476","31","Anchors Aweigh is some high class entertainment."
"678","tt0037514","4477","1","This one has a lot going for it Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten and a lesser amount of dross Iturbi, Grayson plus a little ho hum Kelly."
"679","tt0037514","4477","2","It was Sinatra's first real movie where the producer's spent a buck and you could see it on screen previously he'd appeared in two low budgeters, Higher And Higher and Step Lively but if they'd only relied on the Sinatra pipes and deep sixed Grayson's plus Iturbi's ego tripping piano spots we'd have been left with a much tighter movie and a better showcase for Sinatra."
"680","tt0037514","4477","3","As it is he scores heavily in all his songs from the two duets with Kelly We Hate To Leave, I Begged Her to his own solos, What Makes The Sunset, The Charm Of You and I Fall In Love Too Easily."
"681","tt0037514","4477","4","Despite this Step Lively remains the best Sinatra musical of the forties on one tenth the budget."
"682","tt0037514","4478","1","Overall this is a delightful, light hearted, romantic, musical comedy."
"683","tt0037514","4478","2","I suppose a small case could be made for the movie being to long."
"684","tt0037514","4478","3","But I'm not sure what you would cut out."
"685","tt0037514","4478","4","The singing that Kelly and Sinatra do."
"686","tt0037514","4478","5","No."
"687","tt0037514","4478","6","The fabulous dancing that Kelly does."
"688","tt0037514","4478","7","No."
"689","tt0037514","4478","8","The time the movie takes to develop the story line and develop the relationships of the characters."
"690","tt0037514","4478","9","No that seems to be a common complaint many times that more recent movies don't develop the characters."
"691","tt0037514","4478","10","Some comment that Iturbi didn't bring much to the movie but this gives us a chance to see and hear a great talent from the 1040s."
"692","tt0037514","4478","11","So what if he wasn't an actor."
"693","tt0037514","4478","12","He was an important part of the movie as the basic plot was to get Grayson an audition with him."
"694","tt0037514","4478","13","Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star."
"695","tt0037514","4478","14","Louis B."
"696","tt0037514","4478","15","Mayer brought her to MGM for a screen test that included an aria."
"697","tt0037514","4478","16","During her audition in the movie there is a shot of the MGM brass nodding and smiling."
"698","tt0037514","4478","17","You can just imagine it was like that when she had made her real screen test years before."
"699","tt0037514","4478","18","This movie is so full of life it is hard to hit all of the highlights."
"700","tt0037514","4478","19","Great use was made of color and lighting throughout the movie."
"701","tt0037514","4478","20","You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did."
"702","tt0037514","4478","21","A nice counter point in the movie is how Sinatra a ladies man even then played the role of wanting to just find a date while on leave."
"703","tt0037514","4478","22","You'll feel good after seeing this movie."
"704","tt0037514","4478","23","7/10"
"705","tt0037514","4479","1","Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me."
"706","tt0037514","4479","2","At age 15, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals."
"707","tt0037514","4479","3","Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players."
"708","tt0037514","4479","4","Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance."
"709","tt0037514","4479","5","As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm up for On the Town."
"710","tt0037514","4479","6","Sinatra may have had to work hard at it, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and he would do better in their next pairings."
"711","tt0037514","4479","7","However, observing his physique, it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean."
"712","tt0037514","4479","8","Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat."
"713","tt0037514","4479","9","Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire."
"714","tt0037514","4479","10","Finally, it was strange to see the fresh faced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a ""thrill"" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold Loeb murder from the 1920s."
"715","tt0037514","4479","11","An additional note: One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest."
"716","tt0037514","4479","12","She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film."
"717","tt0037514","4480","1","In the Citadel film series book The Films of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical."
"718","tt0037514","4480","2","I sure can't do better than that."
"719","tt0037514","4480","3","It's such an important film in both the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra."
"720","tt0037514","4480","4","Kathryn Grayson didn't do too badly with this either."
"721","tt0037514","4480","5","Louis B."
"722","tt0037514","4480","6","Mayer had lent Gene Kelly out to Columbia where Harry Cohn had an inspiration to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it, Cover Girl became a classic."
"723","tt0037514","4480","7","So if Mayer didn't learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly artistic control."
"724","tt0037514","4480","8","When Anchors Aweigh was finished, Fred Astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance."
"725","tt0037514","4480","9","The main number everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse."
"726","tt0037514","4480","10","Originally Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney wasn't lending Mickey out to nobody."
"727","tt0037514","4480","11","Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit to do an outside film."
"728","tt0037514","4480","12","Not to worry because MGM had it's own animated rodent one half the team of Tom and Jerry."
"729","tt0037514","4480","13","Kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did Fred Astaire."
"730","tt0037514","4480","14","For the next dozen years, these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves weren't up to snuff."
"731","tt0037514","4480","15","It was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios."
"732","tt0037514","4480","16","In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit."
"733","tt0037514","4480","17","In fact Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning him is Oscar for From Here to Eternity."
"734","tt0037514","4480","18","When Frank Sinatra had half of his contract bought from RKO by MGM he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own."
"735","tt0037514","4480","19","He'd become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn."
"736","tt0037514","4480","20","In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells about how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film."
"737","tt0037514","4480","21","Louis B."
"738","tt0037514","4480","22","Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing."
"739","tt0037514","4480","23","One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I Fall in Love Too Easily."
"740","tt0037514","4480","24","Frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty Hollywood Bowl."
"741","tt0037514","4480","25","It's Sinatra at his best."
"742","tt0037514","4480","26","With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth than any other person."
"743","tt0037514","4480","27","They were lifetime friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone boost in his career."
"744","tt0037514","4480","28","On a bet Styne and Cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale."
"745","tt0037514","4480","29","They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings."
"746","tt0037514","4480","30","She also did some classical numbers."
"747","tt0037514","4480","31","Here singing in fact is the basis of the plot."
"748","tt0037514","4480","32","Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell."
"749","tt0037514","4480","33","Trying to fix her up with Sinatra, Kelly says he can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi."
"750","tt0037514","4480","34","They spend the film trying to accomplish just that."
"751","tt0037514","4480","35","My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays the waitress 'Brooklyn' never got a number herself."
"752","tt0037514","4480","36","She had gotten rave reviews from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood."
"753","tt0037514","4480","37","I have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in MGM's vaults it might still be."
"754","tt0037514","4480","38","Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals just aren't made any more."
"755","tt0037514","4480","39","All that creative talent was under contract to Metro Goldwyn Mayer."
"756","tt0037514","4480","40","If you had to pay market value for it, the cost might retire some third world country's debt."
"757","tt0037514","4480","41","But the film results would be extraordinary."
"758","tt0037514","4481","1","The only reason I give this movie 8/10 stars, and not 10, is because 1 Sinatra is awful and 2 the love interest of Kelly's character leaves much to be desired, IMHO."
"759","tt0037514","4481","2","Do love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap Al, is the little boy."
"760","tt0037514","4481","3","The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I have ever seen."
"761","tt0037514","4481","4","Tom and Jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter's."
"762","tt0037514","4481","5","I'm 28 and she's 4, so while the character is less iconic than Mickey, he is still a favorite of many children and adults today."
"763","tt0037514","4481","6","Kelly is as always captivating, his eyes full of fun and excitement."
"764","tt0037514","4481","7","In every movie I have ever seen him in, he always steals the show."
"765","tt0037514","4481","8","One of the best dancers of the 20th century."
"766","tt0037514","4481","9","It is no wonder Paula Abdul ""sampled"" Kelly's moves."
"767","tt0037514","4481","10","I would also list Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century."
"768","tt0037514","4481","11","If you were to watch only one part, don't miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse."
"769","tt0037514","4481","12","You will NOT be disappointed."
"770","tt0037514","4482","1","ANCHORS AWEIGH sees two eager young sailors, Joe Brady Gene Kelly and Clarence Doolittle/Brooklyn Frank Sinatra, get a special four day shore leave."
"771","tt0037514","4482","2","Eager to get to the girls, particularly Joe's Lola, neither Joe nor Brooklyn figure on the interruption of little Navy mad Donald Dean Stockwell and his Aunt Susie Kathryn Grayson."
"772","tt0037514","4482","3","Unexperienced in the ways of females and courting, Brooklyn quickly enlists Joe to help him win Aunt Susie over."
"773","tt0037514","4482","4","Along the way, however, Joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend."
"774","tt0037514","4482","5","How is Brooklyn going to take this betrayal."
"775","tt0037514","4482","6","And does Joe end up with Susie, who loves him too."
"776","tt0037514","4482","7","The first and second times I saw ANCHORS AWEIGH, I also saw it at the same time as I did ON THE TOWN, the Kelly/Sinatra collaboration from 1949."
"777","tt0037514","4482","8","Both times I felt that ANCHORS AWEIGH was the better film in terms of plotting and structure all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot, and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them."
"778","tt0037514","4482","9","Yet, both times I came away feeling that ON THE TOWN is the better film overall."
"779","tt0037514","4482","10","Having now seen both films a third time, I still stand by that judgement."
"780","tt0037514","4482","11","Somehow ON THE TOWN, as a film and a piece of entertainment, is just lighter, gayer, purely and simply happier."
"781","tt0037514","4482","12","The numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot, and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in ANCHORS AWEIGH."
"782","tt0037514","4482","13","I'm not quite sure why this is."
"783","tt0037514","4482","14","The typical argument is that the latter film is over long: at almost two and a half hours, this is certainly a valid criticism to make."
"784","tt0037514","4482","15","I certainly felt the length the first two times I saw it!"
"785","tt0037514","4482","16","However, it's also a film that grows on you the more you see it, the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making."
"786","tt0037514","4482","17","And yet, something just doesn't hang together quite right."
"787","tt0037514","4482","18","It feels almost as if the script was pored over, and every single moment when Kelly could break into dance or Sinatra into song was noted, and that's exactly what happened."
"788","tt0037514","4482","19","No opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up... and that's probably the film's biggest weakness."
"789","tt0037514","4482","20","It has 16 numbers give or take a few, and no matter how big a fan you are of Kelly or Sinatra, this really starts to turn one numb after a while."
"790","tt0037514","4482","21","Contrast this, for example, with the ten numbers in ON THE TOWN."
"791","tt0037514","4482","22","You might well feel that each song, each dance, can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking... and that's true."
"792","tt0037514","4482","23","But that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place."
"793","tt0037514","4482","24","All this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about ANCHORS AWEIGH."
"794","tt0037514","4482","25","The musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over, like the duets between Kelly and Sinatra 'We Hate To Leave', 'I Begged Her' and 'If You Knew Susie', the singing of Sinatra 'What Makes The Sunset', 'The Charm Of You', and the best of all, 'I Fall In Love Too Easily', and without a doubt the always inventive, always breathtaking dancing of Kelly."
"795","tt0037514","4482","26","It's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre."
"796","tt0037514","4482","27","Grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening; Jose Iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it; even Clarence's own Brooklyn, Pamela Britton, is cute and charming... as close as one could get to Betty Garrett without being Garrett herself!"
"797","tt0037514","4482","28","Sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his, and plays the innocent boy man wonderfully a role he reprises in ON THE TOWN."
"798","tt0037514","4482","29","His singing is, as usual, simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing."
"799","tt0037514","4482","30","His solo numbers might seem to drag a little, but when you've got the voice of a century, showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film!"
"800","tt0037514","4482","31","Gene Kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph."
"801","tt0037514","4482","32","Third in the billing behind Sinatra and Grayson respectively, ANCHORS AWEIGH really is Kelly's film."
"802","tt0037514","4482","33","His Joe Brady is a believable, real character he's tough on the outside, glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal, but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside."
"803","tt0037514","4482","34","Kelly makes this charming rather than cloying, but also gives Joe a real edge that you see in the scene when Joe chases Brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands."
"804","tt0037514","4482","35","And the dancing again, the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome, as it does with Sinatra's singing."
"805","tt0037514","4482","36","But once again, if it's Gene Kelly doing the softshoe, or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief... might as well err on the side of overdoing it!"
"806","tt0037514","4482","37","All of Kelly's dances are breathtaking, be it the pared down simplicity of his tap number with Sinatra to 'I Begged Her', his 'Mexican Hat Dance' with the sweet wide eyed little girl, or his lavish Spanish influenced dance 'La Cumparsita'."
"807","tt0037514","4482","38","Of course, the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be Kelly in his red, white and blue sailor suit, dancing with Jerry Mouse of 'Tom & Jerry' fame."
"808","tt0037514","4482","39","A well deserved golden film memory, to be sure it's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945, given the saturation of CGI in the contemporary film market."
"809","tt0037514","4482","40","But Gene and Jerry still look great, with Kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look."
"810","tt0037514","4482","41","It would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with Gene Kelly would be Kelly himself in COVER GIRL and a cartoon animation."
"811","tt0037514","4482","42","It's doubtless that this first daring, inventive Kelly dance with Jerry has reserved a place for ANCHORS AWEIGH in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs."
"812","tt0037514","4482","43","But it's also notable for being the first of three Kelly/Sinatra film collaborations, and though rather too drawn out, still a great couple of hours of entertainment."
"813","tt0037514","4482","44","Watch it first, then again and maybe again it'll grow on you before you realise it!"
"814","tt0037514","4482","45","7.5/10"
"815","tt0037514","4483","1","Everything a musical comedy should be."
"816","tt0037514","4483","2","Gene Kelly as Joe Brady doesn't miss a step, and Frank Sinatra as Clarence Doolittle doesn't miss a note."
"817","tt0037514","4483","3","Scenes with them together are very good, showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot."
"818","tt0037514","4483","4","Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future best."
"819","tt0037514","4483","5","Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is delightful."
"820","tt0037514","4483","6","Kelly certainly earned his nomination as Best Actor."
"821","tt0037514","4483","7","And there is a bushel of truly funny lines, like: ""You think the navy takes dopes."""
"822","tt0037514","4483","8","; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep.""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."""
"823","tt0037514","4483","9","A thoroughly enjoyable movie, just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded World War II."
"824","tt0037514","4484","1","Released some months before the end of the war, ""Anchors Aweigh"" is one of Gene Kelly's major musical triumphs of the forties Under the direction of George Sidney, it had the benefits of a pleasant score, andbest of allthe services of Gene Kelly in his first true starring role at MGM The year before, in Columbia's ""Cover Girl,"" he had revealed an innovative approach to dance on the screen, a light but agreeable singing voice, and considerable charm In ""Anchors Aweigh,"" although he was billed under Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson, he was laying the solid groundwork for his most revealing years at MGM The film's story, a kind of dry run for ""On the Town"" four years later, follows sailors Kelly and Sinatra on shore leave, spend their holiday in Hollywood, where they become involved in the affairs of an aspiring singer Grayson and her little nephew Dean Stockwell."
"825","tt0037514","4484","2","Grayson, it appears, has her heart set on an audition with conductor pianist Jose Iturbi She gets the audition, of course; Kelly gets Grayson after some misunderstandings; and Sinatra, has forgotten to be shy, and has lost his heart to a girl from Brooklyn Pamela Britton."
"826","tt0037514","4484","3","The plot is conventional for the period but, regrettably, it now seems barely tolerable But there is Gene Kelly, who dominates the movie with his agreeable personality Perhaps he grins too much, but when is permitted to dance, the film finally lifts off the ground ""I Begged Her,"" his early song and dance with Sinatra, is amusing and slightly absurd, in which he imagines himself as a bandit chieftain in a Spanish courtyard, courting maiden Grayson with a flamboyant flamenco dance and some athletic leaps He also does a charming Mexican dance with little Sharon McManus in the square of a Mexican settlement in Los Angeles The highlight of the movie, however, is Kelly's famous dance with the cartoon character Jerry the Mouse of ""Tom and Jerry"" fame."
"827","tt0037514","4484","4","Delightful and innovative, it skillfully combines live action and animation in its tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until Kelly, a sailor in the ""Pomeranian Navy,"" wearing a striped shirt and a beret, shows him how to dance ""Look at me, I'm dancin'!"""
"828","tt0037514","4484","5","says the gleeful mouse king..."
"829","tt0040613","1076","1","Super slick entertainment with a stellar cast, an outstanding script, and a firm grip on the approaching 1950's."
"830","tt0040613","1076","2","At the time, RKO was turning out classic noirs by the dozens."
"831","tt0040613","1076","3","But whatever the value of those shadowy downers, they reflected a war time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the Eisenhower era."
"832","tt0040613","1076","4","Few films of the late 40's are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy."
"833","tt0040613","1076","5","Jim Blandings Cary Grant works as an ad man on Madison Ave. where in his little daughter's words he sells things to people that they don't need, at prices they can't afford."
"834","tt0040613","1076","6","He's making good money, but like thousands of others, he's tired of living in a cramped urban ""cave""."
"835","tt0040613","1076","7","So, with wife Myrnah Loy, they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the Connecticutt countryside."
"836","tt0040613","1076","8","Needless to say, in the arms of nature, they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion."
"837","tt0040613","1076","9","There's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script."
"838","tt0040613","1076","10","I don't know if writers Panama and Frank got an Oscar, but they should have."
"839","tt0040613","1076","11","Of course, the humor revolves around all the problems that pop up when city people build a big house on rural land."
"840","tt0040613","1076","12","The annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage, with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving Grant a hard time."
"841","tt0040613","1076","13","Of course, no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than Grant, so it's just one well placed laugh after another, particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own."
"842","tt0040613","1076","14","Yet, oddly, the film appears to have no comedic high point."
"843","tt0040613","1076","15","Instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don't peak at any particular point."
"844","tt0040613","1076","16","That's a real movie triumph for any era."
"845","tt0040613","1076","17","Reaching back 60 years later, we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind."
"846","tt0040613","1076","18","With their live in maid, the Blandings may not be a typical American family, but that post war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical."
"847","tt0040613","1076","19","And what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than Blandings as an ""ad man"" tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more ""ham""."
"848","tt0040613","1076","20","More than anything, however, there's the movie's sunny optimism."
"849","tt0040613","1076","21","Oh sure, the feeling falters at times, yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the Blandings just stick to their dream carries them through."
"850","tt0040613","1076","22","Indeed, life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge, so I expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day."
"851","tt0040613","1076","23","It's that easily over looked subtext, along with the sheer entertainment value, that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post war period."
"852","tt0040613","1076","24","So, if you haven't seen it, catch it next time around."
"853","tt0040613","1077","1","This is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and ARE WE DONE YET., only points out all the more how the 40's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since, regretfully, been lost."
"854","tt0040613","1077","2","I was 15 when I first saw this and even at that tender age, there was much I could laugh at."
"855","tt0040613","1077","3","Now of course being familiar with adult frustrations, I see a whole lot that I missed as a youth."
"856","tt0040613","1077","4","The three main actors..."
"857","tt0040613","1077","5","Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas...interacted perfectly, but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream."
"858","tt0040613","1077","6","It's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions."
"859","tt0040613","1077","7","All in all, this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it."
"860","tt0040613","1078","1","Coinciding with the start of the baby boom, the years after World War II saw an unprecedented exodus of Americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes."
"861","tt0040613","1078","2","Directed by H.C."
"862","tt0040613","1078","3","Potter and co written by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank ""White Christmas"", this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well."
"863","tt0040613","1078","4","Of course, it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs  Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and an especially acerbic Melvyn Douglas  head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership."
"864","tt0040613","1078","5","Even though the film is sixty years old now, there is a timeless quality to the Blandings' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it."
"865","tt0040613","1078","6","Obviously, Hollywood thinks so since it's been remade at least twice first as a very physical Tom Hanks comedy, 1986's ""The Money Pit"", and again last year with Ice Cube's ""Are We Done Yet.""."
"866","tt0040613","1078","7","One look at HGTV's programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today."
"867","tt0040613","1078","8","The plot begins with ad man Jim Blandings, his wife Muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom one bath Manhattan apartment."
"868","tt0040613","1078","9","Rather than pursue Muriel's idea to renovate the apartment for $7,000, Jim sees a photo of a Connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move."
"869","tt0040613","1078","10","With the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend Bill Cole, the Blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair."
"870","tt0040613","1078","11","However, the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one."
"871","tt0040613","1078","12","This sparks the Blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first."
"872","tt0040613","1078","13","Costs rise with each new complication, tempers flare, and even a romantic triangle is imagined among, Jim, Muriel and Bill."
"873","tt0040613","1078","14","Priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not so blissful ignorance of the new homeowners."
"874","tt0040613","1078","15","With his double takes and flawless line delivery, Grant is infallible in this type of farce, and Jim Blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid career characters."
"875","tt0040613","1078","16","In a role originally meant for Irene Dunne, Myrna Loy shows why she was Hollywood's perfect wife."
"876","tt0040613","1078","17","She doesn't get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make Muriel an appealing character on her own."
"877","tt0040613","1078","18","Watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette."
"878","tt0040613","1078","19","As avuncular, pipe smoking Bill ""Cole Bill Cole"", Melvyn Douglas shows his natural, easy going élan as Grant's foil."
"879","tt0040613","1078","20","Smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by Harry Shannon as the laconic well digger Mr."
"880","tt0040613","1078","21","Tesander, Lurene Tuttle as Jim's officious assistant Mary, and Louise Beavers as the Blandings' lovable maid Gussie."
"881","tt0040613","1078","22","The 2004 DVD provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing Grant and Dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling Grant with his then wife, actress Betsy Drake."
"882","tt0040613","1078","23","A most appropriate 1949 cartoon, ""The House of Tomorrow"", is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house."
"883","tt0040613","1078","24","The original theatrical trailers for ten of Grant's film classics complete the extras."
"884","tt0040613","1079","1","Though not seen in too many films prior, you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since."
"885","tt0040613","1079","2","Not one of Grant's nor Loy's best films, they make an outstanding effort together."
"886","tt0040613","1079","3","After all, with that much talent and very good supporting cast, you know the laughs will be there."
"887","tt0040613","1079","4","The film is light, has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through."
"888","tt0040613","1079","5","A great example of classic American film fare that has stood the test of time."
"889","tt0040613","1079","6","Definite Saturday afternoon fare, heavy on the popcorn."
"890","tt0040613","1080","1","Movie ""comedies"" nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor, foul language, and groin kicking."
"891","tt0040613","1080","2","Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the undemanding and slow of brain."
"892","tt0040613","1080","3","Sure, an occasional good comedy will come along, but they're becoming rarer all the time."""
"893","tt0040613","1080","4","Mr."
"894","tt0040613","1080","5","Blandings Buildings his Dream House"" shows what 1940s Hollywood was capable of, and it's just screamingly funny."
"895","tt0040613","1080","6","Jim and Muriel Blandings Cary Grant and Myrna Loy decide to build a house in the Connecticut suburbs."
"896","tt0040613","1080","7","The film follows their story, beginning with house hunting trips, the house's riotous construction, all the way to the finished home with its ""zuzz zuzz water softener""."
"897","tt0040613","1080","8","Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course Grant is particularly funny as he watches the house's costs zoom out of control."
"898","tt0040613","1080","9","However, the film is stolen by the Blandings' wise attorney, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas."
"899","tt0040613","1080","10","Managing to steal every scene he's in, Douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the Blandings lurch from crisis to crisis."
"900","tt0040613","1080","11","Reginald Denny as the Blandings' harried architect and Harry Shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful."
"901","tt0040613","1080","12","I've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh."
"902","tt0040613","1080","13","I think it's a good film to watch when you need a lift, whether you're building a house or not."
"903","tt0040613","1081","1","One of the great classic comedies."
"904","tt0040613","1081","2","Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama."
"905","tt0040613","1081","3","A fun, satirical film, a buyers beware guide to a new home."
"906","tt0040613","1081","4","Filled with great characters all of whom, Cary Grant is convinced, are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home."
"907","tt0040613","1081","5","A great look at life in the late 40's."
"908","tt0040613","1082","1","Mr."
"909","tt0040613","1082","2","Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made!"
"910","tt0040613","1082","3","If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life movies made with wit, taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek, check this one out."
"911","tt0040613","1082","4","Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed."
"912","tt0040613","1082","5","Grant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire."
"913","tt0040613","1082","6","Loy is adorable as his pre NOW wife."
"914","tt0040613","1082","7","The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker."
"915","tt0040613","1082","8","Art Direction and Editing are way above par."
"916","tt0040613","1082","9","The movie never stoops to the low rent, by the numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit."
"917","tt0040613","1083","1","Another example of the unique talents of Cary Grant."
"918","tt0040613","1083","2","A performance worthy of Oscar consideration, yet once again shunned by the Academy."
"919","tt0040613","1083","3","Mr."
"920","tt0040613","1083","4","Grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city."
"921","tt0040613","1083","5","The pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis loosely for the more modern Tom Hanks vehicle, ""The Money Pit""."
"922","tt0040613","1083","6","If you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex, this movie is a must see."
"923","tt0040613","1084","1","Musings: Pure delight from beginning to end."
"924","tt0040613","1084","2","Not a laugh riot, but a more subtle, sophisticated humor."
"925","tt0040613","1084","3","What a goldmine of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr.."
"926","tt0040613","1084","4","Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed."
"927","tt0040613","1084","5","A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his ""lallies to be rabbeted"", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know."
"928","tt0040613","1084","6","Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative."
"929","tt0040613","1084","7","At that, Barker yells up to his mates, ""OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so...."
"930","tt0040613","1084","8","YANK 'EM OUT!"""
"931","tt0040613","1084","9","A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards."
"932","tt0040613","1084","10","All Grant can do is moan."
"933","tt0040613","1084","11","Yes, the movie IS dated."
"934","tt0040613","1084","12","You'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks."
"935","tt0040613","1084","13","A classic movie that is really a treasure."
"936","tt0040613","1085","1","This movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about Murphy's Law being applied to home ownership and construction."
"937","tt0040613","1085","2","If a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional."
"938","tt0040613","1085","3","Since it was set in the 'simpler' forties, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era."
"939","tt0040613","1085","4","Grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by Loy and Douglas."
"940","tt0040613","1085","5","Their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10."
"941","tt0040613","1086","1","This movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace."
"942","tt0040613","1086","2","While this makes it pretty different from the average Grant film, it is still highly watchable and entertaining."
"943","tt0040613","1086","3","It's sort of like someone said ""let's just follow Cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed""."
"944","tt0040613","1086","4","Considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well."
"945","tt0040613","1086","5","While the film has pretty modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material."
"946","tt0040613","1086","6","It's a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family."
"947","tt0040613","1087","1","There is so much to love in this darling little comedy."
"948","tt0040613","1087","2","Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just been short of space,will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled Mr."
"949","tt0040613","1087","3","Blanding."
"950","tt0040613","1087","4","Melvyn Douglas,with great comedic flare, both narrates and acts as the Blandings' attorney and voice of reason."
"951","tt0040613","1087","5","As well Myrna Loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife."
"952","tt0040613","1087","6","But the best performance is Grant's."
"953","tt0040613","1087","7","He is the American everyman, especially relevant at the time of this film's release, when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war."
"954","tt0040613","1087","8","The themes are universal,lack of money, work strain, fear of infidelity."
"955","tt0040613","1087","9","Yes, it does wrap up awfully neatly, but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending."
"956","tt0040613","1087","10","It is still relevant today, and I must chalk up the poor reviews I see to a present preference for dumbed down, gross out comedies."
"957","tt0040613","1087","11","The look of the film is slick, and there are some great bits of comedy is well, particularly toward the beginning."
"958","tt0040613","1087","12","While it may have lost some of it's social relevance, nearly sixty years after it's release, it is still a gem."
"959","tt0040613","1088","1","Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams."
"960","tt0040613","1088","2","It all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget."
"961","tt0040613","1088","3","There are many great laughs even if the story is somewhat thin sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s Hollywood comedy style."
"962","tt0040613","1088","4","A definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses, which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience."
"963","tt0040613","1088","5","As he makes his exit, he assures the client Grant that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $100.00 from the total...or at least $50.00...but certainly $25.00."
"964","tt0040613","1088","6","Hilarious!"
"965","tt0040613","1089","1","This movie was made in 1948, but it still rings true today."
"966","tt0040613","1089","2","Very, very funny."
"967","tt0040613","1089","3","It begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it ""builds"" from there."
"968","tt0040613","1089","4","Anyone who has ever built a house, will find this movie very endearing."
"969","tt0040613","1089","5","Great cast."
"970","tt0040613","1089","6","Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film."
"971","tt0040613","1089","7","This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's....clothing, architecture and family life."
"972","tt0040613","1089","8","Many references are made to the cost of things, and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing."
"973","tt0040613","1089","9","I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely."
"974","tt0040613","1089","10","I am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it."
"975","tt0040613","1089","11","A true classic."
"976","tt0040613","1090","1","One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr."
"977","tt0040613","1090","2","Blandings Builds His Dream House."
"978","tt0040613","1090","3","Although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today."
"979","tt0040613","1090","4","Still Cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of Wham."
"980","tt0040613","1090","5","What made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post World War II years."
"981","tt0040613","1090","6","Returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the GI Bill of Rights which included home loans."
"982","tt0040613","1090","7","The problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand."
"983","tt0040613","1090","8","Around the time the book by Eric Hodgins and the film were so popular Congress passed and President Truman signed the Taft Ellender Wagner Housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business."
"984","tt0040613","1090","9","I had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early Fifties."
"985","tt0040613","1090","10","Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city Rochester."
"986","tt0040613","1090","11","Their place wasn't quite as grand as a house in Connecticut with eighteen rooms, still they lived there the rest of their lives the way Cary and Myrna most likely did."
"987","tt0040613","1090","12","Of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners."
"988","tt0040613","1090","13","Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas around to offer counsel, usually too late."
"989","tt0040613","1090","14","Truth be told he's kind of sweet on Myrna and Cary knows it."
"990","tt0040613","1090","15","Myrna Loy's role is simply an extension of Nora Charles."
"991","tt0040613","1090","16","If you can imagine the Charles's moving to the country and William Powell having the headaches Cary Grant does, the film would still work just fine."
"992","tt0040613","1090","17","Mr."
"993","tt0040613","1090","18","Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as comedy because the situations are universal."
"994","tt0040613","1090","19","And this review is dedicated to my Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years."
"995","tt0040613","1091","1","I loved this film."
"996","tt0040613","1091","2","I first saw it when I was 20 which was only four years ago and I enjoyed it so much, I brought my own copy the next day."
"997","tt0040613","1091","3","The comedy is well played by all involved."
"998","tt0040613","1091","4","I always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where Mr."
"999","tt0040613","1091","5","Tsanders explains why he found water at 6 ft in one area and 227 feet in another area."
"1000","tt0040613","1091","6","Also look for Jason Robards father who plays Mr."
"1001","tt0040613","1091","7","Retch."
"1002","tt0040613","1091","8","Talent ran in that family."
"1003","tt0040613","1092","1","By the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over, as films were moving in a different direction, comedically and otherwise."
"1004","tt0040613","1092","2","With television looming on the horizon, Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time."
"1005","tt0040613","1092","3","Where, one wonders, would movies have gone had television not come along, or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years."
"1006","tt0040613","1092","4","Mr."
"1007","tt0040613","1092","5","Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed."
"1008","tt0040613","1092","6","Ad man Jim Blandings, along with his wife and two daughters, are living in a nice but way too cramped New York City apartment, as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs."
"1009","tt0040613","1092","7","So he buys some property in Connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications."
"1010","tt0040613","1092","8","Well, almost."
"1011","tt0040613","1092","9","Had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind."
"1012","tt0040613","1092","10","Then again he might not have."
"1013","tt0040613","1092","11","You decide."
"1014","tt0040613","1092","12","On this frail premise a wonderful film results, full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one."
"1015","tt0040613","1092","13","Nothing comes easy in this life, as Mr."
"1016","tt0040613","1092","14","Blandings learns; but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way."
"1017","tt0040613","1092","15","There is, after all, the long run."
"1018","tt0040613","1092","16","But, Blandings asks himself every few minutes, how long is long."
"1019","tt0040613","1092","17","This movie is a delight."
"1020","tt0040613","1092","18","It is not, I suppose, a masterpiece in the Capra McCarey tradition, but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures, and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically."
"1021","tt0040613","1092","19","There is real warmth in the picture, and a good deal of W.C."
"1022","tt0040613","1092","20","Fieldsian hard edged reality obtruding periodically, but not so much as to leave a bad taste."
"1023","tt0040613","1092","21","The people in the film are all very smart and affluent, but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class."
"1024","tt0040613","1092","22","Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr. and Mrs."
"1025","tt0040613","1092","23","Blandings to perfection; while Melvyn Douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend, who often has to bring up unpleasant topics, such as how the real world works."
"1026","tt0040613","1092","24","There is, too, a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia, which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years, as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place."
"1027","tt0040613","1092","25","These people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural Connecticut."
"1028","tt0040613","1092","26","In a few short years things would change, as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear, destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns, which soon would be connected by highways, littered with bottles and cans, their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city."
"1029","tt0040613","1093","1","I always enjoy this movie when it shows up on TV.The one scene that always stands out, for me that is, is the one with the Myrna Loy and the painters foreman, where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says ""Did you get that, that's yellow, blue, green and white"""
"1030","tt0040613","1094","1","This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and still laugh out loud."
"1031","tt0040613","1094","2","In other places, I have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious, politically correct prigs."
"1032","tt0040613","1094","3","There is neither here, unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid."
"1033","tt0040613","1094","4","The lines are hilarious, and all the leads have never been better."
"1034","tt0040613","1094","5","Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant."
"1035","tt0040613","1094","6","If you've ever thought of or tried to build a new house, you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process, no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel, you are not alone!"
"1036","tt0040613","1095","1","Great acting, great movie."
"1037","tt0040613","1095","2","If you are thinking of building see this movie first."
"1038","tt0040613","1095","3","The dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same."
"1039","tt0040613","1095","4","The humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt."
"1040","tt0040613","1096","1","I first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot."
"1041","tt0040613","1096","2","After many subsequent viewings and purchase of the video it still makes me laugh out loud."
"1042","tt0040613","1096","3","Yes, it's a relic of another age a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class America but well executed is well executed."
"1043","tt0040613","1096","4","But it's also a document of its age a celebration of post war optimism, the baby boom and the nascent consumer age."
"1044","tt0040613","1096","5","This film is no ""guilty"" pleasure."
"1045","tt0040613","1096","6","Three wonderful sophisticated leads actors urbane Melvyn Douglas; bemused Cary Grant; daffily determined Myrna Loy complement each other and a memorable team of characters."
"1046","tt0040613","1096","7","My favourite scenes ""It means we gotta blast"" and ""Miss Stellwaggen"" and ""This little piggy""."
"1047","tt0040613","1096","8","Love it."
"1048","tt0040613","1097","1","I stopped short of giving ""Mr."
"1049","tt0040613","1097","2","Blandings Builds His Dream House"" 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit: the fact that a black person is the faithful servant somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit."
"1050","tt0040613","1097","3","But other than that, the movie's a hoot."
"1051","tt0040613","1097","4","Portraying middle class New York couple Jim Cary Grant and Muriel Blandings Myrna Loy trying to build a house in Connecticut, this flick has something for everyone."
"1052","tt0040613","1097","5","Grant is his usual flippant self, while Loy does quite well as merely a wife."
"1053","tt0040613","1097","6","But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs as Jim's and Muriel's lawyer Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he's making clear."
"1054","tt0040613","1097","7","As for the house itself...throughout most of the movie, you'll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there."
"1055","tt0040613","1097","8","The builders, contractors, and others also provide their fair share of laughs."
"1056","tt0040613","1097","9","All in all, a comedy classic."
"1057","tt0040613","1097","10","Also starring Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr."
"1058","tt0040613","1098","1","Modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake, ""The Money Pit."""
"1059","tt0040613","1098","2","Older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas were all ""superstars"" in an easier, less complicated era."
"1060","tt0040613","1098","3","Or was it."
"1061","tt0040613","1098","4","Time, of course, has a way of modifying perspectives, and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary, there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older, seemingly less provocative films."
"1062","tt0040613","1098","5","In ""Mr."
"1063","tt0040613","1098","6","Blandings Builds His Dream House,"" there may, therefore, be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948."
"1064","tt0040613","1098","7","There is political commentary, however subtle."
"1065","tt0040613","1098","8","Finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience, only lightly softened by the coming of Levittowns and the like."
"1066","tt0040613","1098","9","Politics in the movie."
"1067","tt0040613","1098","10","The Blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school which in real life would get teachers accused of communism."
"1068","tt0040613","1098","11","In real life, too, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, a Democrat, and a feminist."
"1069","tt0040613","1098","12","Melvyn Douglas was no less a Democratic firebrand: he was married to congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whom young Richard Nixon accused of being soft on communism and which ruined her."
"1070","tt0040613","1098","13","Jason Robards, sr., has a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable."
"1071","tt0040613","1098","14","More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, jr., would be for many years a very active liberal Democrat."
"1072","tt0040613","1098","15","Almost the odd fellow out was Cary Grant, whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in Hollywood that was already slipping."
"1073","tt0040613","1098","16","But this was 1948: Communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner."
"1074","tt0040613","1098","17","It would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films, and then not so subtly."
"1075","tt0040613","1099","1","Although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built or bought to your specifications, it is not the first, nor the last."
"1076","tt0040613","1099","2","In 1940 Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE by George S."

"1078","tt0040613","1099","4","And about fifteen years ago Shelly Long and Tom Hanks had the lead in THE MONEY PIT."
"1079","tt0040613","1099","5","The former was about moving into an 18th Century country house that...err, needs work."
"1080","tt0040613","1099","6","The latter was about building your dream house in the late 1980s."
"1081","tt0040613","1099","7","Although the two films have their moments, both are not as good as BLANDINGS, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name."
"1082","tt0040613","1099","8","Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are noticing the tight corners of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall."
"1083","tt0040613","1099","9","Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising executive in 1948 he is making $15,000.00 a year, which was like making $90,000.00 today, and lives in a luxury apartment which in the New York City of that day he rents!"
"1084","tt0040613","1099","10","he feels they should seek something better."
"1085","tt0040613","1099","11","He and Muriel take a drive into the country Connecticut and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want."
"1086","tt0040613","1099","12","And they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to."
"1087","tt0040613","1099","13","For one thing, they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise, if cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole Melvin Douglas, in a nicely sardonic role."
"1088","tt0040613","1099","14","For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer Ian Wolfe, sucking his chops quietly, with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of Connecticut."
"1089","tt0040613","1099","15","Bill points out he's paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth."
"1090","tt0040613","1099","16","There are problems about water supply that both Blandings just never think about, such as hard and soft water which leads to the Zis Zis Water softening machine."
"1091","tt0040613","1099","17","They find that the designs they have in mind, and have worked out with their architect Reginald Denny, can't be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by Muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for."

"1093","tt0040613","1099","19","He has been appointed to handle the ""Wham"" account ""Spam"" had become a popular result of World War II, in that the public started using it as a meat substitute, in the light of it's success with the armed forces."
"1094","tt0040613","1099","20","Jim can't get a grip on this he's not alone one or two other executives fumbled it before him."
"1095","tt0040613","1099","21","He comes up with the following bit of ""poetry"".:""This little piggy went to market,He was pink and as pretty as ham."

"1097","tt0040613","1099","23","His Secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one!"
"1098","tt0040613","1099","24","Jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of Bill to Muriel, although in this case Bill is blameless."
"1099","tt0040613","1099","25","But he's always around Jim keeps forgetting that Bill is the clearheaded one, and that he's keeping Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes."

"1102","tt0040613","1099","28","He breaks a window, and the door opens by itself."
"1103","tt0040613","1099","29","The film works quite satisfactorily, with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves."
"1104","tt0040613","1099","30","It is one film which despite changing price levels and salary levels really does not age at all."

"1106","tt0040613","1099","32","A number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell regarding the paint job Parnell's company has to do on the various rooms."
"1107","tt0040613","1099","33","She carefully shows the distinct shades of red, blue, etc. she wants even giving a polite Parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue."
"1108","tt0040613","1099","34","The commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job."
"1109","tt0040613","1099","35","They proudly called Loy ""Mrs."

"1118","tt0040613","1100","7","What makes this movie so special is the three main actors Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas."
"1119","tt0040613","1100","8","Any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special."
"1120","tt0040613","1100","9","Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role."
"1121","tt0040613","1100","10","He is so good at playing the put upon husband."
"1122","tt0040613","1100","11","Loy is a always a joy to watch."
"1123","tt0040613","1100","12","The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect."
"1124","tt0040613","1100","13","And Douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years."
"1125","tt0040613","1100","14","Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, a particular favorite of mine."

"1128","tt0040613","1100","17","Throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live in maid and it becomes almost fanciful."
"1129","tt0040613","1100","18","However, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and predicaments the Blanding's find themselves in are easily relatable to today."
"1130","tt0040613","1100","19","And that's where the comedy comes in."
"1131","tt0040613","1100","20","How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected."
"1132","tt0040613","1100","21","The biggest complaint I have about Mr."
"1133","tt0040613","1100","22","Blandings is the whole ""wife in love with best friend"" subplot."
"1134","tt0040613","1100","23","It's really not necessary to the plot and feels out of place and very uncomfortable as presented."
"1135","tt0040613","1101","1","While the prices have gone up a lot, and some of the details have become dated, any homeowner who's struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie."

"1142","tt0040613","1101","8","Yet only a short distance away, a few days later, the basement of his house to be floods!"
"1143","tt0040613","1101","9","Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give believable performances as the harried Blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined, and Melvyn Douglas is even better as Blanding's lawyer and family friend."
"1144","tt0040613","1101","10","The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948."
"1145","tt0040613","1101","11","Mrs."
"1146","tt0040613","1101","12","Blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she's causing, and there's a black maid horrors!."
"1147","tt0040613","1101","13","So don't watch this movie through the social lens of 2003, and you'll enjoy it all the more."

"1155","tt0040613","1102","8","Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man moved by the impulse of accomplishing with the American Dream of owning a huge house that finds that made bad choice, while losing his touch in his work and feeling jealous of his friend."
"1156","tt0040613","1102","9","In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very funny movie visibly inspired in this delightful classic, ""The Money Pit""."

"1161","tt0040613","1103","3","This is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please."
"1162","tt0040613","1103","4","As a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining; and with major stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas... how could you go wrong."
"1163","tt0040613","1103","5","Comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued, and is very difficult to imitate."
"1164","tt0040613","1103","6","A good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long."
"1165","tt0040613","1103","7","Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments."

"1171","tt0040613","1104","5","One of three collaborations between Grant and Loy, this is a charming little comedy not very taxing, with no real great message, but a great way to spend an hour or two."
"1172","tt0040613","1104","6","The laughs are there right from the start, when the alarm clock goes off and Jim tries to shut it off, only to be thwarted at every turn by Muriel."
"1173","tt0040613","1104","7","The timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros, and that's just what Grant and Loy give us: polished performances, simple chemistry, and a lot of fun."
"1174","tt0040613","1104","8","Myrna Loy is in a pretty thankless role it's evident that Grant's character Jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting, and Grant, as always, pulls both off with remarkable aplomb, but she gives Muriel a colour, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give a character."
"1175","tt0040613","1104","9","Melvyn Douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well, never hitting a single wrong note."
"1176","tt0040613","1104","10","One of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when Bill gets himself locked in the 'store room', and Jim goes to 'save' him... only to get everyone trapped inside!"
"1177","tt0040613","1104","11","Every little problem that pops up for the Blandings renovation project including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for 'Wham' seems to bring together everything that could go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch."

"1185","tt0040613","1105","7","Obviously, a first time owner, Jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent."
"1186","tt0040613","1105","8","This is only the beginning of his problems."
"1187","tt0040613","1105","9","Whatever could be wrong, goes wrong."
"1188","tt0040613","1105","10","The architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn't work for the new house, after the original one is razed."
"1189","tt0040613","1105","11","As one problem leads to another, more money is necessary, and whatever was going to be the original cost, ends up in an inflated price that Jim could not really afford."
"1190","tt0040613","1105","12","The film is fun because of the three principals in it."
"1191","tt0040613","1105","13","Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of Jim Blandings."
"1192","tt0040613","1105","14","Myrna Loy, was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite Mr."
"1193","tt0040613","1105","15","Grant."
"1194","tt0040613","1105","16","The third character, Bill Cole, an old boyfriend of Myrna, turned lawyer for the Blandings, is suave and debonair, the way Melvin Douglas portrayed him."
"1195","tt0040613","1105","17","One of the Blandings girls, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Eva Marie Saint."
"1196","tt0040613","1105","18","The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but doesn't have much to do."
"1197","tt0040613","1105","19","The film is lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better."
"1198","tt0040613","1105","20","The direction of H.C."
"1199","tt0040613","1105","21","Potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies."
"1200","tt0042832","4909","1","Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be laughably bad, and laughably inaccurate examble: remember ""The Savage Bees""."
"1201","tt0042832","4909","2","But I'll make an exception for ""Tightrope"", which almost got it right."
"1202","tt0042832","4909","3","Here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong."
"1203","tt0042832","4909","4","The accents are not too bad yes, the ""yat"" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern, the city of 1950 is shown the way it is/was, without the obligatory ""tourist"" shots, and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a ""quirky southerner""."
"1204","tt0042832","4909","5","One of the few films to do justice to this city, and a good film to boot.."
"1205","tt0042832","4910","1","This very good movie crackles with tension."
"1206","tt0042832","4910","2","The stakes are, of course, high will the police and Widmark, the public health doctor, apprehend the criminals who don't know that they are carrying plague before a full scale epidemic breaks out."
"1207","tt0042832","4910","3","But smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene between Widmark and the police captain, between the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a dying plague stricken man whom Palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity, between Widmark and his wife, and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full scale panic."
"1208","tt0042832","4910","4","The movie is beautifully shot by Kazan, in extraordinarily well choreographed long takes shot on location in New Orleans, and ends in a stunning climax, where Palance flees like a rat from his pursuers, through the docks and warehouses of the city."
"1209","tt0042832","4910","5","The commentary is superb, probably the best that I've heard, covering the cinematography, the framing and lighting of shots, the production design, the casting of non professional actors in small roles, and the ironies and parallelisms in the plot, like an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally."
"1210","tt0042832","4910","6","Watch it once to enjoy the film on its own, and, if you are interested in film making, a second time with the commentary on to learn."
"1211","tt0042832","4911","1","This film has, over the past ten years, become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences."
"1212","tt0042832","4911","2","The three storyline threads given us by Kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures."
"1213","tt0042832","4911","3","The domestic chitchat between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between rooms, the small gestures such as the phone book Barbara places on the chair under her son so he can reach the table, those small intimate exchanges between husband and wife, all are well crafted and natural."
"1214","tt0042832","4911","4","More than anything else, I love their porch, that second living room where it is clear they spend much of their summer time."
"1215","tt0042832","4911","5","The second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film but especially between Widmark and Douglas' characters."
"1216","tt0042832","4911","6","It may not be totally original and does get a bit blustery but all in all, it comes across as real, respectful and efficient."
"1217","tt0042832","4911","7","The third thread,the grungy tale of Blackie and his tattered little gang, gets us closest to a dark and frightening noir world."
"1218","tt0042832","4911","8","Palance's Blackie is as cold as a block of ice."
"1219","tt0042832","4911","9","This self proclaimed business man, this self made man clearly has a complexity we only briefly tap in to."
"1220","tt0042832","4911","10","For me, this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience."
"1221","tt0042832","4912","1","One of America's most brilliant film directors was without question Elia Kazan."
"1222","tt0042832","4912","2","His directorial genius was not particularly suited to taut thrillers, since Kazan needed more room to breathe and to be slower and more subtle."
"1223","tt0042832","4912","3","However, 'Panic in the Streets' is a first rate social thriller and is if anything more relevant to today than it was to 1950 when it was released."
"1224","tt0042832","4912","4","The themes of illegal immigrants, people smuggling, imminent plagues, rapid transmission around the world of diseases a worried Richard Widmark says: 'I could be in any American city in ten hours and in Africa tomorrow.', ethnic isolation and ghettoism are today's concerns more than ever."
"1225","tt0042832","4912","5","This film features a spectacular film debut by Jack Palance, and a wonderful performance by Barbara Bel Geddes, two casting strokes of genius."
"1226","tt0042832","4912","6","Richard Widmark is allowed not to be a psychopath for once, and is a deeply caring, warmly loving, intense hero of the people."
"1227","tt0042832","4912","7","He leads basically a one man campaign to stop an epidemic of pneumonic plague in New Orleans, struggling to convince sluggish politicians and complacent policemen that there is a problem."
"1228","tt0042832","4912","8","There is a race against time to find the small time crooks who have contracted the plague from a dead illegal immigrant within 48 hours, before the whole city, and as they are always reminding us, the whole country, are endangered with the worst thing since the 1919 flu."
"1229","tt0042832","4912","9","One amazing scene where Jack Palance, who is infected, is prevented from climbing aboard a ship by a rat barrier on the rope is ironic in the extreme, reminding us in the most gruesome terms that humans can be the worst carriers and vermin of all."
"1230","tt0042832","4912","10","The highly dramatic chase scenes in what they call 'the coffee factory' at the wharfs rivals the most inventive climax scenes of Hitchcock, and with just as spectacular a setting."
"1231","tt0042832","4912","11","Many non professionals appear in the film, which has the gritty realism of, well, something called reality."
"1232","tt0042832","4912","12","Kazan really takes the cameras into places where even people rarely went, and where even rats would have thought twice."
"1233","tt0042832","4912","13","This film was a major feat of social realism."
"1234","tt0042832","4912","14","If it lacks the electricity of the most highly charged thrillers, it is because Kazan took it so seriously that he could not hype it up, for after all, the threat of plague is serious enough to scare anybody without the need for extra guns and molls."
"1235","tt0042832","4912","15","The only unfortunate thing about the film is the title, which gives a false suggestion of superficiality."
"1236","tt0042832","4912","16","But Kazan was anything but superficial."
"1237","tt0042832","4912","17","He clearly considered this project a public duty, to alert us to genuine possibilities."
"1238","tt0042832","4912","18","If only those possibilities had diminished today, but alas, they are getting worse every day."
"1239","tt0042832","4912","19","One day, after a worldwide plague, this film may be shown to a few survivors as an example of how an outbreak was contained on film, but its lessons were forgotten."
"1240","tt0042832","4913","1","The title overstates the content of this movie somewhat, which might lead to some unrealized expectations."
"1241","tt0042832","4913","2","Frankly speaking, there's very little ""panic in the streets"" to be seen here."
"1242","tt0042832","4913","3","In fact, throughout the movie very few people actually know that there's a murderer on the loose who may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters."
"1243","tt0042832","4913","4","Having said that, what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway because, unlike the people ""in the streets"", the viewer knows what's going on and that director Elia Kazan builds very deliberately."
"1244","tt0042832","4913","5","As the plague infected killer is sought, one of the more interesting sidebars I found was the developing relationship between Dr."
"1245","tt0042832","4913","6","Reed Richard Widmark and Police Captain Warren Paul Douglas."
"1246","tt0042832","4913","7","At the beginning, the two really don't like each other, even though they have to work together."
"1247","tt0042832","4913","8","By the end, they've forged a real bond of respect for each other."
"1248","tt0042832","4913","9","Kazan did a good job with that."
"1249","tt0042832","4913","10","Pretty much all the performances here were excellent."
"1250","tt0042832","4913","11","Widmark and Douglas were great, and I was quite taken with a very early look at Jack Palance playing what would become his typical ""heavy"" role."
"1251","tt0042832","4913","12","I found very little to criticize here."
"1252","tt0042832","4913","13","Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes came across as a little bit flat as Reed's wife Nancy, but her role wasn't really central to the story."
"1253","tt0042832","4913","14","All in all, an excellent piece of work."
"1254","tt0042832","4913","15","9/10"
"1255","tt0042832","4914","1","A small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store, and picking stuff just because I haven't seen it."
"1256","tt0042832","4914","2","A large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen."
"1257","tt0042832","4914","3","Long before Elia Kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies not good ones, he made this better than average drama."
"1258","tt0042832","4914","4","Watching it you begin to notice how many decent, good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated."
"1259","tt0042832","4914","5","Contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large... preferably large, and unsubtle, and scandalous."
"1260","tt0042832","4914","6","Kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director. um."
"1261","tt0042832","4914","7","No thanks His future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot."
"1262","tt0042832","4914","8","The plague is coming!"
"1263","tt0042832","4914","9","But here's an atypical Richard Widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope; here's an almost watchable Barabra bel Geddes, with her bathos turned way down well, for her; they're a couple and they share some nicely written scenes about big crises and smaller ones."
"1264","tt0042832","4914","10","Here's an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships crew; here's a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment."
"1265","tt0042832","4914","11","These are the small scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life; something Hollywood, in its greed, now studiously avoids."
"1266","tt0042832","4914","12","These are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them."
"1267","tt0042832","4914","13","It's a personable, human scaled film, not the grotesque, overscaled production that he and others David Lean will later popularize, whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as Pirates of the Caribean and Moulin Rouge."
"1268","tt0042832","4914","14","I just watched it twice and I'll be damned if I could tell you what Jack Palance is seeking in the final scenes, but it doesn't seem that important to me as a viewer."
"1269","tt0042832","4914","15","This reminds me of both No Way Out a Poitier noir with Widmark as the villain, and Naked City, which you should really get your hands on."
"1270","tt0042832","4915","1","And a rather Unexpected plot line too for the era: there is Plague in the City of New Orleans and only Richard Widmark can stop it!"
"1271","tt0042832","4915","2","Elia Kazan's trademark subjects: waterfronts, working men, crowds, fugitives, blue collar folk, violence on a backstreet are all showcased here."
"1272","tt0042832","4915","3","Jack Palance is quite effective as the ice cold mobster out for a big score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise somewhat miscast but certainly watchable as his go fer."
"1273","tt0042832","4915","4","I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as the stalwart, cool wife I thought she and Widmark were a believable couple."
"1274","tt0042832","4915","5","He himself always reminds me somewhat of Sinatra in the face and in the intense quiet manner and that is meant as a compliment if anything."
"1275","tt0042832","4915","6","I'd never even heard of this movie, and yes, you have to admire Widmark's performance."
"1276","tt0042832","4915","7","I also enjoyed Paul Douglas he seemed to play this role many times, they make an unlikely but effective team."
"1277","tt0042832","4915","8","The plague itself is a McGuffin and you gotta know it's not exactly done the way it would have been in Real Life rather small scale at the least no. but I found it carried the plot along nicely."
"1278","tt0042832","4915","9","Check this out."
"1279","tt0042832","4915","10","It's good.  outta"
"1280","tt0042832","4916","1","Plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan."
"1281","tt0042832","4916","2","Kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes."
"1282","tt0042832","4916","3","A man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game."
"1283","tt0042832","4916","4","It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact."
"1284","tt0042832","4916","5","City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease."
"1285","tt0042832","4916","6","A detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles."
"1286","tt0042832","4916","7","Streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community."
"1287","tt0042832","4916","8","Regardless of outcome, you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film's protagonist."
"1288","tt0042832","4916","9","Richard Widmark as Dr."
"1289","tt0042832","4916","10","Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers."
"1290","tt0042832","4916","11","Barbera Bel Geddis as Reed's wife has some good moments with Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of restful more than comic relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the New Orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer Joe McDonald."
"1291","tt0042832","4916","12","Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic."
"1292","tt0042832","4916","13","Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie Black Death. is simply outstanding."
"1293","tt0042832","4916","14","With riveting intensity Palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well."
"1294","tt0042832","4916","15","In addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity, especially in the film's powerful final allegorical moments."
"1295","tt0042832","4916","16","Panic in the Streets is probably Kazan's best non Brando film."
"1296","tt0042832","4916","17","It's tension filled, suspensefully well paced and edited."
"1297","tt0042832","4916","18","It's ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows Kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with Panic he succeeds with aplomb."
"1298","tt0042832","4917","1","'Panic in the Streets 1950' owes more to British noir that its American counterparts."
"1299","tt0042832","4917","2","Like Reed's 'The Third Man 1949' and Dassin's 'Night and the City 1950,' director Elia Kazan chose to film largely on location, capturing the fresh and vibrant decadence of the New Orleans slums."
"1300","tt0042832","4917","3","In a decision borrowed from the masters of Italian neorealism, he also hired many non professional actors for minor roles, lending an air of authenticity to the cityscape."
"1301","tt0042832","4917","4","However, any further comparisons with neorealism would be misguided, for 'Panic in the Streets' is pure melodrama, of the best kind."
"1302","tt0042832","4917","5","A murdered illegal immigrant, fished out of the bay, is found to be infected with pneumonic plague, a deadly air borne mutation of bubonic plague, which is transmitted from human to human and, untreated, has a mortality rate that approaches 100%."
"1303","tt0042832","4917","6","Clinton Reed Richard Widmark, an officer with the U.S."
"1304","tt0042832","4917","7","Public Health Service, convinces the doubtful police chief Paul Douglas to undertake a city wide manhunt for the men responsible for the homicide, lest they also be infected with the illness."
"1305","tt0042832","4917","8","In my younger years, I found Wolfgang Petersen's 'Outbreak 1995' to be among the most horrifying movies I'd ever seen."
"1306","tt0042832","4917","9","That thriller, which owes plenty to 'Panic in the Streets' working title: ""Outbreak"", terrified me so efficiently because it depicted the ebola virus as both an invisible and invincible killer  how does one defend themselves against such a thing."
"1307","tt0042832","4917","10","Kazan's film is the first that I know of to approach the subject of biological epidemics, though it has difficulty ascribing visual recognition to an enemy that is basically undetectable to the human eye; it instead uses Jack Palance as a human personification of the Plague."
"1308","tt0042832","4917","11","Despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society, you never get the sense that Clinton Reed is placing his own life at risk some viewers have noted that Reed never inoculated himself against the plague, though I think it's safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff."
"1309","tt0042832","4917","12","Nevertheless, there's still a strong sense of urgency in the hunt for the infected man's killers, underground street rats who pollute the sewers with their misdeeds."
"1310","tt0042832","4917","13","In medieval times, when the Black Death now widely believed to have been bubonic plague swept across the civilised world, killing a third of Europe's population, many identified the destruction as being the work of the Devil."
"1311","tt0042832","4917","14","Jack Palance's character, Blackie, serves effectively as Satan in human form: the angular jawed thug can occasionally be charming and charismatic, but is always liable to explode into fits of violence; his two hoodlums played by Guy Thomajan and Zero Mostel, through terror more than anything else, are constantly grovelling at his feet."
"1312","tt0042832","4917","15","When one lackey falls ill with fever, Blackie deduces that the man's immigrant cousin must have ""brought something in with him"" the irony of his conclusion not passing unnoticed, and so attempts to ascertain what this presumably valuable object must be."
"1313","tt0042832","4917","16","He cradles the dying Poldi in his arms, a grotesque display of faux affection that is both pathetic and unsettling."
"1314","tt0042832","4917","17","Blackie/Satan is finally stopped  not by the authorities, but by the burden of his own infection/evil  as he attempts to board a cargo ship, the primary vessel by which the Plague spread across Europe."
"1315","tt0042832","4918","1","As the film opens, two thugs kill another thug."
"1316","tt0042832","4918","2","When the body is discovered and about to be autopsied, the doctor realizes that although the man was shot dead, he was also suffering from the Pneumonic plague a very nasty and more virulent version of the Bubonic plague!"
"1317","tt0042832","4918","3","So, it's a race against time to find those who came in contact with the dead man and treat them immediately, otherwise a disaster could erupt."
"1318","tt0042832","4918","4","Oddly, I actually know quite a bit about the Pneumonic plague, as I taught a series of lectures on it for my history classes."
"1319","tt0042832","4918","5","The film really did not do a good job of getting the facts right about the disease in that it looked little like what the people had in the movie."
"1320","tt0042832","4918","6","The biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they really wouldn't have been allowed to show it."
"1321","tt0042832","4918","7","Sure, there is high fever and coughing they got this right but also lots of bleeding and explosive vomiting of blackened blood along with the enormously swollen lymph nodes like you'd get with the Bubonic plague all purply and gross!"
"1322","tt0042832","4918","8","I can certainly understand why they didn't go this far."
"1323","tt0042832","4918","9","Also, I am sure that the federal government would have had a much, much greater involvement in controlling and treating the disease here in the film it was handled on a very local level and everyone seemed ill prepared and a bit dumb."
"1324","tt0042832","4918","10","No one seemed willing to believe the doctors!!"
"1325","tt0042832","4918","11","As for the acting, the film had some excellent actors here."
"1326","tt0042832","4918","12","Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are, respectively, the public health doctor and police chief."
"1327","tt0042832","4918","13","Good actors but also known actors back in 1950."
"1328","tt0042832","4918","14","However, in his first film is the very menacing Jack Palance still going by his original moniker, 'Walter Jack Palance' as well as the relatively unknown at the time Zero Mostel."
"1329","tt0042832","4918","15","Palance was great very scary and very physically adept in his own stunts."
"1330","tt0042832","4918","16","Mostel played a heavy typical of his early work a greasy and cowardly sort of evil."
"1331","tt0042832","4918","17","Overall, despite really not getting the details right and wrapping everything up a little too neatly, the film is very tense and has excellent acting and is well worth seeing."
"1332","tt0042832","4919","1","Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar."
"1333","tt0042832","4919","2","Some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and rate it very highly."
"1334","tt0042832","4919","3","I can almost see where they are coming from."
"1335","tt0042832","4919","4","But I prefer to take a more toned down approach to a long forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi documentary fashion."
"1336","tt0042832","4919","5","Pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor Widmark and a city detective Douglas to apprehend the main carrier Palance."
"1337","tt0042832","4919","6","The film is moody, shot in stark black and white, and makes very good use of locations."
"1338","tt0042832","4919","7","Widmark is wonderful as usual."
"1339","tt0042832","4919","8","Forget the symbolism crime equals disease, and disease equals crime and just enjoy the chase."
"1340","tt0042832","4919","9","It is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short lived post WWII through the early 1950s and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher."
"1341","tt0042832","4919","10","For those who will be watching this for the first time, sit tight for the big chase at the end."
"1342","tt0042832","4919","11","It is something else, and frankly I don't know how they filmed some of it."
"1343","tt0042832","4919","12","I can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie."
"1344","tt0042832","4920","1","No, not really, but this is a very good film indeed, and is sadly a forgotten gem."
"1345","tt0042832","4920","2","Black and white suits the film."
"1346","tt0042832","4920","3","Straight forward formula, a guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before they die."
"1347","tt0042832","4920","4","Very well directed, and the acting is great."
"1348","tt0042832","4920","5","Richard Widmark as the male lead is good but is completely over shadowed in the acting stakes by Paul Douglas as the police captain, and Jack Palance never better than this and Zero Mostel as the baddies."
"1349","tt0042832","4920","6","Sadly Palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies."
"1350","tt0042832","4921","1","Like A Streetcar Named Desire also directed by Gadg both on stage and screen Panic In The Streets depicts a New Orleans in which its major claim to fame the birthplace of Jazz doesn't even rate a mention."
"1351","tt0042832","4921","2","It was Richard Widmark's seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer."
"1352","tt0042832","4921","3","Gadg himself appears in an uncredited small role as a morgue attendant but the film is rich in talent beginning with Jack Palance still being billed as Walter Jack Palanceas the local Mr 'Big' followed side kick Zero Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig plus the rock solid ever reliable Paul Douglas as the cop who comes round to doc Widmark's point of view."
"1353","tt0042832","4921","4","It's a very rewarding movie more so for being little seen."
"1354","tt0042832","4921","5","Catch it if you can."
"1355","tt0042832","4922","1","I wonder what audiences of the day thought when first laying eyes on Walter Jack Palance Blackie."
"1356","tt0042832","4922","2","Certainly he looks like no one else of the time, that skull like face, flattened nose, and elongated body even now he remains an unsettling presence."
"1357","tt0042832","4922","3","And what could be more appropriate than his emergence out of those dingy New Orleans slums that appear to fester like the plague Blackie is loosing on the city."
"1358","tt0042832","4922","4","I'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes."
"1359","tt0042832","4922","5","The movie itself is very skillfully assembled the morgue's black humor, the Widmark Douglas interplay, the un touristy locations, the battles among officialsall are woven into a tensely realistic thriller with a menace unlike others of the time."
"1360","tt0042832","4922","6","Even Widmark's domestic scenes that put a woman Bel Geddes on the marquee manage not to be too disruptive."
"1361","tt0042832","4922","7","Director Kazan certainly shows his aptitude for helming a studio Fox product, no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspect."
"1362","tt0042832","4922","8","Widmark does a solid low key job as the public health officer."
"1363","tt0042832","4922","9","But my money is on the one and only Zero Mostel."
"1364","tt0042832","4922","10","Was there ever a sweatier performer who could squeal louder or get pushed around more than the bulky fall guy e.g."
"1365","tt0042832","4922","11","The Enforcer, 1950."
"1366","tt0042832","4922","12","That scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with Mostel's shrewish wife Liswood, is a gem of frantic subservience as Mostel tries to pacify each like some berserk pinball."
"1367","tt0042832","4922","13","Too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist."
"1368","tt0042832","4922","14","I wonder if it was the voluble Kazan who named him."
"1369","tt0042832","4922","15","But it's not only the professionals that add color."
"1370","tt0042832","4922","16","The locals add both character and authenticity, especially the two Asian guys interviewed by the cops."
"1371","tt0042832","4922","17","That whole scene has an improvised air, as if Kazan recognized their potential and fashioned a nifty little scene on the spot."
"1372","tt0042832","4922","18","Then too, that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration."
"1373","tt0042832","4922","19","And what about those flea bitten coffee shops that have me running to the nearest Denny's."
"1374","tt0042832","4922","20","Anyway, the movie is still a well staged, riveting thriller with an apocalyptic air that oddly foreshadows many of today's mega hits."
"1375","tt0042832","4923","1","""Panic In The Streets"" is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director Elia Kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in New Orleans, using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation."
"1376","tt0042832","4923","2","As a result, the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable."
"1377","tt0042832","4923","3","An important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster, provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken, then increase the tension to a high level."
"1378","tt0042832","4923","4","Following a dispute between the participants in a card game, a man called Kochak Lewis Charles is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area."
"1379","tt0042832","4923","5","When the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus, U.S."
"1380","tt0042832","4923","6","Public Health official Dr Clinton Reed Richard Widmark is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague."
"1381","tt0042832","4923","7","Reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action, anyone infected could be expected to die within days."
"1382","tt0042832","4923","8","As the identity of the dead man is unknown, the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the Police Commissioner are not fully convinced by Reed's briefing."
"1383","tt0042832","4923","9","They doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently."
"1384","tt0042832","4923","10","The investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community, a group of seamen, the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man's identity and his contacts are eventually found."
"1385","tt0042832","4923","11","Kochak, an illegal immigrant, had been in a gang with Blackie Jack Palance, Raymond Fitch Zero Mostel and Vince Poldi Tommy Cook and when gang leader Blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation, he presumes that Kochak must've smuggled something very valuable into the country."
"1386","tt0042832","4923","12","As Kochak and Poldi were related, Blackie assumes that Poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more."
"1387","tt0042832","4923","13","Poldi, however, is very ill and unable to provide any information."
"1388","tt0042832","4923","14","Blackie brings in his own doctor and together with Fitch starts to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed and an exciting chase follows."
"1389","tt0042832","4923","15","Richard Widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man."
"1390","tt0042832","4923","16","In an unusual type of role for him, he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of Dr Reed very convincingly."
"1391","tt0042832","4923","17","Jack Palance's film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges Kochak's reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation."
"1392","tt0042832","4923","18","His distinctive looks also help to make his on screen presence even more compelling."
"1393","tt0042832","4923","19","In typical docu noir style, expressionist cinematography and neo realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place."
"1394","tt0042832","4923","20","Elia Kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside."
"1395","tt0042832","4924","1","A doctor and a policeman in New Orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague."
"1396","tt0042832","4924","2","An effective, and classy, little thriller directed by Elia Kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat."
"1397","tt0042832","4924","3","Set and filmed in and around New Orleans, Panic In The Streets is taken from the story Quarantine, Some Like 'em Cold by Edna and Edward Anhalt who won an Oscar for original story."
"1398","tt0042832","4924","4","It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director."
"1399","tt0042832","4924","5","In turn, Richard Widmark bringing the method a year before Marlon did for Kazan in A Streetcar Named Desire, Paul Douglas, Jack Palance as Walter Jack Palance & the wonderfully named Zero Mostel, all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential Black Death epidemic."
"1400","tt0042832","4924","6","Where the film scores its main suspense points is with Kazan's astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece."
"1401","tt0042832","4924","7","From Widmark's Public Health doctor, with hypodermic needle in hand, running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good; to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them; the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point."
"1402","tt0042832","4924","8","To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema."
"1403","tt0042832","4924","9","With Palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of Widmark's own Tommy Udo from Kiss Of Death three years prior."
"1404","tt0042832","4924","10","It's an imaginative and intelligently written story, one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease."
"1405","tt0042832","4924","11","A blight on society as it were."
"1406","tt0042832","4924","12","It's noirish elements, such as paranoia, blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being."
"1407","tt0042832","4924","13","While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created."
"1408","tt0042832","4924","14","Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway, this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end."
"1409","tt0042832","4924","15","Not essential film noir, and maybe not even essential Kazan, but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day."
"1410","tt0042832","4924","16","7.5/10"
"1411","tt0042832","4925","1","A neat 'race against time' premise A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them."
"1412","tt0042832","4925","2","This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it's well worth downloading."
"1413","tt0042832","4925","3","A lot all. of this movie was filmed in genuine New Orleans locations, which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail, though to me it does look under exposed, even for noir maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are."
"1414","tt0042832","4925","4","There is also a plenty of location background noise, which is slightly distracting car horns in the love scene, anyone."
"1415","tt0042832","4925","5","There are a lot of non professional supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with not much chance for retakes or recasting, though the final chase is worth hanging on for."
"1416","tt0042832","4925","6","There's not much wrong with the lead actors either: Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific, while Widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level most of the time."
"1417","tt0042832","4925","7","Somebody should remake this no supernaturals, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good yarn full of character conflict, and a topical theme."
"1418","tt0042832","4925","8","Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types peppering this dark, sleazy, against the clock drama."
"1419","tt0042832","4925","9","There's even a midget newspaper seller."""
"1420","tt0042832","4925","10","Community."
"1421","tt0042832","4925","11","What community."
"1422","tt0042832","4925","12","D'you think you're living in the Middle Ages."""
"1423","tt0042832","4926","1","Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors this country ever had, showed he was equally at home with movies."
"1424","tt0042832","4926","2","With ""Panic in the Streets"", Mr."
"1425","tt0042832","4926","3","Kazan gives us an early version of what would come later, with perhaps his master piece, ""On the Waterfront"", although both movies share only the water setting, for they are different visions about different subjects."
"1426","tt0042832","4926","4","Mr."
"1427","tt0042832","4926","5","Kazan shot on location in New Orleans."
"1428","tt0042832","4926","6","The adaptation by Daniel Fuchs of the Edna and Edward Anhalt stories that are the basis of the film, is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting ""The Big Easy""."
"1429","tt0042832","4926","7","One of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by Joseph MacDonald that shows New Orleans at its best."
"1430","tt0042832","4926","8","Also the music by Alfred Newman and the song by Billie Holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch."
"1431","tt0042832","4926","9","This film, could have been shot in New York, or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like ""broklynese"" than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country."
"1432","tt0042832","4926","10","One thing comes clear in the movie, Jack Palance, making his screen debut, smolders the screen every time one sees him."
"1433","tt0042832","4926","11","He was so intense!"
"1434","tt0042832","4926","12","At the same time, this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner, who unknown to him, is stricken with a fatal disease."
"1435","tt0042832","4926","13","Blackie, comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man's greasy hair with abandon."
"1436","tt0042832","4926","14","Notable also, was the fact that Mr."
"1437","tt0042832","4926","15","Palance and Mr."
"1438","tt0042832","4926","16","Mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts, something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real."
"1439","tt0042832","4926","17","The film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film."
"1440","tt0042832","4926","18","We see a family man painting furniture with his young son."
"1441","tt0042832","4926","19","Later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his salary, something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis."
"1442","tt0042832","4926","20","Richard Widmark, playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people."
"1443","tt0042832","4926","21","Barbara Bel Geddes, as the wife, sounds as though she's a suburban woman from Connecticut."
"1444","tt0042832","4926","22","The film is enjoyable thanks to Mr."
"1445","tt0042832","4926","23","Kazan's direction and the excellent cast working in the movie."
"1446","tt0042832","4927","1","Just a comment on New Orleans accents..."
"1447","tt0042832","4927","2","An earlier reviewer noted the following: ""This film, could have been shot in New York, or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like ""broklynese"" than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country."""
"1448","tt0042832","4927","3","There was also another comment along these lines from an English reviewer."
"1449","tt0042832","4927","4","Many people in New Orleans do, in fact, sound ""broklynese""."
"1450","tt0042832","4927","5","I have never found out why."
"1451","tt0042832","4927","6","It's mentioned in ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" by John Kennedy Toole."
"1452","tt0042832","4927","7","I always appreciate movies taking place in New Orleans that include this detail, as this one did."
"1453","tt0042832","4927","8","Too often it's just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent."
"1454","tt0042832","4928","1","Given its time of release, the story that unravels in 1950 thriller 'Panic in the Streets' was hardly a surprise."
"1455","tt0042832","4928","2","The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague."
"1456","tt0042832","4928","3","Yet with the current drama in the world today, this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers."
"1457","tt0042832","4928","4","The cast and crew are flawless."
"1458","tt0042832","4928","5","Richard Widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in 'Night and the City,' Jack Palance in his chilling film debut, also starring in this film are Paul Douglas and a young and rather cute Barbara Bel Geddes."
"1459","tt0042832","4928","6","A whole slew of uncredited, non professional actors typical of director Kazan fill in the remaining slots."
"1460","tt0042832","4928","7","Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald films he would later work with Richard Widmark again in 1953's much superior 'Pickup on South Street' and the great Alfred Newman scores it."
"1461","tt0042832","4928","8","Nearly everyone involved here has done better work, 'Panic in the Streets' is quite the rewarding watch, nonetheless."
"1462","tt0042832","4928","9","Especially for the film noir enthusiast."
"1463","tt0042832","4929","1","I can't really condemn the movie because it does work."
"1464","tt0042832","4929","2","There is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie, but I think it's only just in the category."
"1465","tt0042832","4929","3","There's nothing sinister in this piece, and that's where the noir elements fail."
"1466","tt0042832","4929","4","Sure, the disease might be considered sinister, but I have a hard time seeing that."
"1467","tt0042832","4929","5","The movie hints at a darker side: Blackie may be trafficking human beings, the New Orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter, the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie... but those are really only hints."
"1468","tt0042832","4929","6","There's no attempt made to question Reed's motivations, as one with do with Marlowe or Spade, nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to Blackie, which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played out."
"1469","tt0042832","4929","7","That lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end."
"1470","tt0042832","4929","8","The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and direction are well done... but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over."
"1471","tt0042832","4929","9","Worth watching once, maybe twice if you don't remember it from years ago, and then putting away."
"1472","tt0042832","4930","1","""Panic in the Streets"" was a decent thriller, but I felt a bit disappointed by it."
"1473","tt0042832","4930","2","The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never really explores or develops it."
"1474","tt0042832","4930","3","Its well made and entertaining, but its not as interesting as it should have been."
"1475","tt0042832","4930","4","The screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down."
"1476","tt0042832","4930","5","None of the central characters are really compelling or believable."
"1477","tt0042832","4930","6","Fortunately, the film is very well made so it compensates for the weak scripting."
"1478","tt0042832","4930","7","The direction by Elia Kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace."
"1479","tt0042832","4930","8","There are some standout sequences, particularly the memorable chase climax."
"1480","tt0042832","4930","9","When his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later, the man could mostly do no wrong."
"1481","tt0042832","4930","10","The acting is also very good."
"1482","tt0042832","4930","11","Richard Widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character."
"1483","tt0042832","4930","12","Paul Douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well."
"1484","tt0042832","4930","13","The standouts in the cast are the two villains."
"1485","tt0042832","4930","14","Zero Mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, is effectively slimy as one of cinema's ultimate toady characters."
"1486","tt0042832","4930","15","Jack Palance is, unsurprisingly, a chilling villain."
"1487","tt0042832","4930","16","""Panic in the Streets"" is disappointing but still worth watching."
"1488","tt0042832","4930","17","7/10"
"1489","tt0042832","4931","1","When plague breaks out in New Orleans, it's Richard Widmark to the rescue in ""Panic in the Streets,"" one of the lesser celebrated films of the great Elia Kazan."
"1490","tt0042832","4931","2","Kazan keeps the pace brisk, and there are lots of marvelous touches the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens, which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low lifes, portrayed by a menacing Jack Palance, his weak yes man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook, and Louis Charles."
"1491","tt0042832","4931","3","There are also some interesting visuals Palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height."
"1492","tt0042832","4931","4","The acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isn't quite up to the direction and performances."
"1493","tt0042832","4931","5","It has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily."
"1494","tt0042832","4931","6","That aside, it's well worth viewing."
"1495","tt0042832","4931","7","Kazan was a masterful director."
"1496","tt0042832","4932","1","In Panic In The Streets Richard Widmark plays U.S."
"1497","tt0042832","4932","2","Navy doctor who has his week rudely interrupted with a corpse that contains plague."
"1498","tt0042832","4932","3","As cop Paul Douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest."
"1499","tt0042832","4932","4","That's not the issue here, the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease."
"1500","tt0042832","4932","5","As was pointed out by any number of people, for some reason director Elia Kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like they're from Louisiana."
"1501","tt0042832","4932","6","Having been to New Orleans where the story takes place I can personally attest to that."
"1502","tt0042832","4932","7","Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be excused because as a Navy doctor he could be assigned there, but for those that are natives it doesn't work."
"1503","tt0042832","4932","8","But with plague out there and the news being kept a secret, the New Orleans PD starts a dragnet of the city's underworld."
"1504","tt0042832","4932","9","The dead guy came off a ship from Europe and he had underworld connections."
"1505","tt0042832","4932","10","A New Orleans wise guy played by Jack Palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague symptoms."
"1506","tt0042832","4932","11","Palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received notice."
"1507","tt0042832","4932","12","Personally my favorite in this film is Zero Mostel."
"1508","tt0042832","4932","13","This happened right before Mostel was blacklisted and around that time he made a specialty of playing would be tough guys who are really toadies."
"1509","tt0042832","4932","14","He plays the same kind of role in the Humphrey Bogart film, The Enforcer."
"1510","tt0042832","4932","15","Sadly I can kind of identify with Mostel in that last chase scene where he and Palance are being chased down by Widmark, Douglas, and half the New Orleans Police."
"1511","tt0042832","4932","16","Seeing the weight challenged Zero trying to keep up with Palance was something else because I'm kind of in Zero's league now in the heft department."
"1512","tt0042832","4932","17","Kazan kept the action going at a good clip, there's very little down time in this film."
"1513","tt0042832","4932","18","If there was any less it would be an Indiana Jones film."
"1514","tt0042832","4932","19","Panic In The Streets won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay that year."
"1515","tt0042832","4932","20","Kazan also made good use of the New Orleans waterfront and the French Quarter."
"1516","tt0042832","4932","21","Some of the same kinds of shots are later used in On the Waterfront."
"1517","tt0042832","4932","22","In fact Panic In The Streets is about people not squealing when they really should in their own best interest."
"1518","tt0042832","4932","23","Very similar again to On the Waterfront."
"1519","tt0042832","4932","24","Panic In The Streets does everyone proud who was associated with it."
"1520","tt0042832","4932","25","Now why couldn't Elia Kazan get some decent New Orleans sounding people in the small roles."
"1521","tt0042832","4933","1","Refreshing `lost' gem!"
"1522","tt0042832","4933","2","Featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them."
"1523","tt0042832","4933","3","The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes."
"1524","tt0042832","4933","4","Palance is his usual evil presence."
"1525","tt0042832","4933","5","Widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene, a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a `logical' end, and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary Hollywood."
"1526","tt0042832","4933","6","You know how it will likely end, but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout."
"1527","tt0042832","4933","7","The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see."
"1528","tt0042832","4933","8","The film seems to slow a little past the middle, but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion."
"1529","tt0042832","4934","1","""Panic in the Streets"" is a fairly unknown little movie from director Elia Kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", ""On the Waterfront"" and ""East of Eden""."
"1530","tt0042832","4934","2","Kazan already won an Oscar in 1947, before this movie, so he was not a completely unknown at the time."
"1531","tt0042832","4934","3","Still ""Panic in the Streets"" is mostly a movie that passed under the radar."
"1532","tt0042832","4934","4","The great thing about this movie is the Oscar winning script."
"1533","tt0042832","4934","5","It has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime/film noir elements."
"1534","tt0042832","4934","6","The dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent and gives the movie a feel of reality and credibility."
"1535","tt0042832","4934","7","The cast is fairly unknown especially at the time it was released but it still features Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first movie roles."
"1536","tt0042832","4934","8","Especially Palance impresses as the tough gangster boss, with a very powerful looking face."
"1537","tt0042832","4934","9","Still the movie drags a little at some points."
"1538","tt0042832","4934","10","The movie starts of very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always makes the right decisions in terms of pace and the point of view the story is told from."
"1539","tt0042832","4934","11","Yet, ""Panic in the Streets"" remains a perfectly watchable movie, mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch."
"1540","tt0042832","4934","12","For fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch.8/10"

"1549","tt0042832","4935","9","The engaging plot has not become dated after fifty seven years."
"1550","tt0042832","4935","10","Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive."

"1558","tt0042832","4936","6","While Panic in the Streets is a quality film, it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling my reason for bringing the score down to an eight."
"1559","tt0042832","4936","7","It wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster, police procedural, thriller and even romance."
"1560","tt0042832","4936","8","This is not director Elia Kazan's best work, but saying that is a bit disingenuous."
"1561","tt0042832","4936","9","Kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire 1951, On The Waterfront 1954 and East of Eden 1955, after all."
"1562","tt0042832","4936","10","This film predates those, but Kazan has said that he was already ""untethered"" by the studio."
"1563","tt0042832","4936","11","Taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl."
"1564","tt0042832","4936","12","The film is set in New Orleans, a city where Kazan ""used to wander around . . . night and day so I knew it well""."
"1565","tt0042832","4936","13","He wanted to exploit the environment."
"1566","tt0042832","4936","14","""It's so terrific and colorful."
"1567","tt0042832","4936","15","I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints all of New Orleans""."
"1568","tt0042832","4936","16","Kazan handles each genre of Panic in the Streets well, but they could be connected better."
"1569","tt0042832","4936","17","The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods."
"1570","tt0042832","4936","18","The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked."
"1571","tt0042832","4936","19","Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, ""Quarantine"" and ""Some Like 'Em Cold""."
"1572","tt0042832","4936","20","The gangster material, which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film, is probably the highlight."
"1573","tt0042832","4936","21","Not surprisingly, Kazan has said that he believes the villains are ""more colorful I never had much affection for the good guys anyway."
"1574","tt0042832","4936","22","I don't like puritans""."
"1575","tt0042832","4936","23","A close second is the only material that approaches the ""panic"" of the title the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed, inoculate them and contain the disease."
"1576","tt0042832","4936","24","While there is plenty of suspense during these two ""moods"", much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama, with pacing more typical of that genre."
"1577","tt0042832","4936","25","The dialogue throughout is excellent."
"1578","tt0042832","4936","26","The stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced."
"1579","tt0042832","4936","27","It is intelligent, delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character."
"1580","tt0042832","4936","28","Conflict isn't created by ""dumb"" decisions but smart moves; events and characters' actions are more like a chess game."
"1581","tt0042832","4936","29","When unusual stances are taken, such as Reed withholding the plague from the newspapers, he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions, which other characters argue over."
"1582","tt0042832","4936","30","In light of this, it's interesting that Kazan believed that ""propriety, religion, ethics and the middle class are all murdering us""."
"1583","tt0042832","4936","31","That idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm, or allowances away from it, made by the protagonists."
"1584","tt0042832","4936","32","For example, head gangster Blackie Jack Palance in his first film role is offered a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card if he'll cooperate with combating the plague."
"1585","tt0042832","4936","33","The technical aspects of the film are fine, if nothing exceptional, but the real reasons to watch are the performances, the intriguing scenario and the well written dialogue."
"1586","tt0042832","4937","1","This film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio terrorism, and the threats of superbugs, West Nile Virus, and SARS."
"1587","tt0042832","4937","2","As a thriller, the tension is fairly intense."
"1588","tt0042832","4937","3","Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than serviceable in their roles."
"1589","tt0042832","4937","4","The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot."
"1590","tt0042832","4937","5","The actor in this film who most left his mark is Jack Palance."
"1591","tt0042832","4937","6","His sharply defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface."
"1592","tt0042832","4937","7","The chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today."
"1593","tt0042832","4937","8","Recommended, 7/10."
"1594","tt0042832","4938","1","Panic In The Streets opens in high noir style, a view along a dark street followed by a camera tilt upwards to a window, behind which is playing out a sleazy card game an opening flourish which, along with some of the location shooting, anticipates some of the atmosphere Welles brought a decade later in Touch Of Evil."
"1595","tt0042832","4938","2","One of the players throws open the window; it's an appropriate action, serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworld."
"1596","tt0042832","4938","3","Shot in high contrast black and white, Panic In The Streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in New Orleans."
"1597","tt0042832","4938","4","Scenes set in such places as the mortuary, the crowded shipping office or amidst the peeling paint of 'Frank's Place' offer a unique, and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere, impossible to recreate in the studio."
"1598","tt0042832","4938","5","With these elements, Kazan's film shows the influence of Dassin's groundbreaking Naked City of two years earlier, which established the gritty, almost documentary style within the noir cycle."
"1599","tt0042832","4938","6","In fact, Widmark's previous role had been in Dassin's even finer Night And The City, a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent."
"1600","tt0042832","4938","7","Joe MacDonald, a favourite with the director, photographed Panic In The Streets' detailed environment."
"1601","tt0042832","4938","8","MacDonald also worked on Kazan's Pinky and Viva Zapata!, and went on to shoot Widmark again three years later in Fuller's masterpiece Pick Up On South Street."
"1602","tt0042832","4938","9","As others have noticed, in a manner typical of some noir films, Kazan's work offers a contrast between the confusion, sickness and immorality of the streets with the modest, calm home life of the Reeds."
"1603","tt0042832","4938","10","But whereas for instance in Lang's The Big Heat 1953 the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the embattled central character ultimately sending him back to work with an increased vigilance and sense of vengeance Panic In The Streets places Reed's rising anxiousness within the confines of what amounts to just another working 'day'."
"1604","tt0042832","4938","11","Despite all the danger, ultimately he returns back to the bosom of his family justified and satisfied."
"1605","tt0042832","4938","12","The implication being that social balance has been restored, at least for the moment by his professionalism and curative skills."
"1606","tt0042832","4938","13","That imbalance of course, has been created by crime and disease."
"1607","tt0042832","4938","14","The two are closely associated in this film."
"1608","tt0042832","4938","15","It reminds one of the tagline from the much cruder Cobra 1986 where ""Crime is the disease."
"1609","tt0042832","4938","16","Meet the cure,"" a neat analogy in context, if one which rings too uncomfortably of social reductionism."
"1610","tt0042832","4938","17","At its climax, as Blackie attempts to flee aboard ship, the visuals specifically allude to rats as being similar to criminals, both posing a menace to society's health."
"1611","tt0042832","4938","18","As the presumably infected Blackie prowls round the cheap rooms and the docks with his cronies, in search of something he suspects everyone is after, if without knowing exactly what it is, 'plague' and 'Blackie' resonate together in the audiences mind, adding further to connected associations."
"1612","tt0042832","4938","19","Ironically Blackie's hunch about Poldi's unfortunate cousin, that ""he brought something in"" of note is correct even if, finally, its nothing he can sell or steal."
"1613","tt0042832","4938","20","Blackie's logical assumption that the police would not normally bother with the murder of some anonymous illegal immigrant has a ring of truth about it, and his so confusion is understandable."
"1614","tt0042832","4938","21","Dr Reed, although home loving, and on the side of society, is a true noir hero."
"1615","tt0042832","4938","22","Familiar to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man who walks alone, forced to travel beyond the limits of the law."
"1616","tt0042832","4938","23","In his way, Reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society at large a dimension of the film that is particularly apposite, given director Kazan's controversial personal history."
"1617","tt0042832","4938","24","The director testified before the infamous HUAC, naming suspected communists and fellow travellers."
"1618","tt0042832","4938","25","His film depicts suspects being hauled in for questioning, and the manhandling of the press, on the grounds that the overriding public good justified the means."
"1619","tt0042832","4938","26","These actions perhaps echo the director's sentiments at the time, presumably accepting the McCarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights it entailed in the light of presumed communist infiltration of the entertainment industry."
"1620","tt0042832","4938","27","In these times of terrorist threats and state response, such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modern."
"1621","tt0042832","4938","28","Standout scenes in the film include a notable scene where Blackie interrogates the dying Poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin's presumed contraband."
"1622","tt0042832","4938","29","Cat like, Blackie stalks his victim across the room, eventually preying over the doomed man's sick bed, holding Poldi's feverish head in his hands a striking, evil cradling."
"1623","tt0042832","4938","30","It's a gesture emphasising the intimate nature of corruption, whether moral or physical."
"1624","tt0042832","4938","31","Apparently, the actors did many or all of their own stunts, which leads to some other, very dramatic scenes at the end, as the police and health authorities close in on the villains under the wharfs."
"1625","tt0042832","4938","32","Half crawling, half scrambling over the slippery timbers at the edge of the dock pool must have been an experience very uncomfortable for Palance, but it is sequence that adds immensely to the immediacy of it all."
"1626","tt0042832","4938","33","Occasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer."
"1627","tt0042832","4938","34","Apparently Dr Reed is left to fight a potential national emergency little government backup."
"1628","tt0042832","4938","35","Perhaps just as astonishingly, he never inoculates himself inviting a dramatic turn which never materialises."
"1629","tt0042832","4938","36","At the end of the film, too, the potential epidemic has been halted, all contactees located, a little too neatly."
"1630","tt0042832","4938","37","But these weaknesses are more than outweighed by the other satisfactions of a film that still makes for compulsive and relevant viewing today."
"1631","tt0046187","4187","1","This is a pretty decent example of film noir."
"1632","tt0046187","4187","2","The setting is the early 50's with the Communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the US Government."
"1633","tt0046187","4187","3","Richard Widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples."
"1634","tt0046187","4187","4","He gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing A List about him."
"1635","tt0046187","4187","5","The interesting thing was that he was not only an anti hero but through most of the film, an unlikeable anti hero."
"1636","tt0046187","4187","6","That is not very normal."
"1637","tt0046187","4187","7","Jean Peters gave a so so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold."
"1638","tt0046187","4187","8","That great character actress Thelma Ritter shines as the stool pigeon."
"1639","tt0046187","4187","9","The plot had its fair share of twists and turns, wisecracks and tough talk."
"1640","tt0046187","4187","10","There is a fight scene near the end of the movie in the subway station that was pretty gritty and exciting."
"1641","tt0046187","4187","11","I think noir fans like myself will enjoy this film."
"1642","tt0046187","4187","12","For non noir viewers, it may seem a little dated and the whole Commie thing a tad overdone."
"1643","tt0046187","4188","1","Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films."
"1644","tt0046187","4188","2","While ""Shock Corridor"" and ""The Naked Kiss"" represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of America and ""The Big Red One"" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, ""Merrill's Marauders"" painted war as necessary hell and ""Pickup on South Street"" is about the dangers of communist spies."
"1645","tt0046187","4188","3","All of his films make for very entertaining viewing, and even though he was often pigeonholed as a b filmmaker, Fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors."
"1646","tt0046187","4188","4","""Pickup on South Street"" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the film making style is remarkably ahead of its time."
"1647","tt0046187","4188","5","Its also a very quickly pace, tight, and occasionally brutal film noir."
"1648","tt0046187","4188","6","The acting across the board is fantastic."
"1649","tt0046187","4188","7","Richard Widmark makes for a great anti hero and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend."
"1650","tt0046187","4188","8","The show stealer is Thlema Ritter however, in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie."
"1651","tt0046187","4188","9","The angles Fuller employs are great, making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal this is very violent for its time."
"1652","tt0046187","4188","10","The camera continuously moves around just as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later."
"1653","tt0046187","4188","11","""Pickup on South Street"" is a great action paced noir thriller."
"1654","tt0046187","4188","12","""Shock Corridor"" remains my favorite Fuller film, but this is a very close second."
"1655","tt0046187","4188","13","8/10"
"1656","tt0046187","4189","1","Richard Widmark is a tainted character in this movie."
"1657","tt0046187","4189","2","He is a professional pickpocket."
"1658","tt0046187","4189","3","He's been in prison three times, yet at the beginning of the film, he tries to make it four."
"1659","tt0046187","4189","4","Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody."
"1660","tt0046187","4189","5","Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark."
"1661","tt0046187","4189","6","This is a period piece during the McCarthy era where the Red Scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely."
"1662","tt0046187","4189","7","What is unusual about this film is that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films."
"1663","tt0046187","4189","8","This is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film."
"1664","tt0046187","4189","9","The film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as the under card for double features in the theater."
"1665","tt0046187","4189","10","The sets show it is a limited budget film."
"1666","tt0046187","4189","11","The script made J Edgar Hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift."
"1667","tt0046187","4189","12","Hoover wanted it changed."
"1668","tt0046187","4189","13","Instead, it became a B under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953."
"1669","tt0046187","4189","14","The script & acting in it are better than other big features were that year."
"1670","tt0046187","4190","1","Thelma Ritter did steal the picture."
"1671","tt0046187","4190","2","I just finished watching it again."
"1672","tt0046187","4190","3","I couldn't help becoming emotional in her final scene."
"1673","tt0046187","4190","4","She didn't get the Oscar."
"1674","tt0046187","4190","5","That's why you shouldn't put too much faith in Oscars."
"1675","tt0046187","4190","6","Richard Widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3 D, flawed human being."
"1676","tt0046187","4190","7","Jean Peters was great as the streetwise, tough girl in her best role ever."
"1677","tt0046187","4190","8","And Richard Kiley must have been very good; why else would I have hated him so."
"1678","tt0046187","4190","9","Yes, it was heavy handed on the patriotism; but, without it, you don't have much of a film."
"1679","tt0046187","4190","10","Watch their faces!"
"1680","tt0046187","4190","11","The top three stars didn't really need much script."
"1681","tt0046187","4190","12","I would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue."
"1682","tt0046187","4190","13","If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in ""The Thief"", maybe you know what I mean."
"1683","tt0046187","4190","14","When I was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to NYC, I made my Bronx uncle drive us to the foot of South Street looking for No."
"1684","tt0046187","4190","15","66."
"1685","tt0046187","4190","16","That's when I knew that Hollywood couldn't be trusted."
"1686","tt0046187","4190","17","But I did find the river."
"1687","tt0046187","4190","18","I'm not giving away much of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it for myself."
"1688","tt0046187","4190","19","If you have seen it, no elucidation is necessary."
"1689","tt0046187","4190","20","Just maybe, someone who is reading these comments hasn't seen ""Pickup On South Street""."
"1690","tt0046187","4190","21","You will like it; just don't go looking for 66 South Street in New York City."
"1691","tt0046187","4191","1","This 1953 Sam Fuller movie contains some of his best work, and its sad that he couldn't continue to get the backing of major Hollywood studios to do his stuff."
"1692","tt0046187","4191","2","The story line goes something like this."
"1693","tt0046187","4191","3","A tough hard broad read prostitute is riding the subway one hot summer day, and gets her pocketbook picked by Skip McCoy."
"1694","tt0046187","4191","4","What Skip and the dame don't realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spies."
"1695","tt0046187","4191","5","This opening shot without dialogue, and mostly in tight close ups is a beaut,one of the many that Fuller uses throughout the movie."
"1696","tt0046187","4191","6","Playing the babe known as Candy is Jean Peters, who was never better nor better looking."
"1697","tt0046187","4191","7","One forgets how beautiful she was, and she handles this role very well."
"1698","tt0046187","4191","8","The Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark, who had already made his mark, and set his style with 1947's Kiss Of Death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh, and although he's a little ""softer"" here, he's still scary."
"1699","tt0046187","4191","9","These hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there, but its noir and nasty all the way."
"1700","tt0046187","4191","10","The standout performance belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter,who plays Moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral."
"1701","tt0046187","4191","11","Ritter received a well deserved Oscar nomination for her performance, but lost out to the boring but popular performance of Donna Reed as the B girl read prostitute in ""From Here To Eternity."""
"1702","tt0046187","4191","12","Hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad, and loves to Oscar them even though their performance is usually awful."
"1703","tt0046187","4191","13","See for instance Shirley Jones in ""Elmer Gantry."
"1704","tt0046187","4191","14","Set among the docks and dives of New York City, with crisp black and white photography by the great Joe MacDonald,and some very good art direction."
"1705","tt0046187","4191","15","Especially good is the set representing the New York City subways and Widmark's shack near the river."
"1706","tt0046187","4191","16","Made at the height of the cold war and red scare, the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie, played by Richard Kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal American."
"1707","tt0046187","4192","1","In what will probably find itself on my list of Fuller's best movies that is, once I see more of them that just this and Shock Corridor, Pickup on South Street is a film noir where the femme fatale, as well as the male protagonist, are not the stereotypical ones in the genre."
"1708","tt0046187","4192","2","Like most of his other works, Fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of New York style that is usually absent in the Hollywood noirs."
"1709","tt0046187","4192","3","On a small budget at least for the likes of Darryl F."
"1710","tt0046187","4192","4","Zanuck Fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere."
"1711","tt0046187","4192","5","The good guys are basically the ones who won't get violent with you even as they're looking for an extra buck."
"1712","tt0046187","4192","6","Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter are all terrific in the lead parts."
"1713","tt0046187","4192","7","Widmark is one only a few actors I can think of who could've really pulled off this character."
"1714","tt0046187","4192","8","He's a little like Bugs Bunny, as he can be a wise ass who is a little sneaky."
"1715","tt0046187","4192","9","On the other hand, the character of Skip McCoy does have a set of values in his life."
"1716","tt0046187","4192","10","He doesn't go into other people's affairs, and doesn't try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river, after being sent away for three years."
"1717","tt0046187","4192","11","He slips up, unbeknownst to him, when he pickpockets a woman Peters on the train, and lifts an item that's under the eye of the Government."
"1718","tt0046187","4192","12","It may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money."
"1719","tt0046187","4192","13","But at what cost is the centerpiece of the film, as it involves stoolie Moe Ritter is one of the finest, and most believable, character actors from the period, the woman's ex a volatile Kiley, and the police department."
"1720","tt0046187","4192","14","Aside from the thematic elements, which are told with a keen dramatic, journalistic style as was Fuller's previous position, along with boxer, the dialog is fresh and involving."
"1721","tt0046187","4192","15","There's a spontaneity in many of Fuller's camera moves."
"1722","tt0046187","4192","16","And what a third act."
"1723","tt0046187","4192","17","This is a lean, tight film noir that is worth checking out even if you're not familiar with Fuller it's comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works."
"1724","tt0046187","4193","1","Director Sam Fuller has something of a cult following, particularly in Europe."
"1725","tt0046187","4193","2","Yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable."
"1726","tt0046187","4193","3","He did however direct one really terrific movie in ""Pickup on South Street""."
"1727","tt0046187","4193","4","Made pretty early on in his career, the movies that followed were vastly inferior."
"1728","tt0046187","4193","5","From the first to the last frame, ""Pickup"" works on all levels."
"1729","tt0046187","4193","6","It's filmed with flawless fluidity, boasting fine performances all round."
"1730","tt0046187","4193","7","Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances, are at their peak."
"1731","tt0046187","4193","8","Widmark, who was no stranger at playing villains, while truly mean to the core, still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making Jean Peters character's falling for him all the more credible."
"1732","tt0046187","4193","9","Fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie."
"1733","tt0046187","4193","10","There is a scene in which Jean Peters get roughed up by Widmark."
"1734","tt0046187","4193","11","It's truly shocking in its reality."
"1735","tt0046187","4193","12","This is not a case of carefully choreographed photography."
"1736","tt0046187","4193","13","Less self conscious than many film noir's of the period this remains a great example of the genre."
"1737","tt0046187","4194","1","Samuel Fuller brings his customary playful and stylish direction to this seedy, pulpy story and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of 1950s cinema."
"1738","tt0046187","4194","2","Richard Widmark plays a petty thief tough guy a role he perfected over the course of many movies, who snatches a young lady's Jean Peters wallet on a New York subway and with it a piece of much wanted microfilm."
"1739","tt0046187","4194","3","This is 1953, so of course the microfilm is property of Commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back."
"1740","tt0046187","4194","4","When the girl shows up at Widmark's waterfront shack, sent by an abusive boyfriend to reclaim the film, Widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her ""comrades"" down for big money."
"1741","tt0046187","4194","5","The plot thickens, people start dying, and Widmark and Peters fall in love."
"1742","tt0046187","4194","6","Fuller handles the love story clumsily, but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction."
"1743","tt0046187","4194","7","It's as if he included a love story under duress, and so made it intentionally unbelievable, as love stories so frequently were and still are in Hollywood films."
"1744","tt0046187","4194","8","Peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough New Yawk cookie, part gangster moll and part damsel in distress."
"1745","tt0046187","4194","9","When violence occurs against her, we genuinely care about her well being, and it's typical of Fuller's renegade, ahead of his time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion."
"1746","tt0046187","4194","10","But the ultimate success of ""Pickup on South Street"" rests squarely on the world weary shoulders of Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, a feisty lady who makes money any way she can, whether that be selling neckties or acting as a police informant."
"1747","tt0046187","4194","11","Ritter gives the performance of her career; in a breathtaking monologue, she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad trajectory of her character's life, and the hopelessness she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle, crime and hardship."
"1748","tt0046187","4194","12","It's as if every character Ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to vent in those other movies."
"1749","tt0046187","4194","13","The scene is the highlight of Fuller's film, and a highlight of 50s cinema, period."
"1750","tt0046187","4194","14","Grade: A+"
"1751","tt0046187","4195","1","This film is a spicy little piece of film making from Sam Fuller which gives Richard Widmark the chance to show of some of his best, most edgy acting in the role of Skip McCoy, a small time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful Candy's Jean Peters pocket on a crowded bus."
"1752","tt0046187","4195","2","It turns out Candy was doing a favor for her ex.boyfriend, who's working for the ""commies""."
"1753","tt0046187","4195","3","Superficially, there's a mystery here regarding Candy's motives and Skip spends much of the film determining her motives ."
"1754","tt0046187","4195","4","Actually he seems to just initially assume that she's a ""commie"", going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture."
"1755","tt0046187","4195","5","But the real question is  what's going on with Skip."
"1756","tt0046187","4195","6","What are his motives, and why does Candy like him so much."
"1757","tt0046187","4195","7","Why do we the audience want to like him so much."
"1758","tt0046187","4195","8","Basically what the film makers have done here is create a very striking ""male fatale"" in Widmark's character and his performance."
"1759","tt0046187","4195","9","Just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like ""The Big Sleep"" or ""The Glass Key"" along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face, the film makers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers."
"1760","tt0046187","4195","10","Widmark is handsome, and there's also a charm in his boyish insouciance  but the first two times he meets our leading lady, he robs her and then punches her in the face."
"1761","tt0046187","4195","11","Eventually the question becomes  would Skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck his comments to the police, like ""you're waving a flag at ME."" make us suspect he would or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend Moe Thelma Ritter."
"1762","tt0046187","4195","12","I'm not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way."
"1763","tt0046187","4195","13","Thelma Ritter's character work deserves special mention  she has created a truly indelible character here."
"1764","tt0046187","4195","14","Fuller isn't afraid to give her plenty of ""business""  in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world, particularly her used ties."
"1765","tt0046187","4195","15","Another example of Fuller's ""business"" would be the scene with Victor Perry an actor I've seen elsewhere used to less effect using the chopsticks to intimidate Candy."
"1766","tt0046187","4195","16","The emphasis on Moe's relationship with Skip provides one of cinema's most revealing ""honor among thieves"" themes."
"1767","tt0046187","4195","17","In fact Skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police, with the notable exception of Capt."
"1768","tt0046187","4195","18","Tiger Murvyn Vye who has a grudge against him."
"1769","tt0046187","4195","19","I loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack."
"1770","tt0046187","4195","20","Those are the kind of details that make this film feel real  whether or not it really is ""realistic"" or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions."
"1771","tt0046187","4195","21","All told, I would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the ""film noir"" school of film making."
"1772","tt0046187","4195","22","A predictable plot is off set by a host of colorful characters uniformly well performed, cheap sets are disguised by the film's unrelenting pace, and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is."
"1773","tt0046187","4195","23","This is the best film I've seen so far by Sam Fuller and helps me to see better why he's regarded as a master director  here he accomplished some things that I think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like ""The Crimson Kimono"" and ""Shock Corridor"" as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense."
"1774","tt0046187","4195","24","This is one of my favorite performances from Widmark that I've seen so far  and Widmark was a talent that I'm tempted to say based on the few extraordinary films I've seen with him was comparable to that of Alan Ladd or Humphrey Bogart, although arguably he didn't make as many classic films."
"1775","tt0046187","4196","1","This crime thriller is sort of like a film noir, though changes the context from post war to Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity."
"1776","tt0046187","4196","2","In ""Pickup on South Street"", policemen are good guys, criminals are genuine guys, and the only enemies are ""The Commies"", who are ultimately differentiated from the good guys in that they are emotionally personable, driven by an actual care for their own worth, as shown in the constant tracked in close ups that speckle the movie."
"1777","tt0046187","4196","3","This movie revolves around characters."
"1778","tt0046187","4196","4","The personalities in this film are rather unique and detailed: Skip the pick pocket who is able to stare down any danger, and sometimes while going through their personal possessions; Moe the informer who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of nearly all the other characters and the audience; Candy, the ill named innocent girl who only thinks she's doing government work and doesn't fully comprehend the conspiracy she's involved with; and Joey, the ex boyfriend evil Commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everybody and, ironically, is the worst person at doing it."
"1779","tt0046187","4196","5","Throw in a bunch of very colorful supporting characters such as the guy with the chopsticks and the policemen and ""Pickup on South Street"" treats you to a splendor of personalities as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames."
"1780","tt0046187","4196","6","PolarisDiB"
"1781","tt0046187","4197","1","'Shock Corridor 1963' was my first film from Samuel Fuller, and there I was impressed with the director's astute blending of B movie and big budget aesthetics, even if the story itself was pure schlock."
"1782","tt0046187","4197","2","'Pickup on South Street 1953' was released a decade earlier in Fuller's career, obviously produced on a larger budget from a big name studio, Twentieth Century Fox."
"1783","tt0046187","4197","3","Nevertheless, the visuals are still notable in that there's a somewhat raw, naturalistic element to the photography, not unlike Dassin's 'The Night and the City 1950' and Kazan's 'Panic in the Streets 1950' the latter was also shot by cinematographer Joe McDonald."
"1784","tt0046187","4197","4","In some scenes, Fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors' faces that they're out of focus, bluntly registering the intimate thoughts, emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features, the eye."
"1785","tt0046187","4197","5","Though unexpectedly prone to melodrama, and with just a hint of anti Communist propaganda, 'Pickup on South Street' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of New York City."
"1786","tt0046187","4197","6","When just out of prison pickpocket Skip McCoy Richard Widmark snags the purse of a woman on the subway Jean Peters, he pockets more than he'd originally bargained for."
"1787","tt0046187","4197","7","The woman, Candy, and her cowardly ex boyfriend Joey Richard Kiley had been smuggling top secret information to the Communists, and McKoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro film."
"1788","tt0046187","4197","8","Will he turn in the MacGuffin to the proper authorities, or sell it to the highest bidder."
"1789","tt0046187","4197","9","If 'Pickup on South Street' has a flaw, it's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti Communist agenda, reeking of propaganda like nothing since WWII Dwight Taylor, who supplied the story, also notably wrote 'The Thin Man Goes Home 1944,' the only propagandistic movie of the series."
"1790","tt0046187","4197","10","For no apparent reason, every identifiable character  even the smugly self serving Skip McCoy  eventually becomes a self sacrificing patriot, the transformation predictable from the outset."
"1791","tt0046187","4197","11","In traditional film noir, the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance, the rational punishment for his sins, but apparently not when they've served their country; patriotism wipes the slate clean."
"1792","tt0046187","4197","12","Richard Widmark, an actor who I'm really beginning to like, plays the haughty pickpocket with composure, though always with that hint of ill ease that suggests he's biting off more than he can chew."
"1793","tt0046187","4197","13","The opening scene on the train is the film's finest, as McCoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim's hand bag, recalling Bresson's 'Pickpocket 1959.'"
"1794","tt0046187","4197","14","Thelma Ritter is terrific as a tired street woman who'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it though, of course, she draws the line at Commies."
"1795","tt0046187","4197","15","Jean Peters is well cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side, playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour; Fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow legged strut of a prostitute."
"1796","tt0046187","4197","16","Nevertheless, Peters must suffer a contrived love affair with Widmark that really brings down the film's attempts at realism."
"1797","tt0046187","4197","17","Fascinatingly, upon its release, 'Pickup on South Street' was promptly condemned as Communist propaganda by the FBI, and the Communist Party condemned it for being the exact opposite."
"1798","tt0046187","4197","18","Go figure."
"1799","tt0046187","4198","1","From the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work RICHARD WIDMARK stealing from a woman's purse JEAN PETERS, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is relentlessly fascinating to watch."
"1800","tt0046187","4198","2","Partly it's because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast, the B&W photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters, and because Samuel Fuller's direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like John ASPHALT JUNGLE Huston."
"1801","tt0046187","4198","3","In fact, it has the same urgency as the Huston film about a heist that goes wrong but the payoff is not quite as strong."
"1802","tt0046187","4198","4","JEAN PETERS is excellent as the hard edged girl whom Widmark describes as being ""knocked around a lot""."
"1803","tt0046187","4198","5","She gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a micro film in her purse for her boyfriend RICHARD KILEY, something the FBI already knows about."
"1804","tt0046187","4198","6","They're on her trail when the theft occurs."
"1805","tt0046187","4198","7","THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman called ""Moe"" who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life."
"1806","tt0046187","4198","8","She's particularly touching in her final scene with Kiley."
"1807","tt0046187","4198","9","This one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time."
"1808","tt0046187","4198","10","Good noir from Fox and notable for the performances of Widmark, Peters and Ritter."
"1809","tt0046187","4199","1","The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive."
"1810","tt0046187","4199","2","It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter."
"1811","tt0046187","4199","3","Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much."
"1812","tt0046187","4199","4","That's the case here for an 80 minute black and white, mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography wise."
"1813","tt0046187","4199","5","The story is the story here as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc. as a pickpocket Widmark inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. say that three times!."
"1814","tt0046187","4199","6","Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant."
"1815","tt0046187","4199","7","She and Widmark are the stars of this film."
"1816","tt0046187","4199","8","Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her."
"1817","tt0046187","4199","9","Only in world of film!!"
"1818","tt0046187","4199","10","Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it."
"1819","tt0046187","4199","11","This an average film noir which means good, but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25 $35."
"1820","tt0046187","4199","12","For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market."
"1821","tt0046187","4200","1","Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: A ""Red Scare"" movie devoid of hysteria, in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot."
"1822","tt0046187","4200","2","Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm; unbeknownst to either of them, it harbors secrets vital to the Cold War."
"1823","tt0046187","4200","3","Peters, as it happens, was under surveillance by FBI agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who's running her, cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley."
"1824","tt0046187","4200","4","In trying to retrieve the precious film, both sides enlist the help of Thelma Ritter, a streetwise old jane who's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears."
"1825","tt0046187","4200","5","Fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story, which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality."
"1826","tt0046187","4200","6","From the subways to the waterfront, his midsummer Manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that's almost pungent."
"1827","tt0046187","4200","7","The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender, and they're scored to ""Again,"" a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House, also starring Widmark."
"1828","tt0046187","4200","8","The pace slackens for Ritter's beautifully written and played death scene among the most poignant vignettes in all noir, and a kind of mirage oasis in a film parched of sentimentality."
"1829","tt0046187","4200","9","This is writer/director Fuller's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle; his later explorations of American pathology The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld U.S.A. never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street."
"1830","tt0046187","4201","1","Pickup on South Street 1953, directed by movie maverick Samuel Fuller, contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication."
"1831","tt0046187","4201","2","Subway rider Candy Susan Peters collides with pickpocket Skip McCoy Richard Widmark dipped in shades of Sinatra cool."
"1832","tt0046187","4201","3","She's unaware that she carries valuable microfilm; McCoy is unaware of grifting it."
"1833","tt0046187","4201","4","Both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents."
"1834","tt0046187","4201","5","Thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges."
"1835","tt0046187","4201","6","Candy is doubly watched Skip and the police and therefore doubly naive; Skip, the overconfident petty thief, is singularly unaware, trailed by federal agents; the feds, all knowing, are ultimately helpless."
"1836","tt0046187","4201","7","They can't stop the ""passing"" of government secrets or the spread of communism."
"1837","tt0046187","4202","1","Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's Cold War influenced low budget noir vehicles."
"1838","tt0046187","4202","2","With a running length of under 80 minutes, PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is tough, gritty, explosive and endlessly entertaining."
"1839","tt0046187","4202","3","Widmark stars as pickpocket Skip McCoy, who has already been picked up three times."
"1840","tt0046187","4202","4","Yet McCoy can't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster's moll Candy Jean Peters."
"1841","tt0046187","4202","5","Candy's wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the Communist movement, and it's her last job for ex boyfriend Richard Kiley to make the delivery."
"1842","tt0046187","4202","6","However, when Widmark lifts it, Peters must do whatever it takes to re claim the film she initially knows nothing about."
"1843","tt0046187","4202","7","It's a tasty set up, with Widmark's character, while not the psycho of KISS OF DEATH, a real live wire, unpredictable and tough, yet curiously charming."
"1844","tt0046187","4202","8","When Bogart or Mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get: a lone anti hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end Bogart, or an overly laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap Mitchum."
"1845","tt0046187","4202","9","With Widmark you just don't know what you are going to get, and with his incredibly modern acting style his films always hold up well he is amazing to watch."
"1846","tt0046187","4202","10","Here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film, or handing it over to the police and fighting the ""Commies"" on the right side of the law."
"1847","tt0046187","4202","11","And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet."
"1848","tt0046187","4202","12","Peters gets her best role as the moll with a heart of gold Candy."
"1849","tt0046187","4202","13","Widmark's unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with Peters; the gorgeous tramp quickly and rather unbelievably the romance angle is rather rushedfalls under Widmark's spell, yet Widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around."
"1850","tt0046187","4202","14","Peters hard edged beauty, yet lack of over lacquered Hollywood glamour Lana Turner would never have worked well in this role, is a major asset to the film."
"1851","tt0046187","4202","15","Candy is not innocent, yet she's very vulnerable, constantly being passed between and slapped around by men."
"1852","tt0046187","4202","16","Widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face, yet by the final act he's a lot more tender to her after she cops one hell of a going over from Kiley."
"1853","tt0046187","4202","17","The scene in the hospital with Peters and Widmark shouldn't work, but it does."
"1854","tt0046187","4202","18","Thelma Ritter is brilliant as stoolie Moe, well deserving of her Oscar nomination."
"1855","tt0046187","4202","19","Ritter's performance, like everything else in the film, is gritty, real and heartbreakingly honest."
"1856","tt0046187","4202","20","Her death scene is stunning."
"1857","tt0046187","4202","21","Fuller's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting."
"1858","tt0046187","4202","22","Fuller loved a good close up, and PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is full of uncomfortable, cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot."
"1859","tt0046187","4202","23","Fuller isn't afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard Old Hollywood really allowed, yet stunningly pulls away from Ritter's death scene to give the audience maximum impact."
"1860","tt0046187","4202","24","The urban locales and unusual, confronting camera angles give PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET, a bold, uncompromisingly modern look.10/10."
"1861","tt0046187","4203","1","This is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s."
"1862","tt0046187","4203","2","This minimalist and fast working director has something unusual for his earlier films a cast with some stars."
"1863","tt0046187","4203","3","Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of Communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of America and they'll stop at nothing to succeed."
"1864","tt0046187","4203","4","The film starts with Peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents."
"1865","tt0046187","4203","5","They know she is a link in a long espionage chain."
"1866","tt0046187","4203","6","Unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation a small time pickpocket Widmark is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that Peters is carrying."
"1867","tt0046187","4203","7","Widmark thinks it's just another purse he's ransacked only later does he realize the seriousness of what he's stolen."
"1868","tt0046187","4203","8","Now it's Widmark on his own with Commies and the FBI hot on his trail."
"1869","tt0046187","4203","9","Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish."
"1870","tt0046187","4203","10","Although she didn't get top billing, a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter."
"1871","tt0046187","4203","11","This supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon."
"1872","tt0046187","4203","12","Seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady."
"1873","tt0046187","4203","13","As far as the script and directing go, they are very good but with one small exception."
"1874","tt0046187","4203","14","At first, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted."
"1875","tt0046187","4203","15","It's one of the few times on film you'll see a woman punched square in the mouth!"
"1876","tt0046187","4203","16","Now THAT'S tough."
"1877","tt0046187","4203","17","Later, inexplicably, they become amazingly close too close to be believable."
"1878","tt0046187","4203","18","Still, with so much great drama and such an effective Noir like film, this can be overlooked."
"1879","tt0046187","4203","19","See this film."
"1880","tt0046187","4204","1","and anyone who watches this film will agree."
"1881","tt0046187","4204","2","This film was directed in the days when plot, character believability and theme actually mattered."
"1882","tt0046187","4204","3","Jean Peters, Widmark, and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight."
"1883","tt0046187","4204","4","Ritter is in top form as informer ""Moe"" she survives in the Bowery section of NY, acting as a stool pigeon for NYC police."
"1884","tt0046187","4204","5","The only other film in which I have seen Peters is ""Niagara"", and she certainly proves her acting ability here, complete with Brooklyn accent."
"1885","tt0046187","4204","6","Widmark is appropriately menacing, as the anti hero who must discern what the right thing is, despite his need for cash."
"1886","tt0046187","4204","7","The photography is brilliant."
"1887","tt0046187","4204","8","The neon, the subway station though it looks cleaner than the real thing!"
"1888","tt0046187","4204","9","the harbor shack where Widmark lives as a transient."
"1889","tt0046187","4204","10","Excellent use is made of the city, with ""Lightning Louie"" in Chinatown; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop."
"1890","tt0046187","4204","11","10/10."
"1891","tt0046187","4205","1","Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America's great directors."
"1892","tt0046187","4205","2","I'm not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywood's great craftsmen."
"1893","tt0046187","4205","3","But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywood's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music."
"1894","tt0046187","4205","4","During the time he worked for Hollywood studios, he knew how to take an assignment, shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts...on time and on budget."
"1895","tt0046187","4205","5","Pickup on South Street is a case in point."
"1896","tt0046187","4205","6","On the surface it's one more of Hollywood's early Fifties' anti Commie movies, complete with appeals to patriotism, a hard boiled hero and a slimy and copiously perspiring bad guy."
"1897","tt0046187","4205","7","Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut, exciting drama with any number of off kilter twists."
"1898","tt0046187","4205","8","The hero, Skip McCoy, is a three time loser, a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his stripes until the very end."
"1899","tt0046187","4205","9","The girl in the caper, Candy, has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined."
"1900","tt0046187","4205","10","One of the most appealing characters, Moe Williams, is a stoolie."
"1901","tt0046187","4205","11","And in an unusual approach to Hollywood's battle against Commies, the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isn't motivated by anything so ennobling."
"1902","tt0046187","4205","12","He just wants payback for a personal reason, and winds up becoming...at least for now...a good guy."
"1903","tt0046187","4205","13","Plus, all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio."
"1904","tt0046187","4205","14","He had to make do."
"1905","tt0046187","4205","15","Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star, but Jean Peters is a surprise."
"1906","tt0046187","4205","16","She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb, and no better than her boy friends...or her clients...want her to be."
"1907","tt0046187","4205","17","And Richard Kiley, who later would become a two time Tony award winning star on Broadway, is convincingly slippery and cowardly."
"1908","tt0046187","4205","18","It's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us, I mean introduced to us, ""The Impossible Dream"" from Man of La Mancha, More than anything else, this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash, pursued by the Feds and the Commies, moves straight ahead with great economy."
"1909","tt0046187","4205","19","The whole enterprise, with a classic noir look, only takes 80 minutes to tell."
"1910","tt0046187","4205","20","The dialogue, with Fuller as screenwriter, has that party corny, partly pungent hard boiled pulp fiction style."
"1911","tt0046187","4205","21","""That muffin you grifted...she's okay,"" one character says to Skip about Candy."
"1912","tt0046187","4205","22","Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next."
"1913","tt0046187","4205","23","Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams."
"1914","tt0046187","4205","24","All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest, part comedy relief and part sad inevitability."
"1915","tt0046187","4205","25","The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fuller's talents and strengths."
"1916","tt0046187","4205","26","In 2 minutes and 15 seconds, starting right after the credits, Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie, to establish for us what the story is about, and to show us what kind of characters Skip and Candy we're going to be involved with."
"1917","tt0046187","4205","27","And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot, packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us."
"1918","tt0046187","4205","28","Says Glenn Erickson, in my opinion one of the best of movie critics, ""In what should be an inconsequential story, Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up: stiff necked, aggressive self interest that when fully expressed recognizes what's wrong and what's right and isn't afraid to fight for it."
"1919","tt0046187","4205","29","As always in his work, the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort."""
"1920","tt0046187","4205","30","He's right, and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years."
"1921","tt0046187","4206","1","Skip McCoy is a three time loser pick pocket, unable to curb his instincts back on the street, he picks the purse of Candy on a subway train."
"1922","tt0046187","4206","2","What he doesn't realise is that Candy is carrying top secret microfilm, microfilm that is of high interest to many many organisations."
"1923","tt0046187","4206","3","Director Samuel Fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of New York City."
"1924","tt0046187","4206","4","Communist spies and shady government operatives all blend together to make Pickup On South Street a riveting viewing from first minute to the last."
"1925","tt0046187","4206","5","Based around a Dwight Taylor story called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller enthused this adaptation with heavy set political agenda, something that many at the time felt was over done, but to only focus on its anti communist leanings is doing it a big disservice."
"1926","tt0046187","4206","6","Digging a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as any that Fuller has directed, the main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece, a crook and a shallow human being, his heroics are not born out of love for his country, they are born out of his sheer stubborn streak."
"1927","tt0046187","4206","7","It's quite an achievement that Fuller has crafted one of the best anti heroes of the 50s, and i'm sure he was most grateful to the performance of Richard Widmark as McCoy, all grin and icy cold heart, his interplay with the wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent, and is the films heart."
"1928","tt0046187","4206","8","However it is the Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter who takes the acting honours, her Moe is strong and as seedy as the surrounding characters, but there is a tired warmth to her that Ritter conveys majestically."
"1929","tt0046187","4206","9","It's a B movie in texture but an A film in execution, Pickup On South Street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director."
"1930","tt0046187","4206","10","9/10"
"1931","tt0046187","4207","1","Skip McCoy Richard Widmark pick pockets Candy's Jean Peters wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the Communist cause."
"1932","tt0046187","4207","2","She is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact."
"1933","tt0046187","4207","3","However, Skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone's noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and Joey Richard Kiley and Candy who want the microfiche back."
"1934","tt0046187","4207","4","Skip can only be traced through Moe Thelma Ritter who sells information on criminals."
"1935","tt0046187","4207","5","It is made clear to Skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film, but he intends to hold out for a high price."
"1936","tt0046187","4207","6","This leads to Joey hunting after him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who has fallen in love with Skip."
"1937","tt0046187","4207","7","Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss."
"1938","tt0046187","4207","8","Its a well acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away."
"1939","tt0046187","4207","9","Its a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from Joey."
"1940","tt0046187","4207","10","Its a good film."
"1941","tt0046187","4208","1","Every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one."
"1942","tt0046187","4208","2","This also happened in the '50's with quite a few little movies, that not a lot of people have ever heard of."
"1943","tt0046187","4208","3","There are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the '50's that are worth digging out."
"1944","tt0046187","4208","4","""Panic in the Streets"" is another movie like that that springs to the mind."
"1945","tt0046187","4208","5","Both are movies that aren't really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources."
"1946","tt0046187","4208","6","I was really surprised at how much I ended up liking this movie."
"1947","tt0046187","4208","7","It was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed."
"1948","tt0046187","4208","8","Like all 'old' movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and it's characters you're in for a real treat with this movie."
"1949","tt0046187","4208","9","The movie has a really great story that involves espionage, though the movie doesn't start of like that."
"1950","tt0046187","4208","10","It begins as this typical crime thriller with a touch of film noir to it."
"1951","tt0046187","4208","11","But ""Pickup on South Street"" just isn't really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on."
"1952","tt0046187","4208","12","It ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watch."
"1953","tt0046187","4208","13","I also really liked the characters within this movie."
"1954","tt0046187","4208","14","None of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses."
"1955","tt0046187","4208","15","Really humane."
"1956","tt0046187","4208","16","It also especially features a great performance from Thelma Ritter, who even received a well deserved Oscar nomination for."
"1957","tt0046187","4208","17","It has really got to be one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen."
"1958","tt0046187","4208","18","Even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great, original, special little movie that deserves to be seen by more!"
"1959","tt0046187","4208","19","10/10"
"1960","tt0046187","4209","1","""Pickup On South Street"" is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists."
"1961","tt0046187","4209","2","The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing."
"1962","tt0046187","4209","3","The use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality."
"1963","tt0046187","4209","4","Samuel Fuller's style of directing and the cinematography by Joseph MacDonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere."
"1964","tt0046187","4209","5","Ace pickpocket and repeat offender Skip McCoy Richard Widmark gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named Candy Jean Peters on the New York subway."
"1965","tt0046187","4209","6","She was being used by her ex boyfriend Joey Richard Kiley to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her, she was carrying US Government secrets recorded on microfilm."
"1966","tt0046187","4209","7","Two FBI agents had been following Candy and witnessed the theft."
"1967","tt0046187","4209","8","One of the agents continues to tail her back to Joey's apartment and the other, Zara Willis Bouchey, visits Police Captain Dan Tiger Murvyn Vye."
"1968","tt0046187","4209","9","Zara explains that the FBI has been following Candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist group."
"1969","tt0046187","4209","10","In order to identify the pickpocket, Tiger calls in a ""stoolie"" called Moe Thelma Ritter who after being given a precise description of the ""cannon's"" method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects."
"1970","tt0046187","4209","11","Once Tiger sees Skip's name on the list he's immediately convinced that he's the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him."
"1971","tt0046187","4209","12","When Skip is brought into Tiger's office, Zara tells him about the microfilm and Tiger offers to drop any charges if he'll co operate with the investigation."
"1972","tt0046187","4209","13","Skip is flippant and arrogant."
"1973","tt0046187","4209","14","He clearly doesn't trust Tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway."
"1974","tt0046187","4209","15","Joey orders Candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it."
"1975","tt0046187","4209","16","Candy pays Moe for Skip's address and when Skip returns from being questioned by Tiger, he finds Candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money."
"1976","tt0046187","4209","17","When she recovers, Skip demands payment of $25,000 for the microfilm."
"1977","tt0046187","4209","18","She tells Joey about Skip's demand and Joey's boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following evening."
"1978","tt0046187","4209","19","Skip and Candy are attracted to each other and it's because of their uneasy, developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police."
"1979","tt0046187","4209","20","It soon becomes apparent, however, that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct action."
"1980","tt0046187","4209","21","The depictions of Skip, Candy and Moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compelling."
"1981","tt0046187","4209","22","Moe's work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time."
"1982","tt0046187","4209","23","She appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as ""an old clock running down"" and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in Long Island."

"2067","tt0046187","4215","29","Character drives the plot, as it should, and the close ups are used to augment character."
"2068","tt0046187","4215","30","When Skip interrogates Candy, the close up captures the sexual energy between them, belying the hostility of Skip's words."

"2098","tt0046187","4216","2","An example of the directing: When Candy Jean Peters starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in as if it's an alarm going off in her head."
"2099","tt0046187","4216","3","It's not cartoon like it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just ""clicks"" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag."
"2100","tt0046187","4216","4","Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart alec he's really great but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for ""Moe,"" the street peddler/informer, played by Thelma Ritter."

"2105","tt0046187","4216","9","Wonderful stuff."""
"2106","tt0046187","4216","10","Pickup On South Street"" is also one of the few movies where, even though the characters aren't perfect, you do care about them perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape: Skip as a ""three time loser"" and Candy as a youngish woman who has ""knocked around"" a lot."
"2107","tt0046187","4216","11","When these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect, it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human."

"2125","tt0061809","2719","13","The bird lifted Perry to paradise."
"2126","tt0061809","2719","14","Strangely, Perry says that he has an aversion to Nuns, God and Religion."
"2127","tt0061809","2719","15","This echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whom."
"2128","tt0061809","2719","16","The director puts in all sorts of what ifs and only ifs."

"2136","tt0061809","2719","24","But Dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing."
"2137","tt0061809","2719","25","Dick wants the hard cash, the $10,000 he thinks is in the Clutter's safe, which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as Perry's Mexican Treasure."

"2148","tt0061809","2720","1","IN COLD BLOOD has to be ranked as first rate movie making, even if the subject matter is about as grim as it gets in the world of make believe, but film noir fans should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work, based as it is on a true life crime spree."
"2149","tt0061809","2720","2","It opens with Quincy Jones' music under the credits and starkly dramatic views of a highway bus heading toward Kansas City, effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end."

"2188","tt0061809","2722","5","The only complaint is that it is a bit overlong, with the denouement dragged out and somewhat preachy."
"2189","tt0061809","2723","1","IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks."
"2190","tt0061809","2723","2","However, it's also so bent on being realistic, it's sometimes more clinical than entertaining."
"2191","tt0061809","2723","3","Recounting the brutal killing of a Midwest family, author Truman Capote focused on minutia, wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject AND subjects!"

"2200","tt0061809","2724","3","Its exceptionally well made yet forces the viewer to think."
"2201","tt0061809","2724","4","Some have complained not only about the film, but about Truman Capote's source ""non fiction novel"", that the central message is unsubtle."
"2202","tt0061809","2724","5","That may be true, but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity doesn't detract from the film at all."
"2203","tt0061809","2724","6","Its refreshing, especially considering today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to see a film with a convinced political voice unafraid to force the audience to consider its viewpoint."

"2213","tt0061809","2725","1","""In Cold Blood"", adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals."
"2214","tt0061809","2725","2","The film excels as a character study of the killers, particularly trigger man Perry Smith Robert Blake."
"2215","tt0061809","2725","3","The cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease."
"2216","tt0061809","2725","4","Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities."

"2218","tt0061809","2725","6","The rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on."
"2219","tt0061809","2725","7","Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction."
"2220","tt0061809","2725","8","In my opinion, both were excellent, though the script does miscalculate with some ill advised narration in the late stages."
"2221","tt0061809","2725","9","The Oscar nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top notch, as is the editing."
"2222","tt0061809","2725","10","Also worthy of note is the jazzy score by Quincy Jones which secured the last of the film's four Oscar nominations."
"2223","tt0061809","2725","11","Unlike so many other crime films, this one doesn't glamorize violence."
"2224","tt0061809","2725","12","Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them."
"2225","tt0061809","2725","13","Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach."
"2226","tt0061809","2725","14","I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled."
"2227","tt0061809","2726","1","This movie is up there with the all time classics."

"2231","tt0061809","2726","5","My guess is that its a hard movie to find."

"2235","tt0061809","2727","2","Haunting Quincy Jones musical score and terrific acting by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, the killers."
"2236","tt0061809","2727","3","Why Wilson didn't go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me."
"2237","tt0061809","2727","4","The black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch."
"2238","tt0061809","2727","5","The re creation of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination, even more scary than if they had shown the shotgun going off."
"2239","tt0061809","2727","6","The movie was filmed in the actual Clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders."
"2240","tt0061809","2727","7","The movie has a very documentary feel besides the scenes at the actual Clutter home other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores the killers actually went to."
"2241","tt0061809","2727","8","Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie."
"2242","tt0061809","2727","9","Will Geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real Clutter murder jurors portraying themselves as the jury for the movie."
"2243","tt0061809","2727","10","This is a solid movie, scary every time you see it."
"2244","tt0061809","2728","1","Simply one of the best ever!"
"2245","tt0061809","2728","2","Richard Brooks' adaptation of Truman Capote's non fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement."

"2247","tt0061809","2728","4","This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and wasn't even nominated for Best Picture while Dr."
"2248","tt0061809","2728","5","Doolittle was."
"2249","tt0061809","2728","6","Go Figure!"
"2250","tt0061809","2728","7","Although you don't get to know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain staking process of tracking these guys down."
"2251","tt0061809","2728","8","John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey."
"2252","tt0061809","2728","9","There are simply no flaws in this one. 10 out of 10."
"2253","tt0061809","2728","10","Best performance = Scott Wilson with R."
"2254","tt0061809","2728","11","Blake a close second."
"2255","tt0061809","2728","12","Highly recommended!"
"2256","tt0061809","2729","1","I voted excellent for how well the acting was, not for the content."
"2257","tt0061809","2729","2","It still gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie."
"2258","tt0061809","2729","3","Two ex cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison."
"2259","tt0061809","2729","4","During the ride, the tension begins to mount, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation."
"2260","tt0061809","2729","5","After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend."
"2261","tt0061809","2729","6","The blood curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really made my blood run cold and gave me chills."
"2262","tt0061809","2729","7","That the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family."
"2263","tt0061809","2729","8","Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith."
"2264","tt0061809","2729","9","The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote."
"2265","tt0061809","2730","1","I saw this in the theater during it's initial release and it was disturbing then as I'm sure it would still be."
"2266","tt0061809","2730","2","It was the first part of '68 and this was still making the rounds in towns across America and there had recently been a mass murder in my hometown where I saw this where a man went on a shooting rampage."
"2267","tt0061809","2730","3","The freshness of that close to home event combined with this dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience."
"2268","tt0061809","2730","4","It really brought to life the excellent acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson."
"2269","tt0061809","2730","5","I was familiar with the novel based on the true event by Truman Capote and the screenplay and direction by Richard Brooks wove the event and Truman's interpretation into compelling gritty cinematic adaptation."
"2270","tt0061809","2730","6","Music from Quincy Jones effectively scores it's story."
"2271","tt0061809","2730","7","I've only seen this a couple times since."
"2272","tt0061809","2730","8","It was too real."
"2273","tt0061809","2730","9","Almost like being a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers."
"2274","tt0061809","2730","10","I would give this a 9.0 of a possible 10."
"2275","tt0061809","2730","11","Society is so desensitized to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and could be viewed with less effect but to anyone over 50 this will be a hallmark into the examination of the criminal psyche."

"2277","tt0061809","2731","2","I am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years."
"2278","tt0061809","2731","3","She said that Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath no conscience extraordinarily well."
"2279","tt0061809","2731","4","I agree!"
"2280","tt0061809","2731","5","She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself superbly."
"2281","tt0061809","2731","6","I agree!"
"2282","tt0061809","2731","7","What a chilling and tremendous film."
"2283","tt0061809","2731","8","I have seen over 2000 films and would rank this in the top 100."
"2284","tt0061809","2731","9","My lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly."
"2285","tt0061809","2731","10","My only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film."
"2286","tt0061809","2731","11","Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these 2 losers did."
"2287","tt0061809","2732","1","Herbet Clutter, wife Bonnie, and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of Holcomb, Kansas but in the early hours of 14 November 1959 all four were brutally murdered."
"2288","tt0061809","2732","2","Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion."
"2289","tt0061809","2732","3","The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD."
"2290","tt0061809","2732","4","Controversial, shocking, and exceptionally well written, it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day."
"2291","tt0061809","2732","5","The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself."
"2292","tt0061809","2732","6","Filmed in black and white in many of the real life locations, it has a slightly documentary quality, icy and detached and the overall cast is exceptional."
"2293","tt0061809","2732","7","This is the film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly so."
"2294","tt0061809","2732","8","As killer Perry Smith, Blake traps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy; it is a masterful performance from start to finish."
"2295","tt0061809","2732","9","As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less fine."
"2296","tt0061809","2732","10","Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and brings them to the Clutter home only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction."
"2297","tt0061809","2732","11","The centerpiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the Clutter home; actually filmed in the Clutter house itself, it is a spinechilling sequence, horrific and deeply disturbing."
"2298","tt0061809","2732","12","Director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy."
"2299","tt0061809","2732","13","Given the overall power of the film, however, this becomes a trivial annoyance."
"2300","tt0061809","2732","14","Strong stuff and recommended."

"2320","tt0061809","2733","19","His contention being: ""These two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours"" This is a line of logic which would induce me to render a verdict of a conviction if I were to be one of the members of the jury!!"

"2322","tt0061809","2733","21","It was Capote's instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the American public's attention!!"
"2323","tt0061809","2733","22","As it turn out, it was a harbinger of things to come.."
"2324","tt0061809","2733","23","""In Cold Blood"" did just that!!"

"2339","tt0061809","2733","38","In the case of ""In Cold Blood"" it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant, intellectually elevating, and, of course, it goes without saying, ""In Cold Blood"" was utterly spellbinding, as well as a totally remarkable movie!!"
"2340","tt0061809","2734","1","Easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century."
"2341","tt0061809","2734","2","In Cold Blood is brilliant in the simplicity and realism of its storytelling, and absolutely riveting."
"2342","tt0061809","2734","3","Robert Blake walks away with the film."
"2343","tt0061809","2734","4","The story seems to be presented almost entirely from Perry's viewpoint, despite Dick being the leader and planner of the pair."
"2344","tt0061809","2734","5","The viewer will invariable perceive Dick as being more unstable, immature, and generally feel like Perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but for Dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score."
"2345","tt0061809","2734","6","Based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy, In Cold Blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural Kansas family one cold, windy night, because Dick has bought into an age old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in their home."
"2346","tt0061809","2734","7","As ""prosecutor"" a character that isn't given a name in the script, played by Will Geer, so astutely points out, their lives are bought for only $10 a head."
"2347","tt0061809","2734","8","Director Richard Brooks wisely chooses not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until the end of the film, prior to this we only know it has happened and watch the lives of Dick and Perry slowly unravel as they attempt to escape not only being apprehended by law enforcement, but also Perry's own ever escalating sense of impending doom."
"2348","tt0061809","2734","9","He repeatedly makes remarks, ""No one ever gets away with a thing like that,"" and ""I can't help thinking we left something behind that belongs to us."""
"2349","tt0061809","2734","10","Dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime, only irritation at Perry's."
"2350","tt0061809","2734","11","Indeed, after they are caught, it is Dick who breaks first, and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime."
"2351","tt0061809","2734","12","I felt somewhat sorry for Perry from the very beginning of the film, and more so as events progressed, but I only loathed Dick."
"2352","tt0061809","2734","13","The genius of the film is the engaging manner in which the story is played."
"2353","tt0061809","2734","14","We do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters, but that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred."
"2354","tt0061809","2734","15","The story is unrelenting, taunt, the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few minutes."
"2355","tt0061809","2734","16","For those of you who are interested in such things, I noticed a couple of the ""Goofs"" listed here on the IMDb page for In Cold Blood are incorrect or exaggerated."
"2356","tt0061809","2734","17","Such as the ""reversed"" process shot, at the beginning of the film, as Dick and Perry are driving across the bridge into Kansas."
"2357","tt0061809","2734","18","To begin with, this isn't even a process shot, the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield of the car is real."
"2358","tt0061809","2734","19","A large cargo truck located to the left front of Dick's Pontiac creates the optical illusion that they are going backward because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed, but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle."
"2359","tt0061809","2734","20","As I previously stated, this is one of the ten best works of 20th century cinema, not recommended for the very young due to some course language and implied and inferred violence no actual in your face gore as a modern film would resort to, but a thoroughly excellent film."
"2360","tt0061809","2735","1","The actual crime story at the core of In Cold Blood might seem a little 'tame' for those who are weened on the classic serial killer stories Gein, Bundy, Dahmer, or just the more notorious cases out in Hollywood OJ, Manson."
"2361","tt0061809","2735","2","The essential facts in the case don't amount to anything terribly convoluted: Perry Smith and Dick Hickock here played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson respectively met by some luck, conspired to rob a man's farmhouse safe out in Kansas, and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and dagger came away with 43 dollars."
"2362","tt0061809","2735","3","Aside from their returning to the US after fleeing briefly to Mexico, there isn't a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either."
"2363","tt0061809","2735","4","They were caught by some stroke of ironic chance a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after Smith and Hickcock helped out a boy and his old man collecting bottles for change, and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead."
"2364","tt0061809","2735","5","The story ended in 1965."
"2365","tt0061809","2735","6","But it's the handling of the story, moments of moot, the performances, a pure cinematic touch that Brooks and his absolutely marvelous the late/great DP Conrad Hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white, and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama save perhaps for near the end, which is pitch perfect."
"2366","tt0061809","2735","7","The air of tragedy hangs over the story, and not so much because of the killings themselves, no matter how brutal they are as the ""third"" man that is conjured up, as the narrator observes, by Smith and Hickcock teaming up, but because of the inevitability of the story."
"2367","tt0061809","2735","8","You feel somehow for these criminals, who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a B movie."
"2368","tt0061809","2735","9","These aren't good people, but they aren't necessarily monsters either, at least all the way through."
"2369","tt0061809","2735","10","It's also an excellent 'road movie' as we see Smith and Hickcock on the road down to the Clutter residence the actual night time scene of the crime taking place late in the film, then on to Mexico, then back to America towards Las Vegas."
"2370","tt0061809","2735","11","We get to soak in the personalities of these two, probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an inmate."
"2371","tt0061809","2735","12","It's actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two sort of akin to the aimless quality of Malick's Badlands characters, and it's also a sign of daring for the period."
"2372","tt0061809","2735","13","There's no sermonizing, like ""he did this because of that and this or the other."""
"2373","tt0061809","2735","14","We see how Smith had an abusive, psychotic father, but that Smith loved and hated him."
"2374","tt0061809","2735","15","The complexity there is too much for the movie, maybe even too much for Capote's book which, I should confess, I've still yet to read, though I plan to."
"2375","tt0061809","2735","16","And we see Hickcock is this creature of slick confidence i.e. getting the suit and other things with bad checks, but without any deep rooted explanation to it all."
"2376","tt0061809","2735","17","The streak of fatalism in In Cold Blood is some of the starkest of the 60s, and it's the luck of Brooks to have its stars as Blake in his top of the pops performance this and Lost Highway, oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years, his quintessential pieces of work, and Wilson's breakthrough before becoming a character actor."
"2377","tt0061809","2735","18","While they're surrounded by fine supporting work, they themselves are eerily absorbing, driven more or less by greed and fantasies of escapism with treasure, and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends."
"2378","tt0061809","2735","19","Is this a morale of the story, if there could be one, that it's more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill can't be classified, of good vs evil getting smudged."
"2379","tt0061809","2735","20","Smith apologized for his crime before being hung, and he points out, ""but to who."""
"2380","tt0061809","2735","21","This is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of true crime the bonafide chills, and it's quite possibly the best American film of 1967."
"2381","tt0061809","2736","1","A unique film...one of the best of all time."
"2382","tt0061809","2736","2","Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing, etc. just fantastic."
"2383","tt0061809","2736","3","As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas farm family the Clutters by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery."
"2384","tt0061809","2736","4","I've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film."
"2385","tt0061809","2736","5","The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them."
"2386","tt0061809","2736","6","Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing."
"2387","tt0061809","2736","7","Cocky, twitchy, and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming, oily and plausible."
"2388","tt0061809","2736","8","Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well lonely, and at once empathetic and cold blooded."
"2389","tt0061809","2736","9","Who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it."
"2390","tt0061809","2736","10","He does, and it's brilliant!"
"2391","tt0061809","2736","11","A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully."
"2392","tt0061809","2736","12","Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high water marks, and that stands for acting period."
"2393","tt0061809","2736","13","The cops are wonderful too."
"2394","tt0061809","2736","14","Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well."
"2395","tt0061809","2736","15","Unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles, these are just genuine flatfeet, working the case with determination and competence."
"2396","tt0061809","2736","16","They seem so real."
"2397","tt0061809","2736","17","I've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen most of the crime classics going way back."
"2398","tt0061809","2736","18","Really one of a kind in this respect."
"2399","tt0061809","2736","19","PARTIAL SPOILER COMING this movie's unique in that you already know what's happened, but I'm warning for the record."
"2400","tt0061809","2736","20","Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks, Mano a Mano."
"2401","tt0061809","2736","21","This movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film."
"2402","tt0061809","2736","22","Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel, unaware the cops have the goods on them."
"2403","tt0061809","2736","23","But the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions."
"2404","tt0061809","2736","24","This is some of the best acting you'll ever see."
"2405","tt0061809","2736","25","Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating."
"2406","tt0061809","2736","26","To help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story, ICB was filmed at the actual Clutter house, and I've heard the Clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel."
"2407","tt0061809","2736","27","It works."
"2408","tt0061809","2736","28","These seem like decent, simple folk."
"2409","tt0061809","2736","29","It makes the crime so palpable and sad."
"2410","tt0061809","2736","30","I'll stop here."
"2411","tt0061809","2736","31","It's not a feel good movie, but it is one of the best movies ever made, and so unique, it's mandatory viewing for every film buff."
"2412","tt0061809","2737","1","The movie was gripping from start to finish and its b/w photography of the American heartland is stunning."
"2413","tt0061809","2737","2","We feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into Mexico and back to America again."
"2414","tt0061809","2737","3","Near the end of the movie, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face."
"2415","tt0061809","2737","4","In the end, we follow them up the stairway to their final moment."
"2416","tt0061809","2737","5","The two criminals, performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could be seen on any street in any town."
"2417","tt0061809","2737","6","Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town."
"2418","tt0061809","2737","7","This point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else."
"2419","tt0061809","2737","8","Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition."
"2420","tt0061809","2737","9","These two delusional men kill an entire family, looking for a safe that isn't there."
"2421","tt0061809","2737","10","Once on the run, they start writing bad cheques, carving out a trail for the authorities."
"2422","tt0061809","2737","11","There are many fine supporting actors."
"2423","tt0061809","2737","12","I like John Forsyth as the detective on the case, Alvin Dewey."
"2424","tt0061809","2737","13","Also, Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney."
"2425","tt0061809","2737","14","I have often wanted to see this movie all the way through, having only caught it in short snatches; I did finally get to it after buying the DVD."
"2426","tt0061809","2737","15","The result is the finest classic crime movie I have ever seen."
"2427","tt0061809","2737","16","Don't miss this brilliant movie."
"2428","tt0061809","2737","17","To me, this is what great film making is all about."
"2429","tt0061809","2738","1","I haven't seen this in over 20yrs but I still remember things about it."
"2430","tt0061809","2738","2","This film could NOT have been made in color."
"2431","tt0061809","2738","3","The stark grays are what make it, and was life really that simple in the 1950's.."
"2432","tt0061809","2738","4","What stands out the most in my memory is Perry Smith going to the gallows."
"2433","tt0061809","2738","5","His breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap."
"2434","tt0061809","2738","6","I don't think I could watch that again.....once is plenty."
"2435","tt0061809","2738","7","It's like that unnamed guy at the beginning of ""Papillon"" who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine."
"2436","tt0061809","2738","8","The guy that said watch this on a double bill with ""Dead Man Walking"" should have added the last 10 minutes of ""I Want To Live"" as well."
"2437","tt0061809","2738","9","Some of my ancestors being ""aristos"" went to the guillotine in 1794 95 so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense."
"2438","tt0061809","2739","1","Criminals Perry Smith and Richard ""Dick"" Hickock believe Mr."
"2439","tt0061809","2739","2","Clutter of Holcomb, Kansas keeps a large supply of cash on hand in a safe."
"2440","tt0061809","2739","3","On November 15, 1959 at two a.m. they end up murdering Mr. and Mrs."
"2441","tt0061809","2739","4","Clutter and their teenage son and daughter."
"2442","tt0061809","2739","5","After a little police investigation the two men are found and sentenced to be hanged."
"2443","tt0061809","2739","6","In Cold Blood 1967 is directed by Richard Brooks."
"2444","tt0061809","2739","7","Now, I haven't read the Truman Capote novel this movie is based on, so I can't make any comparisons."
"2445","tt0061809","2739","8","The movie does a brilliant job telling of those horrific events that actually took place."
"2446","tt0061809","2739","9","Robert Blake is excellent as Perry."
"2447","tt0061809","2739","10","Of course, Blake had the murder case of his own a few years back, being accused of murdering his wife."
"2448","tt0061809","2739","11","He's free now, but we still don't know the truth."
"2449","tt0061809","2739","12","What ever that may be, he's still a very fine actor."
"2450","tt0061809","2739","13","Scott Wilson does remarkable job as Hickock."
"2451","tt0061809","2739","14","John Forsythe is terrific as Alvin Dewey."
"2452","tt0061809","2739","15","Paul Stewart is very good as Jensen."
"2453","tt0061809","2739","16","Jeff Corey is marvelous as Mr."
"2454","tt0061809","2739","17","Hickock."
"2455","tt0061809","2739","18","Same thing with Charles McGraw who plays Tex Smith."
"2456","tt0061809","2739","19","John McLiam portrays Herbert Clutter, Ruth Storey is his wife Bonnie, Brenda Currin is the daughter Nancy and Paul Hough is the son Kenyon."
"2457","tt0061809","2739","20","Great job by each of them."
"2458","tt0061809","2739","21","There is much to remember from this film."
"2459","tt0061809","2739","22","Let's start from the lighter side."
"2460","tt0061809","2739","23","It's pretty great when Perry wants to go hunting for gold in Mexico and says to Hickock: Remember Bogart in Treasure of the Sierra Madre."""
"2461","tt0061809","2739","24","And Blake himself was in that movie as a boy!"
"2462","tt0061809","2739","25","And it's a fun moment when they, giving a ride to that boy and his granddad, collect bottles and turn them in for refund money."
"2463","tt0061809","2739","26","Those darker moments are the most haunting ones."
"2464","tt0061809","2739","27","The flashback sequence, where you see the murders happening, is extremely terrifying."
"2465","tt0061809","2739","28","When Perry goes to kill the girl, Nancy last, and she says ""Oh, please, don't""..."
"2466","tt0061809","2739","29","The brutality of man, it's impossible to explain."
"2467","tt0061809","2739","30","Then the hanging scene."
"2468","tt0061809","2739","31","First there goes Hickock and then Perry, first talking to the minister."
"2469","tt0061809","2739","32","In the last image of the movie we see Perry hitting the end of the rope."
"2470","tt0061809","2739","33","Sure movies,and books may try to sympathize these villains."
"2471","tt0061809","2739","34","Especially Perry's character is someone you could feel sorry for."
"2472","tt0061809","2739","35","He thinks of his mom, and dad who he hates, but still loves."
"2473","tt0061809","2739","36","But it doesn't change the fact both of these men these actors portray are brutal murderers, who don't feel sorry for anybody."
"2474","tt0061809","2739","37","They go to this house and murder an entire family, in cold blood."
"2475","tt0061809","2739","38","How could you sympathize these people."
"2476","tt0061809","2740","1","Tremendous black and white nighttime cinematography, and plenty of it, highlights this supposedly true life account of a 1950s murder in Kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two men."
"2477","tt0061809","2740","2","The story was written by Truman Capote, so you get the very Liberal anti death penalty message at the end of the film, which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case."
"2478","tt0061809","2740","3","Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family."
"2479","tt0061809","2740","4","Despite the annoying slant at the end, this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating."
"2480","tt0061809","2740","5","Famed photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this."
"2481","tt0061809","2740","6","It makes me wish more modern day films were made in black and white."
"2482","tt0061809","2740","7","See it on DVD.Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here."
"2483","tt0061809","2740","8","My third viewing of this film came in early April of 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife."
"2484","tt0061809","2740","9","One can't help but look at Blake and this film differently after that."
"2485","tt0061809","2741","1","As I have matured, my fascination with the Academy Awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement."
"2486","tt0061809","2741","2","As in a few other comments that I have written, the bizarre results of Academy Award voting are often difficult to explain."
"2487","tt0061809","2741","3","The omission of ""In Cold Blood"" in 1967 as one of the five Best Picture nominees is one of those inexplicable instances, especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable ""Dr."
"2488","tt0061809","2741","4","Dolittle."""
"2489","tt0061809","2741","5","While only an insomniac or masochist would tune in to that Rex Harrison disaster, Richard Brook's powerful adaptation of Truman Capotes non fiction novel retains its ability to capture the viewer's attention and leave him or her completely drained by the final fade out."
"2490","tt0061809","2741","6","While there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen, the film is definitely adult material."
"2491","tt0061809","2741","7","Based on a Nebraska multiple murder in the 1950's and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place, ""In Cold Blood"" was filmed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall in stark black and white, and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio."
"2492","tt0061809","2741","8","Together with Quincy Jones's unsettling score, Hall's work should have been credited above the title with Brook's screenplay as the three pillars on which this intense classic is built."
"2493","tt0061809","2741","9","The performances are fine as well."
"2494","tt0061809","2741","10","Scott Wilson is all cold charm and Robert Blake intense introversion as the two killers."
"2495","tt0061809","2741","11","There is an inside joke at one point when Blake speaks of Bogart and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" while the duo are driving to Mexico."
"2496","tt0061809","2741","12","As a child star, Blake sold the lottery ticket to Bogart in that John Huston film."
"2497","tt0061809","2741","13","The film, like the book, is definitely slanted towards the killers and has an anti capital punishment tilt, although the remorselessness of the murderers somewhat negates that sentiment despite the difficult to watch final scenes."
"2498","tt0061809","2741","14","Some have criticized the film because it does focus on the criminals, their backgrounds, and lives, while the Clutter family, which was literally murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night, come across as one dimensional characters of little import."
"2499","tt0061809","2741","15","This lack of balance comes from the book as Capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row."
"2500","tt0061809","2741","16","The Clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth."
"2501","tt0061809","2741","17","However, whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment, ""In Cold Blood"" will leave you mired deep in conflicting thoughts."
"2502","tt0061809","2741","18","Run a double bill with ""Dead Man Walking,"" and you may not speak for days."
"2503","tt0061809","2742","1","Richard Brooks excellent 1967 film of Truman Capote's novel IN COLD BLOOD is a perfect companion piece to Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar winning performance in the 2005 CAPOTE."
"2504","tt0061809","2742","2","They really play well together try them on separate nights."
"2505","tt0061809","2742","3","It is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well."
"2506","tt0061809","2742","4","These two truly enhance each other."
"2507","tt0061809","2742","5","Even though different actors play the roles of killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces blend well."
"2508","tt0061809","2742","6","Only the part of the writer played by Paul Stewart in the Brooks films is weaker, as they give him a different name then Capote."
"2509","tt0061809","2742","7","I'd suggest watching CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD."
"2510","tt0061809","2742","8","It makes for a powerful experience!"
"2511","tt0061809","2743","1","In the year 2006, ""In Cold Blood"" a riveting thriller from 1967 has two new interesting contexts that it did not previous have."
"2512","tt0061809","2743","2","First, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, Robert Blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife."
"2513","tt0061809","2743","3","Second, the recent Oscar winning biopic, ""Capote"" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author, Truman Capote."
"2514","tt0061809","2743","4","These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience."
"2515","tt0061809","2743","5","As a stand alone film from it's era, ""In Cold Blood"" is top notch in every way."
"2516","tt0061809","2743","6","Most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall later of ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"" fame."
"2517","tt0061809","2743","7","Many of the stills from this film of the Kansas farm house at night or the tree lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography."
"2518","tt0061809","2743","8","Combined with the cracker jack direction from Brooks and superb editing in the early scenes where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers, a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events."
"2519","tt0061809","2743","9","It's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screen."
"2520","tt0061809","2743","10","The film is also anchored nicely by Robert Blake's eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo."
"2521","tt0061809","2743","11","The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done."
"2522","tt0061809","2743","12","Then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last ""confession"" so to speak."
"2523","tt0061809","2743","13","It's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting, superb writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography."
"2524","tt0061809","2743","14","I dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down Robert Blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears."
"2525","tt0061809","2743","15","The only thing hampering ""In Cold Blood"" is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end."
"2526","tt0061809","2743","16","The tacked on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey."
"2527","tt0061809","2744","1","Remarkable, disturbing film about the true life, senseless, brutal murder of a small town family, along with the aftermath, and examination of the lives of the killers, Dick Hickok and Perry Smith."
"2528","tt0061809","2744","2","No matter how much time goes by, or how dated this film may look, it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this."
"2529","tt0061809","2744","3","This really traces multiple tragedies: The tragedy, brutality and senselessness of the murder of the Clutter family, a decent farm family in small town Holcomb, Kansas; and the wasted, brutal and sad lives of Hickok and Smith."
"2530","tt0061809","2744","4","An interesting point is made in the film: that neither of these two immature, scared, petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone."
"2531","tt0061809","2744","5","But, together, they created a dangerous, murderous collective personality; one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them."
"2532","tt0061809","2744","6","They push each other along a road of ""proving"" something to each other."
"2533","tt0061809","2744","7","That they were man enough to do it, to carry it out; neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big ""score""; an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led."
"2534","tt0061809","2744","8","These were two grown up children, who live in a criminal's world of not backing down from dares; who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness. in this instance, these needs carried right through to the murder of the Clutters."
"2535","tt0061809","2744","9","The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the Clutter family, but the point is made."
"2536","tt0061809","2744","10","These were respected, law abiding, small town people, who didn't deserve this terrifying fate."
"2537","tt0061809","2744","11","The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith."
"2538","tt0061809","2744","12","Perry Smith, whose early life was filled with security and love, but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path."
"2539","tt0061809","2744","13","Hickok, poor and left pretty much to his own devices, not able to see how he fit in, using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with."
"2540","tt0061809","2744","14","An interesting, and maybe the first, look at capital punishment, and what ends we hope to achieve."
"2541","tt0061809","2744","15","Is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us, or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these."
"2542","tt0061809","2744","16","Is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit, operating under the radar, believing they fool everyone they come into contact with."
"2543","tt0061809","2744","17","To be deterred, you must believe it's possible you will be caught."
"2544","tt0061809","2744","18","Is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught.; who have committed hundreds of petty crimes, and got away with them."
"2545","tt0061809","2744","19","This was supposed to be a ""cinch"", ""no witnesses""."
"2546","tt0061809","2744","20","When caught, Hickok finds he can't charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks."
"2547","tt0061809","2744","21","Smith, who believes he deserves such a fate anyway, who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done, willingly tells the story when he learns that Hickok has cowardly caved in."
"2548","tt0061809","2744","22","Hickok blinked first."
"2549","tt0061809","2744","23","A silly game of chicken between two immature, emotionally damaged, dangerous men."
"2550","tt0061809","2744","24","Fascinating psychological thriller, telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation's history."
"2551","tt0061809","2744","25","Stunning portrayals by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson."
"2552","tt0061809","2744","26","These roles made their careers."
"2553","tt0061809","2745","1","I've seen a great many films, but 'In Cold Blood' stands alone in a class by itself."
"2554","tt0061809","2745","2","It excels in every department."
"2555","tt0061809","2745","3","The fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story, rather than the name on the marquee."
"2556","tt0061809","2745","4","Blake and Wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo."
"2557","tt0061809","2745","5","The fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place, even inside the very house, add additional chills."
"2558","tt0061809","2745","6","The black/white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent."
"2559","tt0061809","2745","7","There are many outstanding cinematic works out there, but if I could only vote for one to top the list, it would most probably be ""In Cold Blood""."
"2560","tt0061809","2746","1","Imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night, and then going to bed."
"2561","tt0061809","2746","2","There's no need to lock the doors."
"2562","tt0061809","2746","3","The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees."
"2563","tt0061809","2746","4","Sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway."
"2564","tt0061809","2746","5","Moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room."
"2565","tt0061809","2746","6","What makes this image so scary is the setting: a remote farmhouse ... at night."
"2566","tt0061809","2746","7","Based on Truman Capote's best selling book, and with B&W lighting comparable to the best 1940's noir films, ""In Cold Blood"" presents a terrifying story, especially in that first Act, as the plot takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads."
"2567","tt0061809","2746","8","It's the stuff of nightmares."
"2568","tt0061809","2746","9","But this is no dream."
"2569","tt0061809","2746","10","The events really happened, in 1959."
"2570","tt0061809","2746","11","Two con men with heads full of delusions kill an entire Kansas family, looking for a stash of cash that doesn't exist."
"2571","tt0061809","2746","12","Director Richard Brooks used the actual locations where the real life events occurred, even the farmhouse ... and its interior!"
"2572","tt0061809","2746","13","It makes for a memorable, and haunting, film."
"2573","tt0061809","2746","14","Both of the lead actors closely resemble the two real life killers."
"2574","tt0061809","2746","15","Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith, short and stocky with a bum leg, who dreams of finding Cortez' buried treasure."
"2575","tt0061809","2746","16","Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the smooth talking con artist with an all American smile."
"2576","tt0061809","2746","17","After their killing spree, the duo head to Mexico."
"2577","tt0061809","2746","18","Things go awry there, so they come back to the U.S., stealing cars, hitchhiking, and generally being miserable as they roam from place to place."
"2578","tt0061809","2746","19","But it's a fool's life, and the two outlaws soon regret their actions."
"2579","tt0061809","2746","20","The film's final twenty minutes are mesmerizing, as the rain falls, the rope tightens, and all we hear is the pounding of a beating heart."
"2580","tt0061809","2746","21","Even with its somewhat mundane middle Act, ""In Cold Blood"" stages in riveting detail a real life story that still hypnotizes, nearly half a century later."
"2581","tt0061809","2746","22","It's that setting that does it."
"2582","tt0061809","2746","23","Do you suppose people in rural Kansas still leave their doors unlocked ... at night."
"2583","tt0061809","2747","1","Although it was released way back in 1967, IN COLD BLOOD still remains the benchmark by which all true crime films are matched."
"2584","tt0061809","2747","2","Veteran writer/director Richard Brooks ELMER GANTRY adapted Truman Capote's non fiction book into a chilling docudrama that retains a disturbing power even today, thirty five years later."
"2585","tt0061809","2747","3","Robert Blake and Scott Wilson portray Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, two ex cons who, on a tip from Hicock's old cellmate Floyd Wells, broke into the Holcomb, Kansas home of Herbert Clutter, looking for a wall safe supposedly containing $10,000."
"2586","tt0061809","2747","4","But no safe was ever found, and the two men instead wound up killing Mr."
"2587","tt0061809","2747","5","Clutter, his wife, and their two children, getting away with only a radio, a pair of binoculars, and a lousy forty dollars."
"2588","tt0061809","2747","6","Two months on the run, including an aimless ""vacation"" in northern Mexico, ended in Las Vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car."
"2589","tt0061809","2747","7","But it eventually comes out, after merciless grilling by Kansas law enforcement officials, that these two men committed that heinous crime in Holcomb."
"2590","tt0061809","2747","8","Tried and convicted on four counts of murder, they stew in jail over a five year period of appeals and denials until both are hanged to death on April 14, 1965."
"2591","tt0061809","2747","9","Blake and Smith are absolutely chilling as the two dispassionate killers who show no remorse for what they've done but are concerned about getting caught."
"2592","tt0061809","2747","10","John Forsythe also does a good turn as Alvin Dewey, the chief detective investigating the crime, as does Gerald S."
"2593","tt0061809","2747","11","O'Laughlin as his assistant."
"2594","tt0061809","2747","12","In a tactic that is both faithful to Capote's book and a good artistic gambit all around, Brooks does not show the murders at the beginning; instead, he shows the two killers pulling up to the Clutter house as the last light goes out, then cuts to the next morning and the horrifying discovery of the bodies."
"2595","tt0061809","2747","13","Only during the ride back to Kansas, when Blake is questioned by Forsythe and narrates the story, do we see the true horror of what happened that night."
"2596","tt0061809","2747","14","We don't see that much blood being spilled in these scenes, but we don't need to."
"2597","tt0061809","2747","15","The shotgun blasts and the horrified look on the Clutters' faces as they know they are about to die are more than disturbing enough, so there is no need to resort to explicitly bloody slasher film violence."
"2598","tt0061809","2747","16","Brooks wisely filmed IN COLD BLOOD in stark black and white, and the results are excellent thanks to Conrad Hall's expertise."
"2599","tt0061809","2747","17","The chilling jazz score by Quincy Jones is the capper."
"2600","tt0061809","2747","18","The end result is one of the most unsettling films of any kind ever made, devastating in its own low key fashion."
"2601","tt0061809","2747","19","It is a 134 minute study of a crime that shook an entire state and indeed an entire nation, and should be seen, though viewer discretion is advised; the 'R' rating is there for a reason."
"2602","tt0089374","4582","1","I do find it a bit overrated."
"2603","tt0089374","4582","2","Maybe it's just because I've never seen a subtitled version dubbing stinks!, but I just don't get into it like a lot of other people do."
"2604","tt0089374","4582","3","The finale is really great though as Jackie trashes a mall, a scene that plays in my head every time i go shopping!"
"2605","tt0089374","4583","1","I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles."
"2606","tt0089374","4583","2","I thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over acting."
"2607","tt0089374","4583","3","This took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score, which really irked me throughout the entire movie."
"2608","tt0089374","4583","4","If the musical score was improved I could overlook the few overacted scenes."
"2609","tt0089374","4583","5","Then the film would be much, much better."
"2610","tt0089374","4584","1","I have not seen each and every one of Chan´s movies, but this is for sure the best one I have seen so far."
"2611","tt0089374","4584","2","The story in it self is nothing special really, so I won´t go deeper into that."
"2612","tt0089374","4584","3","What makes it special is the stunts, the fighting, the good acting, the warm sense of humor."
"2613","tt0089374","4584","4","The movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it."
"2614","tt0089374","4584","5","All the cool stunts of course made by Jackie himselfmakes you want jump around in the couch and scream."
"2615","tt0089374","4584","6","It´s just awesome!"
"2616","tt0089374","4584","7","Even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it."
"2617","tt0089374","4584","8","I know this Police Story can be a bit hard to get a hold of, at least it is here in Sweden."
"2618","tt0089374","4584","9","But I can assure you, it´s worth a try."
"2619","tt0089374","4585","1","This movie is Jackie's best."
"2620","tt0089374","4585","2","I still cant get enough of watching some of his best stunts ever."
"2621","tt0089374","4585","3","I also like the bad guys in this movie the old man looks like a Chinese version of John Howard."
"2622","tt0089374","4585","4","Unlike some of Jackie's other work, this movie has also got a great story line and i recommend it to all of Jackie's fans."
"2623","tt0089374","4586","1","Jackie Chan's classic directorial feature POLICE STORY 1985 is among the most influential and over the top modern day police actioners ever to come out from Hong Kong."
"2624","tt0089374","4586","2","Jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other ""urban"" action which would later become very popular and typical among HK directors like John Woo and Ringo Lam."
"2625","tt0089374","4586","3","POLICE STORY mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds."
"2626","tt0089374","4586","4","Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a police who gets to protect an important witness Brigitte Lin who would soon testify against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity."
"2627","tt0089374","4586","5","Jackie's girlfriend is played by young and sweet Maggie Cheung, who isn't as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like Heroic Trio and the sequel by Johnnie To, Savior of the Soul by Corey Yuen and David Lai and many many others."
"2628","tt0089374","4586","6","The plot in POLICE STORY is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place."
"2629","tt0089374","4586","7","Jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes, some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which Jackie hits his head near the eye through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass."
"2630","tt0089374","4586","8","Also Jackie's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film."
"2631","tt0089374","4586","9","The scene in which a bus stops right before Jackie, spitting the kidnappers through the windshield, went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen didn't fly as they were supposed to."
"2632","tt0089374","4586","10","They were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries."
"2633","tt0089374","4586","11","During the end credits, there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless, but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely."
"2634","tt0089374","4586","12","The action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by action director Chan."
"2635","tt0089374","4586","13","The now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the wildest scenes any action film has been able to deliver."
"2636","tt0089374","4586","14","Jackie always tells how important editing is which is true and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra kinetic when compared to Hollywood efforts, for instance."
"2637","tt0089374","4586","15","There's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch."
"2638","tt0089374","4586","16","But there is again one negative point which I cannot stand in HK action comedies, which is this comedy itself."
"2639","tt0089374","4586","17","The comedy isn't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay aren't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there, without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue."
"2640","tt0089374","4586","18","I mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare, and he is there to ""murder"" that girl."
"2641","tt0089374","4586","19","This kind of acting is stupid and inept and I wouldn't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre."
"2642","tt0089374","4586","20","Characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those ""loud thoughts"" are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and ""light."""
"2643","tt0089374","4586","21","Even if the film is comic and not so serious, these kind of stupidities should not be there and they cannot be forgiven too easily."
"2644","tt0089374","4586","22","POLICE STORY is a fast speed, full impact, balls to the walls action adventure miracle from Hong Kong and from the time when Jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the US produced The Protector as he didn't have the same thoughts about the film as director James Glickenhaus had and thus the result didn't please audiences and Jackie and he returned to Hong Kong to make more personal and inventive film."
"2645","tt0089374","4586","23","That he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80's."
"2646","tt0089374","4586","24","This is among the most insane action films ever, and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws I mentioned."
"2647","tt0089374","4586","25","7/10"
"2648","tt0089374","4587","1","Although John Woo's hard Boiled is my number 1 favorite movie."
"2649","tt0089374","4587","2","But i have to say police story is my number 2 favorite movie."
"2650","tt0089374","4587","3","I say this because the stunts, the fights and the action my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps off the rail at the top of the esculator at the mall grabs on to a pole surrounded with Chrismas lights and slid down the pole fell through a skylight and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor."

"2657","tt0089374","4588","2","Quebec Rating:13+should be G Canadian Home Video Rating:14AI have seen Police Story a couple of times now."
"2658","tt0089374","4588","3","In my opinion Police Story is Chan's best film from the 80's."
"2659","tt0089374","4588","4","He originally made it because he didn't like the other cop film he had to star in which was The Protector."
"2660","tt0089374","4588","5","I have not seen the protector so I cant compare."
"2661","tt0089374","4588","6","The acting isn't too bad and the plot is pretty good."
"2662","tt0089374","4588","7","I don't remember the plot well because I saw this film a while back but what I do remember is this film has lots of great action,stunts and comedy just what a good Chan film needs."
"2663","tt0089374","4588","8","If you can find Police Story and you are Chan fan then buy this film!"
"2664","tt0089374","4588","9","Runtime:106min 9/10"
"2665","tt0089374","4589","1","Well, I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan's best film."
"2666","tt0089374","4589","2","The plot, the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent."
"2667","tt0089374","4589","3","In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui Kevin Chan in some versions who successfully arrested a crime lord."
"2668","tt0089374","4589","4","After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer."
"2669","tt0089374","4589","5","Due to this, he became wanted by the police."
"2670","tt0089374","4589","6","Later on, Salina Brigitte Lin, who was the secretary of the crime lord, went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to Chan."
"2671","tt0089374","4589","7","However, the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her."
"2672","tt0089374","4589","8","Later on, Chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen, defeating them one by one."
"2673","tt0089374","4589","9","At the last scene, Chan was seen punching the crime lord."
"2674","tt0089374","4589","10","Lastly, this is the best action and comedy movie."
"2675","tt0089374","4589","11","Everyone should watch it."
"2676","tt0089374","4589","12","Highly recommended."
"2677","tt0089374","4590","1","Maybe the movie itself isn't one of the best Jackie Chan's movies, but I think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made."
"2678","tt0089374","4590","2","There also was some memorable stunts, which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic."
"2679","tt0089374","4590","3","This movie influenced many other action movies and I think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film like they could remake that chase scene, I thing with modern technologies they could make it even better."
"2680","tt0089374","4590","4","There also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie wasn't fighting."
"2681","tt0089374","4590","5","Althou I think they could put more fighting scenes in this film."
"2682","tt0089374","4591","1","It's depressing to see where Jackie Chan has ended up."
"2683","tt0089374","4591","2","He used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible stunts."
"2684","tt0089374","4591","3","To be fair, he's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown."
"2685","tt0089374","4591","4","But with 'Rush Hour 3', where he takes a back seat to Chris Tucker of all people!, and then there's 'Kung Fu Panda' where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue... to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement."
"2686","tt0089374","4591","5","It's times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old VHS tape and watch Jackie kick some arses in his younger, fitter, Chris Tucker free days."
"2687","tt0089374","4591","6","Enter 'Police Story'."
"2688","tt0089374","4591","7","Jackie Chan plays Kar kui, a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial."
"2689","tt0089374","4591","8","He faces resistance from both the unco operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both."
"2690","tt0089374","4591","9","But on the other hand, who cares."
"2691","tt0089374","4591","10","We don't watch Jackie Chan films for the story."
"2692","tt0089374","4591","11","We watch them to see Jackie Chan perform eye popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is."
"2693","tt0089374","4591","12","And on that level, 'Police Story' doesn't disappoint at all."
"2694","tt0089374","4591","13","There is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in Jackie sliding down a giant, high voltage chandelier."
"2695","tt0089374","4591","14","Seriously, if this sort of thing happened more often, no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes."
"2696","tt0089374","4591","15","There is also comedy, much of which involves Kar kui inadvertently upsetting May Maggie Cheung, his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend."
"2697","tt0089374","4591","16","The humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle, but it works so I'm not complaining."
"2698","tt0089374","4591","17","The acting isn't too subtle, either."
"2699","tt0089374","4591","18","Indeed, I'm not sure there was anything subtle about 'Police Story' at all."
"2700","tt0089374","4591","19","Director Jackie Chan yeah, he does that too clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films, and knows that while we're waiting for the next fight to start, the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning."
"2701","tt0089374","4591","20","So 'Police Story' is a blast."
"2702","tt0089374","4591","21","As is the case with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition."
"2703","tt0089374","4591","22","I mean, when Jackie Chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella, a whole new ""Wow!"""
"2704","tt0089374","4591","23","factor is added to the action."
"2705","tt0089374","4592","1","Jackie Chan's Police Story is a landmark film for both the Honk Kong action genre and the career of Jackie Chan."
"2706","tt0089374","4592","2","Directed/written by Chan, Police Story has a basic plot as did all the films of that era and genre, and like most of the the films of Police Storys' kind, the script is nothing to be raved about."
"2707","tt0089374","4592","3","But the plot of the film is Jackie Chan, who plays a nice guy cop, struggling to convict the local gang lord."
"2708","tt0089374","4592","4","The direction of the film is nothing special and by no means the best directing effort that Jackie Chan has given us, that responsibility falls to the underrated masterpiece ""Miracles""."
"2709","tt0089374","4592","5","However the job that Jackie does directing is sufficient and respectable."
"2710","tt0089374","4592","6","The standout out directing of the film comes with the fight scenes."
"2711","tt0089374","4592","7","The performances in this film also vary with Jackie giving a very solid typical Chan nice guy up against it role, but this is by no means his best acting role, that can been seen in the Sammo Hung directed film ""Heart of the Dragon""."
"2712","tt0089374","4592","8","The other actors in the film also give as good a solid performance as Jackie with Bridgete Lin playing her part of the unwilling witness reasonably well, but neither does she display full acting potential."
"2713","tt0089374","4592","9","The standout acting comes from Maggie Cheung as Jackies' suffering girlfriend and Bill Tung as the sympathetic and funny police chief."
"2714","tt0089374","4592","10","None of the performances in this film is of a low enough standard to affect the quality of the film."
"2715","tt0089374","4592","11","The action in the film is what really separates this film from others with stunning contemporary choreography to suit the urbanised, modern setting, the action is some some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on camera."
"2716","tt0089374","4592","12","To begin with there is a shootout in the slum where Koo ganglord is making a drug deal, whilst being no John Woo style sequence, this serves as a nice starter for the film."
"2717","tt0089374","4592","13","This is then followed by the famous car run down the side of the hill and through the heart of the slum wrecking everything in sight."
"2718","tt0089374","4592","14","This is a breathtaking sequence that has since been shamelessly copied by Bad Boys 2."
"2719","tt0089374","4592","15","In the middle of the film is yet another standout sequence as Jackie tries to transport Bridgete Lin from her house to his."
"2720","tt0089374","4592","16","This is really the first scene where we get to see the awesome fast paced hand to hand combat that has since become the norm for all modern set martial art films."
"2721","tt0089374","4592","17","This sequence is fantastically choreographed, timed and seamlessly edited together to maximise the brutality of the scene."
"2722","tt0089374","4592","18","However, as tradition dictates, the standout fight sequence is at the end of the film."
"2723","tt0089374","4592","19","This sequence displays some of Chans' best choreography, stunts and camera/editing work."
"2724","tt0089374","4592","20","This sequence is now famous for two things, the amount of people sent through high density glass, which has to be said a phenomenal amount of people, and the stunt at the end where Jackie leaps from a 5th storey balcony, grabs hold of a pole and slides down through a glass roof this has to be seen to be believed."
"2725","tt0089374","4592","21","Whilst the two for mentioned factors are both uniquely brilliant, i think that the most impressive part of this fight sequence is Chans' ability to incorporate anything into the fight sequence and the sheer originality of the choreography, that for me has never been bettered."
"2726","tt0089374","4592","22","I also believe that the action in Police Story is some of the best filmed and edited action of Chans career helping to set the action apart from others."
"2727","tt0089374","4592","23","Overall, Police Story, despite its unspectacular storyline and script and over running in the middle due to plot padding, is one of the best action films of all time displaying Chans best choreography, best filmed action and arguably his most spectacular stunt making this essential viewing for everyone."
"2728","tt0089374","4592","24","Afterall, we watch a Chan movie for the action!!"
"2729","tt0089374","4593","1","Police Story is one of Jackie Chan's classic films that helped shape the Hong Kong cinema."
"2730","tt0089374","4593","2","It is a masterpiece that should not be missed by any action movie fan."
"2731","tt0089374","4593","3","From the beginning it is obvious that Jackie Chan's stunt team literally risked their live to make this film."
"2732","tt0089374","4593","4","Both the action and the stunts are extremely realistic and innovative."
"2733","tt0089374","4593","5","Even today, no movie has outdone police story in dangerous stunts."
"2734","tt0089374","4593","6","Many people were hospitalized in Police Story including Jackie Chan."
"2735","tt0089374","4593","7","The fighting is not as indisputably exceptional as the stunts but the fighting in this movie helped change and define Jackie Chan's use of props."
"2736","tt0089374","4593","8","Throughout the film Chan uses odd object to stop attackers and is constantly throwing assailants through thick glass."
"2737","tt0089374","4593","9","The action feels real because the stuntmen are giving the movie all they have to give and Jackie Chan's coordination is outstanding."
"2738","tt0089374","4593","10","The rest of the aspects of the film are not without flaws but they will not disappoint any action fan."
"2739","tt0089374","4593","11","Chan not only plays a believable risk taking cop but shows the powerful changes that his character goes through as he falls into escalating desperation."
"2740","tt0089374","4593","12","The plot is powerful but a modern viewer may find it tedious at times."
"2741","tt0089374","4593","13","While the comedy will provide a good number of laughs it does not always distract the audience from the lack of action."
"2742","tt0089374","4593","14","However, for the time period it was made in, the driving aspects of the plot are entertaining."
"2743","tt0089374","4593","15","There a good number of interesting and well played characters dispersed throughout the film as well."
"2744","tt0089374","4593","16","Overall police story is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever made."
"2745","tt0089374","4593","17","And even in Hollywood the influences of this one film are not to be ignored."
"2746","tt0089374","4594","1","The best martial arts movie ever made."
"2747","tt0089374","4594","2","This one movie is better than anything Bruce Lee ever did."
"2748","tt0089374","4594","3","A classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax."
"2749","tt0089374","4594","4","Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu."
"2750","tt0089374","4594","5","It's a great pity that whilst Bruce Lee had been so overrated, it took Jackie Chan an eternity to become popular in Europe and America."
"2751","tt0089374","4594","6","Jackie rules!!!!"
"2752","tt0089374","4595","1","Jackie Chan name is synonomus to stunts."
"2753","tt0089374","4595","2","This movie never let you down."
"2754","tt0089374","4595","3","The opening best chase scene and last roll down scene from the pole is so risky than one wonder ,if he knows the meaning of fear."
"2755","tt0089374","4595","4","This movie comes very close to Jackie's best which is PROJECT A.But the main difference being that PROJECT A contains three stars where as in this movie Jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders."
"2756","tt0089374","4595","5","This is perhaps the main reason that this movie made jackie an biggest martial arts star followed by Bruce Lee."
"2757","tt0089374","4595","6","The film has nice comic touches too."
"2758","tt0089374","4595","7","What makes this film work is Jakie's ability to show his venerable side which his in contract to the typical martial arts action hero."
"2759","tt0089374","4595","8","This movie was followed by a sequel which was good but was quite tame in comparison to its predecessor."
"2760","tt0089374","4596","1","This is Jackie Chan's best film, and my personal favourite."
"2761","tt0089374","4596","2","After the disappointing U.S made 'The Protector' directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into Hong Kong."
"2762","tt0089374","4596","3","This is also probably Jackies most violent movie, with the audience cringing at the bone breaking stunts."
"2763","tt0089374","4596","4","The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design."
"2764","tt0089374","4596","5","Bones were broken and blood spilt in the process of making this film as you'll see in the credits."
"2765","tt0089374","4596","6","The script is a simple cops and robbers affair, nothing special, after all it was written around the action."
"2766","tt0089374","4596","7","I must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing, but it shouldn't put you off too much."
"2767","tt0089374","4596","8","So, get the lads round, crack open the beers and enjoy."
"2768","tt0089374","4596","9","By the way, the film was nicknamed 'Glass Story' by the stunt crew."
"2769","tt0089374","4596","10","Why."
"2770","tt0089374","4596","11","I'll let you find out for yourself!!"
"2771","tt0089374","4597","1","Having first achieved fame with Drunken Master, Jackie Chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983's Project A, a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re established him as a major star."
"2772","tt0089374","4597","2","By the time Police Story was released two years later, the extraordinary hype surrounding Jackie was reaching its zenith, and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts, brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy."
"2773","tt0089374","4597","3","It broke numerous box office records and inspired a 50% rise in police recruits, but, viewed 20 years on is it any good."
"2774","tt0089374","4597","4","As an action movie Police Story unquestionably stands up."
"2775","tt0089374","4597","5","There are several terrific fight scenes, some stuntwork that recalls the very best of Chan's hero Buster Keaton, and a compelling if over violent climactic tussle."
"2776","tt0089374","4597","6","Jackie's performance is also very strong, and whilst the frequent forays into laboured comedy dull the film's impact just a little, his charisma carries it through."
"2777","tt0089374","4597","7","Furthermore, in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger, Jackie took a momentous gamble ... though in the event nobody seems to have noticed!"
"2778","tt0089374","4597","8","By praising Police Story as a simple 'Good vs."
"2779","tt0089374","4597","9","Evil' battle critics belittled the film's ambiguity of tone, and whilst it's hardly The Brothers Karamazov, in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas."
"2780","tt0089374","4597","10","In short, this remains a quality ""popcorn"" movie though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the film's final scene a potent, boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period."
"2781","tt0089374","4598","1","This is one of Jackies best films that is him without opera buddies Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao it has one of the best openings in any action film and it carrys on in that way with Jackie showing some high quality stunts the only critisim is that in the middle it gets a bit slow but it shows up for a frantic last 25 mins in the film and the end credits show what a crazy fool jackie chan is just to keep us film addicts happy"
"2782","tt0089374","4599","1","This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie and in an interview, Jackie said it was his favorite as well."
"2783","tt0089374","4599","2","It contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well."
"2784","tt0089374","4599","3","This movie was a favorite of Brandon Lee, who used parts in Rapid Fire, and was also lifted in Tango and Cash, which used some of the opening scenes."
"2785","tt0089374","4599","4","Jackie plays a policeman in Hong Kong."
"2786","tt0089374","4599","5","The story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a shanty town and continues as Jackie slides down a hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil Ku who is one of the greatest villains in any Jackie Chan movie."
"2787","tt0089374","4599","6","You can expect some very funny scenes as Jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girl friend, played by Maggie Chung."
"2788","tt0089374","4599","7","His job is to protect Ku's secretary who has enough information to take him down, but even that poses many problems."
"2789","tt0089374","4599","8","Jackie is at his absolute best here."
"2790","tt0089374","4599","9","The last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone period."
"2791","tt0089374","4599","10","It was the most intense fight I have ever seen Jackie do and climaxes in a slide down a pole amidst exploding lights."
"2792","tt0089374","4599","11","All in all, one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin pealed off his hands."
"2793","tt0089374","4599","12","He was fortunate he was not electrocuted as the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of a lower voltage."
"2794","tt0089374","4599","13","All in all, another Chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies."
"2795","tt0089374","4599","14","By the end of this movie, you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen."
"2796","tt0089374","4599","15","So many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie that nobody would insure them anymore Jackie had to take responsibility himself."
"2797","tt0089374","4599","16","There are no gimmicks, wires or stand ins it is all true life action that is a treat to watch."
"2798","tt0089374","4599","17","It is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will amaze people 100 years from now."
"2799","tt0089374","4599","18","If you have not seen this movie and are a fan of Jackie Chan or action in general, give yourself a treat and watch this movie."
"2800","tt0089374","4599","19","It is truly sensational."
"2801","tt0089374","4600","1","This is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here."
"2802","tt0089374","4600","2","This is still the best Action movie ever done."
"2803","tt0089374","4600","3","The action movies of today are badly done The actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly. only some no how to do it mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan."
"2804","tt0089374","4600","4","The stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever."
"2805","tt0089374","4600","5","The start where Chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing."
"2806","tt0089374","4600","6","The end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film."
"2807","tt0089374","4600","7","The end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass Jackie was badly hurt."
"2808","tt0089374","4601","1","Police Story is a stunning series of set pieces for Jackie Chan to show his unique talents and bravery."
"2809","tt0089374","4601","2","Some of the stunts here are among Jackie's best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably Jackie's greatest single fight sequence, more brutal and less comedic then say Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impact."
"2810","tt0089374","4601","3","But unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements."
"2811","tt0089374","4601","4","I always prefer JC in films such as Project A where his natural comic talents shine through."
"2812","tt0089374","4601","5","In the serious confines of some elements of Police Story it just doesn't work for me."
"2813","tt0089374","4601","6","Having said that though this is still up there with Jackies best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectacle."
"2814","tt0089374","4601","7","As usual with Hong Kong films avoid the English dubbed DVD version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitles."
"2815","tt0089374","4601","8","Great stunts, OK movie a fine starting point if you've not seen a JC movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 7/10"
"2816","tt0089374","4602","1","Police story brought Hong Kong movies to modern day cinema."
"2817","tt0089374","4602","2","Jackie plays a policeman who tries to catch some drug dealers and at the same time take care of a young woman from the bad guys, and still take care of his relationship with his girlfriend Selina Brigitte Lin."
"2818","tt0089374","4602","3","The movie features plenty of stunts, not only from Jackie, but also from other actors who are now in Jackies stunt club."
"2819","tt0089374","4602","4","Three of Jackie's stunt members went to hospital during filming on the film."
"2820","tt0089374","4602","5","The movie also have some incredible fights scenes like ''the car park fight'' and ''the shoppingmal fight ranks as one of Jackie's finest."
"2821","tt0089374","4602","6","The movie also won award for best movie and best action design by Jackie Chan at Hong Kong film awards."
"2822","tt0089374","4602","7","Everyone who loves Jackie Chan and/or martial art movies shud see this"
"2823","tt0089374","4603","1","There is one detail, which is not very common for Jackie Chan movies, but which is present here."
"2824","tt0089374","4603","2","It has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too."
"2825","tt0089374","4603","3","Jackie is menacing and psychotic here."
"2826","tt0089374","4603","4","He is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back in a usual laid back pattern, but he is the one who can go and start the tumult."
"2827","tt0089374","4603","5","His manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing."
"2828","tt0089374","4603","6","Every time it goes ""crack!""."
"2829","tt0089374","4603","7","I also especially enjoy the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend."
"2830","tt0089374","4603","8","It's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen."
"2831","tt0089374","4603","9","Besides, the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall it also looks like a poster of ""rabochiy"" from our Soviet era and some lines in Russian on the left I noticed that quite accidentally."
"2832","tt0089374","4603","10","That looks terrific and nostalgic for Russian people."
"2833","tt0089374","4603","11","I also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies."
"2834","tt0089374","4603","12","Here there's a lot of this stuff."
"2835","tt0089374","4603","13","It's quite amazing watching the characters falling/jumping/running/driving through all manner of panes."
"2836","tt0089374","4603","14","All three movies are great."
"2837","tt0089374","4603","15","I had been preparing myself to see the down slide of the quality but I saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts and not only Jackie Chan's character appears in all three movies that's also excellent and keeps continuity up."
"2838","tt0089374","4603","16","I would like to describe each movie just in a few words: No.1 great in all aspects it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end and funny many scenes are ridiculous; No.2 raging Jackie is really beep off here and painful Jackie gets tortured; No.3 unbelievable the woman that fights alongside with Jackie is incredible and bombastic should I mention a lot of guns and explosions.."
"2839","tt0089374","4603","17","As to the rest much has been mentioned by the others."
"2840","tt0089374","4603","18","It's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again at least by me."
"2841","tt0089374","4603","19","Its place is in top 10 among action/comedy jewels."
"2842","tt0089374","4603","20","Finally it's been released in Russia on DVD the 2nd film has the best options the Chinese/Russian soundtracks and English/Russian subtitles."
"2843","tt0089374","4603","21","Solid 10 out of 10."
"2844","tt0089374","4603","22","Thank you for attention."
"2845","tt0089374","4604","1","This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10.. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no ""good plot"" or anything like that, thats ridiculous, saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot!"
"2846","tt0089374","4604","2","you watch Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES, for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other American films from that era and even later you will realize that Jackie Chan's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while American movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time."
"2847","tt0089374","4604","3","Porn is watched for the porn, Jackie Chan is watched for the ACTION, i think you people are rating it bad because there's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained."
"2848","tt0089374","4604","4","Sure the middle of the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that."
"2849","tt0089374","4604","5","This did change the way how American action movies were created, they have even stollen scenes from this movie."
"2850","tt0089374","4604","6","If you want a true man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan's, hes pure in everyway."
"2851","tt0089374","4604","7","He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park, and even in TODAYS movies."
"2852","tt0089374","4604","8","American movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more."
"2853","tt0089374","4604","9","Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece"
"2854","tt0089374","4605","1","This is not only one of the greatest Jackie Chan films, but also one of the greatest kung fu movies of all time."
"2855","tt0089374","4605","2","We've come to expect crazy stunts, and fast, creative action in Chan's movies, and this one set the benchmark for others to follow."
"2856","tt0089374","4605","3","It's two hours of pure entertainment, that impresses all the way through."
"2857","tt0089374","4605","4","As well as the superb action, we have a viable storyline and believable characters, with Chan taking what appears to be a more western approach to the writing, mixing eastern resolution methods ie kicking ass."
"2858","tt0089374","4605","5","Overall, it's funny, serious, entertaining and groundbreaking."
"2859","tt0089374","4605","6","A must for any kung fu fan, whilst at the same time remaining accessible to the wider reaches of the film community."
"2860","tt0089374","4606","1","Police Story is arguably one of the best works by the master of action himself."
"2861","tt0089374","4606","2","Compared to other action films,Police Story makes Schwarzenegger and Stallone look like beginners."
"2862","tt0089374","4606","3","The stunt scenes are well cheorgraphed and the action scenes are superb."
"2863","tt0089374","4606","4","If New Line Cinema has any sense,they would release this in theaters."
"2864","tt0089374","4607","1","My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be ""Drunken Master"" 1978, followed by this film from 1985, ""Police Story."""
"2865","tt0089374","4607","2","In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend Brigitte Lin so that she can turn state's evidence."
"2866","tt0089374","4607","3","As the story goes on, the gangster sends his goons to dispatch Lin, but Chan takes matters into his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung at bay."
"2867","tt0089374","4607","4","Like ""Drunken Master,"" ""Police Story"" has many of the signature stunts and over the top martial arts/action choreography that Chan has become famous for, climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall."
"2868","tt0089374","4607","5","In his role as director, Chan exceeds in excellence, giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action."
"2869","tt0089374","4607","6","While light on the overall slapstick humor of ""Drunken Master,"" at heart ""Police Story"" is just that, a police story, a gritty cop thriller that would be oft copied over the years to come.10/10"
"2870","tt0089374","4608","1","Jackie Chan is considered by many film and martial arts movie fans as one of the greatest action stars ever to grace the silver screen and Police Story cemented his reputation as the likely successor to the late, great Bruce Lee."
"2871","tt0089374","4608","2","If Enter The Dragon bared the so called bench mark of Lee's greatness in the 70s, then the same can be said about Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 80s."
"2872","tt0089374","4608","3","Forget about the Rush Hour trilogy, or any of his US efforts the one film that really typifies Chan's excellence, not to mention kick starting his status as a high kicking, bone crushing kung fu talisman, as well as his movie career was this, Police Story the first in a series of successful cop films, set in mainland, present day Hong Kong."
"2873","tt0089374","4608","4","I've seen many of his efforts likewise the US based Rush Hour, Rumble in the Bronx, The Medalian and The Tuxedo to name and frankly many of them pale into insignificance compared to Police Story."
"2874","tt0089374","4608","5","In those movies, we saw a less 'dumbed down' version of Jackie, of whom didn't get the opportunity to utilise his fighting abilities to the maximum, not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as Drunken Master, Police Story to name."
"2875","tt0089374","4608","6","The stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie."
"2876","tt0089374","4608","7","The shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and has to be seen to be believed: the flying shards of glass, Chan who is left dangling outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman frantically drives through the streets of the town, and Chan successfully making usage of all sorts of inanimate objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with."
"2877","tt0089374","4608","8","Considering he is known for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in harm's way, Jackie's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one, is somewhat of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert."
"2878","tt0089374","4608","9","Especially as he has the bruises to show for it."
"2879","tt0089374","4608","10","Thus, he has proved that he is no one trick pony when it comes down to devising and coming up with various and clever looking moves."
"2880","tt0089374","4608","11","Story wise, there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative, it makes up with its end to end action and fight sequences."
"2881","tt0089374","4608","12","As for the dialogue, well it's not a really huge aspect of the film which is why most fans of Jackie's and martial arts films are more interested in action, as opposed to the story."
"2882","tt0089374","4608","13","Unlike say The Matrix, there are no wires or CGI, or any form of computer trickery involved."
"2883","tt0089374","4608","14","What you see is what you get and what you get with Police Story is a great Jackie Chan epic, full of action and pulsating stunts."
"2884","tt0089374","4608","15","It is miles better than Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour and all his other American efforts."
"2885","tt0089374","4608","16","Police Story is an excellent film and one I'd definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice Jackie Chan fan, but of whom are unsure which one they should watch first."
"2886","tt0089374","4609","1","Probably Jackie Chan's best film in the 1980s, and the one that put him on the map."
"2887","tt0089374","4609","2","The scale of this self directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes, during which a squatters' village and shopping mall are demolished."
"2888","tt0089374","4609","3","There are, clearly, differences between the original Chinese and dubbed English versions, with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter."
"2889","tt0089374","4609","4","The latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their Chinese originals."
"2890","tt0089374","4609","5","In fact, the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trialat the time, trials in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English, while the original has this scene in Cantonese!"
"2891","tt0089374","4609","6","Nonetheless, Chan's fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible, so non Cantonese audiences don't miss much."
"2892","tt0089374","4609","7","It's not, after all, the dialogue that makes a Chan flick, but the action and the painful out takes."
"2893","tt0089374","4609","8","The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather Cho Yeun, and assigned to protect a star witness Brigitte Lin."
"2894","tt0089374","4609","9","The action is superb from beginning to end, and there's not much time to breathe in between."
"2895","tt0089374","4609","10","It'll never get you thinking, but what an entertaining, and well strung together, film."
"2896","tt0089374","4609","11","Arguably, this is one of the best martial arts films out there."
"2897","tt0089374","4610","1","A winters day, 28th December 1986, two bored 14 year olds hire a movie."
"2898","tt0089374","4610","2","""Hmmmm, Police Story, looks interesting"", ""who is this Jackie Chan."", ""never heard of him""."
"2899","tt0089374","4610","3","Two hours later after watching the film, in a daze, we wanted to know more. 16 years later and severely out of pocket from collecting JC movies!"
"2900","tt0089374","4610","4","the film still grabs me like no other."
"2901","tt0089374","4610","5","Ok, maybe I have a soft spot for it as it was my ""first"" Cannonball Run doesn't count!!"
"2902","tt0089374","4610","6","JC movie, but it is an excellent movie."
"2903","tt0089374","4610","7","It has all the classic JC elements, Action, Humour, Action, Heart and ACTION!"
"2904","tt0089374","4610","8","Some comments say it's dated, it was made in 1985, of course it's dated!"
"2905","tt0089374","4610","9","But then so must Jaws, Casablanca, Singin' in the Rain and The Godfather!!!!!!"
"2906","tt0089374","4610","10","Without movies like Police Story where would Hollywood action be today."
"2907","tt0089374","4610","11","PS set standards, many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies."
"2908","tt0089374","4610","12","To really fully appreciate it you must see it in widescreen, you miss so much of the movie otherwise yes, he really does fall off the bus going round the corner!."
"2909","tt0089374","4610","13","If you haven't already, SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!"
"2910","tt0089374","4611","1","Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release."
"2911","tt0089374","4611","2","Cantonese / English subtitlesOnce upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with 'The Matrix', and I was perhaps one of the few fifteen year olds left who still believed that 'Terminator' was better than 'Matrix'."
"2912","tt0089374","4611","3","I was but a simple teenage boy, looking for a good action movie, and then there was a shining light on a TV station I had never really watched, a little station known as SBS."
"2913","tt0089374","4611","4","One night I noticed in the TV guide that a movie starring Jackie Chan 'Police Story' would be on later."
"2914","tt0089374","4611","5","Being fifteen, and having only seen 'Rumble in the Bronx' and 'Rush Hour', I said..."
"2915","tt0089374","4611","6","""WOW AWESOME"" and sat down to watch it, and continually shouted ""WOW AWESOME"" as the movie progressed."
"2916","tt0089374","4611","7","Two weeks later, after SBS had shown the 'Police Story' trilogy, I knew I had found my new favourite actor."
"2917","tt0089374","4611","8","Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong cop who busts a major drug lord, Chu Yuen Chor."
"2918","tt0089374","4611","9","Chu's secretary, Selina Fong Brigitte Lin, is being held by the police as a witness against Chu, and Chan is assigned to protect her."
"2919","tt0089374","4611","10","Things go bad reaaaal bad when Chu's case is dismissed and he decides he wants Fong and Chan dead.'"
"2920","tt0089374","4611","11","Police Story' is one of the greatest action movies ever, and certainly one of my favourite Jackie Chan films."
"2921","tt0089374","4611","12","It starts off strong, and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed."
"2922","tt0089374","4611","13","Everything in between is great."
"2923","tt0089374","4611","14","However, some of the funny parts may seem a little tasteless to more than a few people..."
"2924","tt0089374","4611","15","As a story, this is still one of Jackie's better efforts."
"2925","tt0089374","4611","16","For an action movie, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is a much better actor in this than he is in the acting & plot intensive 'New Police Story'."
"2926","tt0089374","4611","17","This isn't 'Miracles', but maybe that's a good thing.'"
"2927","tt0089374","4611","18","Police Story' is one of Jackie's finest works."
"2928","tt0089374","4611","19","It got me hooked on Jackie Chan movies, and should provide a nice start for any potential Jackie fans."
"2929","tt0089374","4611","20","The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan movies don't come much better 10/10"
"2930","tt0092067","4053","1","I remember liking this more than Nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me."
"2931","tt0092067","4053","2","Laputa, whose title seems to have affected its release in the U.S. to avoid confusion to its wide Hispanic audiences, has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production Conan."
"2932","tt0092067","4053","3","In fact, Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then started running."
"2933","tt0092067","4053","4","This makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch."
"2934","tt0092067","4053","5","The techie fans of Nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out Laputa the only exception may be the robot."
"2935","tt0092067","4053","6","Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, the theme in Laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism."
"2936","tt0092067","4053","7","If it has a theme at all it's anti warfare."
"2937","tt0092067","4053","8","The importance of living naturally this is related with the flying castle, is dismissably shortly discussed, and not really followed through."
"2938","tt0092067","4053","9","Overall, I now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel good and corny."
"2939","tt0092067","4054","1","The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad."
"2940","tt0092067","4054","2","My dad actually recorded it off the TV."
"2941","tt0092067","4054","3","I must have watched is over 20 times, before the relatively recent release on DVD.I of course bought and watched the DVD and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed."
"2942","tt0092067","4054","4","In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark."
"2943","tt0092067","4054","5","However the new version, featuring Van Der Beek et al, is more comic."
"2944","tt0092067","4054","6","To put it another way, it's like watching the original US release of Akira with that dub, before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the Japanese."
"2945","tt0092067","4054","7","I'm in no way complaining, the story and quality of animation are not detracted from, but it does raise the question of whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film....."
"2946","tt0092067","4055","1","This film is amazing and I would recommend to child and adult alike."
"2947","tt0092067","4055","2","The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; far better than anything the American studios were producing at the time."
"2948","tt0092067","4055","3","However, there is a couple of caveats to this statement."
"2949","tt0092067","4055","4","It's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli back catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it."
"2950","tt0092067","4055","5","My main point being, Disney re dubbed the film, despite the original English version being very impressive."
"2951","tt0092067","4055","6","The new cast with Van Der Beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e.g."
"2952","tt0092067","4055","7","Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers."
"2953","tt0092067","4055","8","The Original music score is also far better than the Disney remix."
"2954","tt0092067","4055","9","It begs the question why did Disney make such changes."
"2955","tt0092067","4055","10","It seems to me is that by having Van Der Beek et al being cast then Disney can draw in more money, which is fair enough, but in the process they tainted they film."
"2956","tt0092067","4055","11","It is still a beautiful film and I would still recommend it to anyone."
"2957","tt0092067","4055","12","My main beef is that Disney ruined a film from childhood which I loved and still love."
"2958","tt0092067","4055","13","I am lucky enough to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub which I am now going to guard with my life!"
"2959","tt0092067","4056","1","Saw this on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was titled ""Laputa: Castle in the sky""."
"2960","tt0092067","4056","2","I had enabled subtitles and I think SBS provided their own for that, which, as usual, was of very good quality."
"2961","tt0092067","4056","3","Just looked up ""Laputa"" on Wikipedia and it confirms what I suspected...the floating island of this tale is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel ""Gulliver's travels"", which was published in the early to mid 1700s."
"2962","tt0092067","4056","4","Anyway, this is an engaging Japanese fairytale, which features an English speaking voice cast."
"2963","tt0092067","4056","5","It's suitable for young children, I think, but it does run at just over two hours in length, so it may be too long for some, though not for an adult like me."
"2964","tt0092067","4056","6","The story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island which has a castle on it."
"2965","tt0092067","4056","7","The children are not the only ones looking for this island."
"2966","tt0092067","4056","8","They have pirates, the army and spies looking for the island too, and looking to capture the children Sheeta, the girl, voiced by Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy, voiced by James Van Der Beek in order to help them find it."
"2967","tt0092067","4056","9","The graphics are magnificent...sort of photo realistic at times, especially the scenes of stonework lit by torch light, or the pretty scenes of bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or mist."
"2968","tt0092067","4056","10","Recommended."
"2969","tt0092067","4057","1","Like many Americans, I was first introduced to the works of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw ""Spirited Away."""
"2970","tt0092067","4057","2","I fell in love with the film and have seen it many times."
"2971","tt0092067","4057","3","Now I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki."
"2972","tt0092067","4057","4","One of his earlier works is ""Castle in the Sky."""
"2973","tt0092067","4057","5","Although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as ""Spirited Away"" though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair."
"2974","tt0092067","4057","6","A young boy named Pazu James Van Der Beek is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky."
"2975","tt0092067","4057","7","When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Sheeta Anna Paquin."
"2976","tt0092067","4057","8","But Sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, Pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city."
"2977","tt0092067","4057","9","Going into a film by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic."
"2978","tt0092067","4057","10","Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki."
"2979","tt0092067","4057","11","Watching a film by Miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood."
"2980","tt0092067","4057","12","Because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words."
"2981","tt0092067","4057","13","It also helps that the translated dialogue is well written and voiced by talented actors."
"2982","tt0092067","4057","14","The voice acting is varied."
"2983","tt0092067","4057","15","James Van Der Beek fares best."
"2984","tt0092067","4057","16","He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character."
"2985","tt0092067","4057","17","Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta."
"2986","tt0092067","4057","18","She's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do."
"2987","tt0092067","4057","19","Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska."
"2988","tt0092067","4057","20","He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything to get it."
"2989","tt0092067","4057","21","The other voices are bad."
"2990","tt0092067","4057","22","Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola."
"2991","tt0092067","4057","23","Leachman may have won an Oscar for ""The Last Picture Show,"" but she's annoying as the pirate leader."
"2992","tt0092067","4057","24","Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous."
"2993","tt0092067","4057","25","It's so bad it nearly ruins the film!"
"2994","tt0092067","4057","26","Jim Cummings is an effective voice over actor, but he's miscast as the general."
"2995","tt0092067","4057","27","I would definitely recommend seeing ""Castle in the Sky."""
"2996","tt0092067","4057","28","I'll probably end up buying it myself."
"2997","tt0092067","4057","29","But even though it's not as good as ""Spirited Away,"" it's still pretty good."
"2998","tt0092067","4058","1","Retitled from its original Japanese name of LAPUTA for being an offensive phrase, something which director Hayao Miyazaki was oblivious to at the time, CASTLE IN THE SKY is the master animator's third film, and it's one of his most beloved of all time."
"2999","tt0092067","4058","2","Initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release, it has since been embraced by critics and audiences around the world."
"3000","tt0092067","4058","3","Inspired by Jonathan Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels"", CASTLE IN THE SKY is a steampunk themed action adventure tale about two young orphans young miner Pazu, and mysterious girl Sheeta who wears a magic crystal around her neck who team up to find the long lost island of Laputa, which is rumored to have great riches and gems."
"3001","tt0092067","4058","4","They are aided by a band of bumbling yet sympathetic air pirates led by the feisty Dola who at first chase them, yet turn out to be true allies and pursued by the government headed by its villainous topmost secret agent, Muska, who wants the power of Laputa for his own benefit."
"3002","tt0092067","4058","5","For anyone looking for an exciting way to spend two hours, this film is an excellent choice, featuring just the right amount of humor, exploration, wonder, and mystery to keep one interested."
"3003","tt0092067","4058","6","The artwork, although not as spectacular as in some of Miyazaki's later movies, is fantastic and gorgeous enough to watch with imaginative characters and locations, incredibly exciting action scenes, and breathtaking flight sequences that will make one feel giddy."
"3004","tt0092067","4058","7","And while the characters that populate this tale are less complex than Miyazaki's other works, each has a memorable, endearing personality that stays with the viewer long after the film is over."
"3005","tt0092067","4058","8","Dola, in particular, makes for a terrific comic character, shouting orders to her dimwitted sons one moment and being protective of Sheeta the next."
"3006","tt0092067","4058","9","Muska is one of the few Miyazaki creations to ever come across as an irredeemable villain, but like Dola, he commands every scene he's in with a sinister charisma that is both alluring and chilly."
"3007","tt0092067","4058","10","Anime fans have often compared this movie to Gainax's sci fi adventure series NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER."
"3008","tt0092067","4058","11","After all, both works share similar story and character elements... not to mention that they were both created by Miyazaki himself."
"3009","tt0092067","4058","12","Where both differ is in their execution."
"3010","tt0092067","4058","13","NADIA, although charming for the most part, suffered from taking a wrong turn at its midway point, devolving into cartoonish nonsense which all but distracted from the main plot, even though it did have a strong ending."
"3011","tt0092067","4058","14","CASTLE IN THE SKY, on the other hand, remains consistently entertaining and focused for its two hour running time, and is all the better for it."
"3012","tt0092067","4058","15","While the film's epic tone is sometimes broken up by some ""cartoonish"" moments, like a brawl between Pazu's boss and one of Dola's sons, it's never to the point that it detracts from the film."
"3013","tt0092067","4058","16","About eleven years ago, Disney released an English version featuring a cast of big names such as James van der Beek, Anna Paquin, Cloris Leachman, Mark Hamill, Mandy Patinkin as well as some cameo appearances by veterans such as Tress MacNeille and Jim Cummings."
"3014","tt0092067","4058","17","It also features an ambitious reworking of Joe Hisaishi's gorgeous musical score for a performance by the Seattle Music Orchestra interestingly, the man behind this rescore is none other than the composer himself."
"3015","tt0092067","4058","18","As much as purists have cried blasphemy over this version for its occasional extra dialogue and the aforementioned rescore, Miyazaki had no such problems; in fact, he is said to have applauded the reworking, and for good reason, because the newly rerecorded music is truly the star of the new dub."
"3016","tt0092067","4058","19","While there are some instances where filling in some critially silent scenes from the original Japanese is a bit jarring notably the journey through a dragon infested storm cloud, the overall reworking is fantastic and in many ways improves on the original, particularly in scenes such as when a robot attacks a fortress and the climactic moments toward the end."
"3017","tt0092067","4058","20","Here, Hisaishi displays his musical versatility and genius for matching music to visuals."
"3018","tt0092067","4058","21","As far as the performances in the dub go, the leads are probably at the short end of the stick; James Van Der Beek's Pazu sounds significantly more mature than his character, while Anna Paquin's Sheeta speaks with an odd accent that fluctuates at times a problem which actually works in favor of the character."
"3019","tt0092067","4058","22","That said, both do good jobs overall and provide a fairly believable chemistry throughout."
"3020","tt0092067","4058","23","It's the lively supporting cast, however, that really make this dub so much fun, particularly Cloris Leachman's Dola and Mark Hamill's Muska."
"3021","tt0092067","4058","24","Both are perfectly cast and steal every scene they're in; as with the rescore, these two really warrant a listen to the Disney dub."
"3022","tt0092067","4058","25","The script adaptation borders on the loose side at times there's quite a bit of extra lines and/or commentary some of which are pricelessly funny and others somewhat overdone but aside from at least one debatable alteration Sheeta's speech in the climactic showdown ""the world cannot live without love"" as opposed to the original ""you can't survive apart from Mother Earth"", the overall characters, story, and spirit remain fairly faithful to the original."
"3023","tt0092067","4058","26","On the whole, there is little point comparing the Disney version to the original language track; each puts their own stamp on this legendary masterpiece, and I like them both."
"3024","tt0092067","4058","27","They're also better than Streamline/JAL's more literal but frightfully robotic, lifeless, abysmally acted and poorly written older dub from the late 1980's; don't believe anybody who says this version is ""superior"" to Disneys trust me, the opposite is true."
"3025","tt0092067","4058","28","Either way, though, you can't go wrong with CASTLE IN THE SKY."
"3026","tt0092067","4058","29","It's one of Miyazaki's all time greatest, and I highly recommend it."
"3027","tt0092067","4059","1","The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic, this is more of an action comedy adventure with a fairly weak SF premise."
"3028","tt0092067","4059","2","For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it."
"3029","tt0092067","4059","3","Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection."
"3030","tt0092067","4059","4","The animation, though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa."
"3031","tt0092067","4059","5","I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque' anime style."
"3032","tt0092067","4059","6","Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates."
"3033","tt0092067","4059","7","They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure."
"3034","tt0092067","4059","8","There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it."
"3035","tt0092067","4059","9","Still. having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film even if she's basically a female Long John Silver."
"3036","tt0092067","4059","10","Don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'Treasure Planet' at times and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub."
"3037","tt0092067","4059","11","The English voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually."
"3038","tt0092067","4059","12","However something started going pear shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark."
"3039","tt0092067","4059","13","I think the best way that I could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story."
"3040","tt0092067","4059","14","I'll come back to that later."
"3041","tt0092067","4059","15","There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'."
"3042","tt0092067","4059","16","It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag."
"3043","tt0092067","4059","17","The crucial thing for me was this: I really found that I didn't care much about any of the characters."
"3044","tt0092067","4059","18","Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie."
"3045","tt0092067","4059","19","Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals."
"3046","tt0092067","4059","20","That's where Laputa falls down as far as I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie."
"3047","tt0092067","4059","21","Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'Great Mouse Detective'."
"3048","tt0092067","4059","22","Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but I do feel it's over rated."
"3049","tt0092067","4059","23","I definitely prefer the earlier 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'."
"3050","tt0092067","4059","24","BTW, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox squirrel from Nausicaa popping up briefly in Laputa."
"3051","tt0092067","4060","1","It is an almost ideal romantic anime!"
"3052","tt0092067","4060","2","MUST SEE FOR ALL AGES!"
"3053","tt0092067","4060","3","But the English dubbed version is not too good."
"3054","tt0092067","4060","4","Perhaps the 1999 version will be better."
"3055","tt0092067","4061","1","This is the best dub I've ever heard by Disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service."
"3056","tt0092067","4061","2","UrrrghhhThis one has different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine."
"3057","tt0092067","4061","3","This one has both hero and heroine although I don't really endorse the use of hero & heroine here, since Miyazaki is out from the stereotype & common theme."
"3058","tt0092067","4061","4","As usual, after being introduced by Spirited away, amazed by Mononoke, troubled by Grave of Fireflies, and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin , this one start with a bit doubt in my part."
"3059","tt0092067","4061","5","Wondering if this will be the first Ghibi's dud."
"3060","tt0092067","4061","6","Well, in the end just like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up giving 10 rating."
"3061","tt0092067","4061","7","I'd give 9.8 rating, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie."
"3062","tt0092067","4061","8","SPOILER Somehow I see this as a sad movie, people die in this one, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and it ends with destruction."
"3063","tt0092067","4061","9","It is as if mankind really can't live with too much power."
"3064","tt0092067","4061","10","The collapsing scene gave me patches of Metropolis ending."
"3065","tt0092067","4061","11","It's just sad somehow."
"3066","tt0092067","4061","12","The plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well as always."
"3067","tt0092067","4061","13","Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber."
"3068","tt0092067","4061","14","People who can brings a movie, a game, an event to life, even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition."
"3069","tt0092067","4061","15","This is a feel good movie that used to be part of US cinema in the classic days It's a Wonderful Life etc etc."
"3070","tt0092067","4061","16","Well, things change...."
"3071","tt0092067","4062","1","I just realised I've been using IMDb for years now and I've never reviewed my favourite film."
"3072","tt0092067","4062","2","By favourite I don't mean something I like for now, I mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it."
"3073","tt0092067","4062","3","This is obvious because I am never going to be a child again; I saw this film on ITV in the early nineties."
"3074","tt0092067","4062","4","I was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at, I'm also male, the gender that this film is intended for the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are female."
"3075","tt0092067","4062","5","Consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and I am forever indebted to Carl Macek sp. for producing the English dub of this film which is far superior to the Di$ney production which is not even funny I've never even been able to watch that one of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the Macek version is SO good the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original Japanese actors that this version is available on the Japanese DVD!"
"3076","tt0092067","4062","6","It's not available on any distribution in an English speaking country."
"3077","tt0092067","4062","7","Go figure."
"3078","tt0092067","4062","8","There are hundreds of competent reviews so I'm going to put some trivia here, not that I'm the definitive archive of information for this film."
"3079","tt0092067","4062","9","First up I'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's films they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on IMDb combined pale into insignificance."
"3080","tt0092067","4062","10","The fascinating story with this film is that Miyazaki based the countryside around Slag's Ravine Pazu's town area on the Welsh mining communities."
"3081","tt0092067","4062","11","He visited Wales for a few months in the early 80s might be late 70s just after one of the great mining strikes."
"3082","tt0092067","4062","12","Being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight."
"3083","tt0092067","4062","13","The fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man."
"3084","tt0092067","4062","14","The countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where I grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest British Isles."
"3085","tt0092067","4062","15","The island is of course from Swift's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century the story in Swift's book is, deliberately, ridiculous."
"3086","tt0092067","4062","16","In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki weaves together myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel I think the architecture in addition is based on Peruvian ruins though I'm not sure, someone told me that."
"3087","tt0092067","4062","17","Anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film REALLY will want to check out Miyazaki's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan Future Boy Conan based on the short sci fi novel 'The Incredible Tide' by Alexander key novel is available online."
"3088","tt0092067","4062","18","Conan is basically a prototype for Laputa's Pazu and Shita."
"3089","tt0092067","4062","19","In addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for Masterpiece Theatre some of his key frame animation."
"3090","tt0092067","4062","20","He also did key frame for Sherlock Hound this has some of the finest backgrounds I've ever seen too."
"3091","tt0092067","4062","21","Also check out Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film Horus Prince of the Sun 1968 amazing by today's standards in fact."
"3092","tt0092067","4062","22","What else..."
"3093","tt0092067","4062","23","Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship though they're pretty rare."
"3094","tt0092067","4062","24","This film is such a gift, I don't know what we'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around, this is like an oasis."
"3095","tt0092067","4062","25","Arigatou Miyazaki sensei!"
"3096","tt0092067","4063","1","Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film."
"3097","tt0092067","4063","2","After seeing it for the first time I'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint."
"3098","tt0092067","4063","3","On the contrary, you get your time's worth, which means as to what Miyazaki's films are concern, that is nothing less than excellent!"
"3099","tt0092067","4063","4","Produced early in his cinematic career, Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies, with strong but young female characters, forced to grow up due to external circumstances, helped out by very interesting and some times lovable supporting characters."
"3100","tt0092067","4063","5","And, of course, the usual battle of nature versus civilization, flying machines lots of it!!, beautiful painted sceneries but alas, no pigs at least that i've noticed, after all I have only seen it once."
"3101","tt0092067","4063","6","Never the less, Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier, with Nausicãa, which was a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus."
"3102","tt0092067","4063","7","Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two, with a soft action packed first 30 minutes, resembling his TV series Conan, and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes."
"3103","tt0092067","4063","8","In here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, only to be found by Pazu, a young boy working in a little countryside mining town."
"3104","tt0092067","4063","9","Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from, whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates."
"3105","tt0092067","4063","10","As the movie progresses, the plot gets heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at his best."
"3106","tt0092067","4063","11","The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away, or vice versa, as Castle in the sky was produced first, and much like its director, Joe Hisaishi _the composer_ starts with a very light score, that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward!"
"3107","tt0092067","4063","12","A note to the English dubbing, with a good interpretation from the two lead stars, although Anna Paquin's Sheeta has a very thick accent which the actress still had at that point in her career, and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska, making up for a delighting yet devilish villain!"
"3108","tt0092067","4063","13","Don't miss this one people!"
"3109","tt0092067","4064","1","I never met a single person out of hundreds who hated this movie."
"3110","tt0092067","4064","2","Bet that anyone who votes it down is a petty saboteur, or a victim of one."
"3111","tt0092067","4064","3","This film has everything."
"3112","tt0092067","4064","4","Ask yourself, ""Are you a fan of. . . ."""
"3113","tt0092067","4064","5","Then go see ""Laputa""."
"3114","tt0092067","4064","6","It's not my favorite movie, but my favorite IS directed by the same person Hayao Miyazaki."
"3115","tt0092067","4064","7","In any case, this one ranks among my top five."
"3116","tt0092067","4064","8","And I've seen a LOT of movies."
"3117","tt0092067","4065","1","I've seen the original English version on video."
"3118","tt0092067","4065","2","Disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising."
"3119","tt0092067","4065","3","I can't believe I'm saying that."
"3120","tt0092067","4065","4","The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own."
"3121","tt0092067","4065","5","The two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film."
"3122","tt0092067","4065","6","The animation quality is excellent!"
"3123","tt0092067","4065","7","If you've seen Disney's job of Kiki's delivery service you can see the quality in their production."
"3124","tt0092067","4065","8","It almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion. but not quite!"
"3125","tt0092067","4065","9","Finally Miyazaki's films are being released properly!"
"3126","tt0092067","4065","10","I can't wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa!"
"3127","tt0092067","4066","1","Lapyuta Castle in the Sky, more than any of Hayao Miyazaki's movies, brings the joy of storytelling to the audience."
"3128","tt0092067","4066","2","It is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again; it's just magical."
"3129","tt0092067","4066","3","It's a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states, but now that it's here check it out!"
"3130","tt0092067","4066","4","And stick with the original language; the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie or book, whatever."
"3131","tt0092067","4066","5","I give it a ten/ten."
"3132","tt0092067","4067","1","Hayao Miyazaki's second feature film, and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically though his debut Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best, 'Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta' AKA 'Castle in the Sky' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Mononoke hime' and 'Spirited Away', but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime."
"3133","tt0092067","4067","2","It's important to remember that 'Castle in the Sky' was made two years before the revolutionary 'Akira', and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece, the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters, and the story is quite predictable and obvious at least in today's standards, Miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before."
"3134","tt0092067","4067","3","While the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times, the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable if not as breathtaking as 'Spirited Away'."
"3135","tt0092067","4067","4","And if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces at this point Miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of Japanese cartooning you'll see Miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on 'Spirited Away' and Mononoke."
"3136","tt0092067","4067","5","While 'Castle in the Sky', being a sci fi adventure and very suitable for children, fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since, his motifs and principles still show and play an important part."
"3137","tt0092067","4067","6","To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up."
"3138","tt0092067","4067","7","Suffice to say that I'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn't go any higher for 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke'."
"3139","tt0092067","4067","8","And that would be a crime."
"3140","tt0092067","4067","9","As in most anime movies, I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese the English overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous."
"3141","tt0092067","4067","10","You might want to watch it in the English version once, though, just for the laughs, and for the star filled cast the English dub was only recorded following the success of 'Spirited Away', as it was for 'Kiki's Delivery Service' Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek Yeah, the Dawson guy!"
"3142","tt0092067","4067","11","fill the lead roles, Mark Hamill Luke Skywalker from 'Star Wars', in case you don't know!"
"3143","tt0092067","4067","12","plays the villain, and other roles are filled by Andy Dick, Tres MacNeille The Simpsons, Rugrats, Animaniacs..., Michael McShane Friar Tuck from Kevin Costner's Robin Hood travesty and Mandy Patinkin Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya..."
"3144","tt0092067","4067","13","Good for a laugh, or a few laughs really."
"3145","tt0092067","4067","14","But watch the Japanese one first."
"3146","tt0092067","4068","1","breathtaking, this is without doubt the best anime cartoon ever made. i first saw castle in the sky in the late 80s as a child and it left a lasting impression. years went by and i forgot the title of the film, and only by chance browsing on the internet i found this masterpiece again. after reading other peoples reviews and analysis I'm not surprised it has such acclaim and touched so many because it does leave an impression. a true fantasy adventure, a must see for all children and adults. its best not giving the story away so i would say watch this movie will a clear and open mind. if you have kids treat them to this i promise you they will love it. there's not much to say about this piece of art but if you've not seen it watch it and enjoy."
"3147","tt0092067","4069","1","Listening to the soundtrack at the moment, the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong in order to be able to type this."
"3148","tt0092067","4069","2","I've seen it twice thus far, and I should be ashamed for having seen it only twice."
"3149","tt0092067","4069","3","I've seen all Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli films, and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces except maybe for Nausicaa which was, even in the non cut up version too premature compared to the nec plus ultra manga."
"3150","tt0092067","4069","4","Still, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to get too naive/positive Chihiro, or, with more nuance, a bit too explicit/moralist Mononoke."
"3151","tt0092067","4069","5","At least, compared to for example the other Ghibli master Takahata Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars."
"3152","tt0092067","4069","6","But not this one."
"3153","tt0092067","4069","7","In Laputa, Miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages, combined with a bit of morale, but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with the humor and amusement of for example Totoro."
"3154","tt0092067","4069","8","Every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties."
"3155","tt0092067","4069","9","The pacing is so perfect that I know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being."
"3156","tt0092067","4069","10","The story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone, and the main theme kicks in, you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to uncover, but the story then settles and gradually, over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty, builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty like, following days of sombre gloom, finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning, knowing the path walked, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it."
"3157","tt0092067","4069","11","It is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb, you should see a therapist."
"3158","tt0092067","4069","12","Despite the fact that technically image wise some more recent Miyazakis might be more overwhelming, this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece."
"3159","tt0092067","4069","13","If you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986, you can only come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years."
"3160","tt0092067","4069","14","This of course has been suggested before, but to me this is his only film that can, on its own, fully illustrate that simple fact."
"3161","tt0092067","4069","15","If you miss this during your lifetime, you'll die with a huge gap which would be a pity, as the coffin costs the same."
"3162","tt0092067","4070","1","I know Anime."
"3163","tt0092067","4070","2","I've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon; i loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z even was."
"3164","tt0092067","4070","3","And just so you know I'm not bragging about my, let me say this: out of all the animes I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best."
"3165","tt0092067","4070","4","It's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree."
"3166","tt0092067","4070","5","Most people only know that movie because it one an Acedmy Award; this isn't an exaggeration I've shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who'd only ever seen Spirited Away, and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three."
"3167","tt0092067","4070","6","Personally, I'd never thought that anything could compare to Princess Mononoke, until I finally saw Castle in the Sky."
"3168","tt0092067","4070","7","I still think that the prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with it; in many ways, Castle has major elements that Mononoke was missing."
"3169","tt0092067","4070","8","In either case, if you've only seen Spirited Away, and think that that is Miyazaki's best film, be prepared to have your earth shaken."
"3170","tt0092067","4071","1","I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called. now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a little hazy I was in no way disappointed by what I saw. the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone."
"3171","tt0092067","4071","2","But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike. with a floating island, a mad general, a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down I would recommend this film to any one."
"3172","tt0092067","4072","1","Hayao Miyazaki name became prominent with Spitied Away, however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts."
"3173","tt0092067","4072","2","Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138."
"3174","tt0092067","4072","3","I remember seeing fragments of this movie almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation."
"3175","tt0092067","4072","4","So when I found a copy in a well known store for £9 I couldn't resist but buy it."
"3176","tt0092067","4072","5","The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it memory is funny that way."
"3177","tt0092067","4072","6","Viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud some of the artwork is."
"3178","tt0092067","4072","7","I can only assume some influence here."
"3179","tt0092067","4072","8","When Pazu catches a falling girl Sheeta his adventure really begins the quest for Laputa a reference to Jonathan Swift's overlooked portion of Gulliver's Travels."
"3180","tt0092067","4072","9","With healthy references to Jules Verne it's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on Laputa."
"3181","tt0092067","4072","10","This is the portion that is strongest in my memory the 'pastoral' ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree."
"3182","tt0092067","4072","11","This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie the views of the surface of Laputa, as opposed to the mechanised underground."
"3183","tt0092067","4072","12","Although this is the dichotomy of this movie to show that even technology cannot overcome nature the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals."
"3184","tt0092067","4072","13","The ending of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same."
"3185","tt0092067","4072","14","It is incredibly stylish, I would not say 'slick' very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, airships and the design and look of just about everything."
"3186","tt0092067","4072","15","Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japnanese anime."
"3187","tt0092067","4072","16","Buy this movie and treasure it."
"3188","tt0092067","4073","1","Have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own, with one of your closest friends at your side, facing all sorts of dangers and villains, and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets."
"3189","tt0092067","4073","2","Even if you're not quite that much of a fantasy lover, have you ever wished you could simply experience what it's like to be a kid again, and not have a care in the world, for just a couple of hours."
"3190","tt0092067","4073","3","This is exactly what Miyazaki's ""Castle in the Sky"" is all about."
"3191","tt0092067","4073","4","Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day, a girl named Sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds, while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail."
"3192","tt0092067","4073","5","Simply put, it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another, and I can't help but feel my worries melt away every time I see it."
"3193","tt0092067","4073","6","As it is one of Miyazaki's older works and takes much place in the everyday world, the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, or even Princess Mononoke."
"3194","tt0092067","4073","7","Still, I find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other, because all three of those films are, at some point or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not perplexing, especially for the youngest of viewers."""
"3195","tt0092067","4073","8","Castle in the Sky"", on the other hand, doesn't try so much to be an allegory of any kind, and it's not a coming of age story either; it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child's mind I've ever seen."
"3196","tt0092067","4073","9","Not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of perspective from the kids' eyes is just amazing; whether it's the panning up of the ""camera"" to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead, or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I just can't help but FEEL like I'm there with Pazu and Sheeta, just a kid in another world, far far away from reality."
"3197","tt0092067","4073","10","Even the kids themselves don't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like Ashitaka/San or Chihiro/Haku; Sheeta is Pazu's angel, having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day, the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start."
"3198","tt0092067","4073","11","As the film progresses, more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions."
"3199","tt0092067","4073","12","Not only are they an adorable reminder of who I used to be, but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film, only growing stronger all the way to the last frame."
"3200","tt0092067","4073","13","For that reason, I've fallen in love with the two of them more than I have with any other Miyazaki couple."
"3201","tt0092067","4073","14","At the same time, ""Castle in the Sky"" is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be, you'll be sure to find your fix here."
"3202","tt0092067","4073","15","Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, sci fi, romance, even some western...it's all here, just about everything people go to the movies for except maybe horror."
"3203","tt0092067","4073","16","This why I can easily recommend it as a first Miyazaki film; it's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works."
"3204","tt0092067","4073","17","Even the ending song of the film, when translated into English, conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization, and some kind of soul mate, that could not be found in our mundane lives."
"3205","tt0092067","4073","18","""The reason I long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them..."
"3206","tt0092067","4073","19","The earth spins, carrying you, carrying us both who'll surely meet."""
"3207","tt0092067","4073","20","Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of Joe Hiasashi's gorgeous scores, but this is the only one I've seen that's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream."
"3208","tt0092067","4073","21","I have found myself near tears just listening to it."""
"3209","tt0092067","4073","22","Castle in the Sky"" may not be Miyazaki's most developed, spectacular, or meaningful work, but it's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be: a true vision of childhood fantasy, and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids."
"3210","tt0092067","4073","23","Sit back, relax, and love it for what it is."
"3211","tt0092067","4074","1","It's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being 'the best,' whether of all time, a certain genre, or what have you, but I believe a strong argument could be made that in fact, Laputa is the greatest animated film ever made."
"3212","tt0092067","4074","2","It is in my mind the masterwork of Hayao Miyazaki, the most talented of Japan's animated directors, and it best captures his strengths as a director, storyteller, and designer, as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes."
"3213","tt0092067","4074","3","The version I'm reviewing is the 2003 American dub I know, sacrilege for a hard core anime fan to not watch it in its native language; there is at least one other English language dub out there, I have it on VHS I have no idea from what source, and that version is the single best dub I have ever encountered of any film."
"3214","tt0092067","4074","4","But I thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find."
"3215","tt0092067","4074","5","Laputa tells the story of a boy named Pazu voiced by James Van Der Beek here, who's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named Sheeta Anna Paquin literally drops from the sky."
"3216","tt0092067","4074","6","It seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent, Colonel Muska Mark Hamill, who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck."
"3217","tt0092067","4074","7","To keep things lively, there's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal, led by the aging but still boisterous Dola Cloris Leachman."
"3218","tt0092067","4074","8","The plot revolves around the crystal's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of Laputa, a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure."
"3219","tt0092067","4074","9","It's all very much in keeping with a fairy tale setting, but Miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story, and the plot is peppered with 'gosh wow' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature."
"3220","tt0092067","4074","10","The design work on Laputa, nearly twenty years later, is still revolutionary."
"3221","tt0092067","4074","11","Flying machines of all sorts abound, utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking."
"3222","tt0092067","4074","12","The world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century, with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines."
"3223","tt0092067","4074","13","But it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution; Laputa is both the Garden of Eden and the Fire of Heaven itself, and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal, its power, and its danger."
"3224","tt0092067","4074","14","Besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film, Laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography."
"3225","tt0092067","4074","15","From sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water, Laputa displays a scope that most films  even with the magic of CGI  can only daydream about."
"3226","tt0092067","4074","16","Though we only see a small fraction of this world, its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it."
"3227","tt0092067","4074","17","The film also contains one of my favorite, if not the most exciting, action sequences ever: a guardian robot that fell to Earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in, all the while trying to protect Sheeta who was the one who woke it up."
"3228","tt0092067","4074","18","Meanwhile, Pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her, literally, from the jaws of destruction."
"3229","tt0092067","4074","19","From the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last second rescue, the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience."
"3230","tt0092067","4074","20","It helps that Laputa has an amazing score."
"3231","tt0092067","4074","21","Composer Joe Hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world, the dewy innocence, the exciting action, and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians."
"3232","tt0092067","4074","22","Though he re recorded it for this DVD release which IMO is not an improvement over his original score, adding pieces here and there, the score matches the visuals perfectly, a rare total union of sound and vision."
"3233","tt0092067","4074","23","This isn't a bad dub."
"3234","tt0092067","4074","24","I'm inordinately fond of the older English dub, and this one over explains things just a tad in spots, but I was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those and those matched the Japanese pretty well."
"3235","tt0092067","4074","25","Dola in particular is hard to get right, but Leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman her sons aren't quite as good as the original."
"3236","tt0092067","4074","26","Paquin does a good job as Sheeta, and Mark Hamill, while I knew it was him early, is more than talented enough to do Muska I liked the other English dub of Muska a little more, but Hamill's good."
"3237","tt0092067","4074","27","Much of the film rests on Pazu's shoulders, and Van Der Beek is wonderful."
"3238","tt0092067","4074","28","Listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other English dub, because VDB matches up very closely with the original Pazu."
"3239","tt0092067","4074","29","Although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful, as much as I love this film, I don't think you're sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular Anglicized version."
"3240","tt0092067","4074","30","John Lassiter of Pixar introduces it up front, and my suspicion is that he, like so many others, simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality."
"3241","tt0092067","4074","31","Miyazaki has had success in America in recent years with Spirited Away and Mononoke one of his few films I didn't care for, but to me Laputa is still his crowning achievement."
"3242","tt0092067","4074","32","Anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work, and again, this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder."
"3243","tt0092067","4074","33","I'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen; while that will probably never happen, it's good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on DVD."
"3244","tt0092067","4075","1","Laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb."
"3245","tt0092067","4075","2","The message is as strong as his newer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better!"
"3246","tt0092067","4075","3","The art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after this, im not sure if this was the first time i heard it and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack."
"3247","tt0092067","4075","4","Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy, Pazu is also a great role model he lives on his own!"
"3248","tt0092067","4075","5","The plot is classic Miyazaki."
"3249","tt0092067","4075","6","I won't give it away, but the end is really great."
"3250","tt0092067","4075","7","I rank this as one of Miyazaki's three best with Nausicaa and Spirited Away."
"3251","tt0092067","4075","8","Also you may want to check out Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out sometime next year i hope If you like Miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the USA."
"3252","tt0092067","4075","9","Enjoy, Piper A"
"3253","tt0092067","4076","1","By now you've probably heard a bit about the new Disney dub of Miyazaki's classic film, Laputa: Castle In The Sky."
"3254","tt0092067","4076","2","During late summer of 1998, Disney released ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" on video which included a preview of the Laputa dub saying it was due out in ""1999""."
"3255","tt0092067","4076","3","It's obviously way past that year now, but the dub has been finally completed."
"3256","tt0092067","4076","4","And it's not ""Laputa: Castle In The Sky"", just ""Castle In The Sky"" for the dub, since Laputa is not such a nice word in Spanish even though they use the word Laputa many times throughout the dub."
"3257","tt0092067","4076","5","You've also probably heard that world renowned composer, Joe Hisaishi, who scored the movie originally, went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements."
"3258","tt0092067","4076","6","Laputa came out before My Neighbor Totoro and after Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which began Studio Ghibli and it's long string of hits."
"3259","tt0092067","4076","7","And in my opinion, I think it's one of Miyazaki's best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem."
"3260","tt0092067","4076","8","Laputa: Castle in the Sky is a film for all ages and I urge everyone to see it."
"3261","tt0092067","4076","9","For those unfamiliar with Castle in the Sky's story, it begins right at the start and doesn't stop for the next two hours."
"3262","tt0092067","4076","10","The storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted, you see Miyazaki's true vision."
"3263","tt0092067","4076","11","And believe me, it's one fantastic one."
"3264","tt0092067","4076","12","The film begins with Sheeta, a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship."
"3265","tt0092067","4076","13","Sheeta holds the key to Laputa, the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization."
"3266","tt0092067","4076","14","The key to Laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many, namely the government, the military and the air pirate group, the Dola gang who Sheeta and Pazu later befriend."
"3267","tt0092067","4076","15","Soon, the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid."
"3268","tt0092067","4076","16","She falls a few thousand feet, but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant."
"3269","tt0092067","4076","17","As she floats down from the sky, Pazu, an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines, sees Sheeta and catches her."
"3270","tt0092067","4076","18","The two become fast friends, but thanks to her pendant, the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the Dola gang and government try to capture Sheeta."
"3271","tt0092067","4076","19","One action sequence after another, we learn all of the character's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue."
"3272","tt0092067","4076","20","Plus somewhat twisty surprise."
"3273","tt0092067","4076","21","I think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time."
"3274","tt0092067","4076","22","The story is wonderful, as we peak into Hayao Miyazaki's animation which has no limits."
"3275","tt0092067","4076","23","The setting of the film is a combo of many time periods."
"3276","tt0092067","4076","24","It does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s, but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons."
"3277","tt0092067","4076","25","Laputa is also surprisingly a funny film."
"3278","tt0092067","4076","26","The film has tons of hilarious moments, almost equal to the drama and action the film holds."
"3279","tt0092067","4076","27","I think the funniest part is a fight scene where Pazu's boss faces off against a pirate, and soon after a riot breaks out."
"3280","tt0092067","4076","28","It's funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly."
"3281","tt0092067","4076","29","Now let's talk about how the dub rates."
"3282","tt0092067","4076","30","An excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life."
"3283","tt0092067","4076","31","Teen heartthrob James Van Der Beek plays the hero Pazu, who has a much more mature voice then in the Japanese version, where in the original he sounded more childlike."
"3284","tt0092067","4076","32","Either way, I think his voice is a nice fit with Pazu."
"3285","tt0092067","4076","33","Anna Paquin, the young Oscar winner from ""The Piano"", plays Sheeta."
"3286","tt0092067","4076","34","This is also a nice performance, but the voice is a bit uneven, she doesn't stay true to one accent."
"3287","tt0092067","4076","35","At times she sounds as American as apple pie, but at other times she sounds like someone from New Zealand."
"3288","tt0092067","4076","36","The performance I most enjoyed however was of Coris Leachman, who played Mama Dola."
"3289","tt0092067","4076","37","Not only is this an excellent performance, but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life."
"3290","tt0092067","4076","38","If there was ever a live action Laputa movie G d forbid, she would be the one to play her, you can just imagine her in the role well, somewhat."
"3291","tt0092067","4076","39","Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill is Muska, and this is another top rate Hamill performance."
"3292","tt0092067","4076","40","You may be familiar with Hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original Star Wars movies, but he renders Muska to full evil."
"3293","tt0092067","4076","41","His voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the Joker, who he played for many episodes on the animated Batman series."
"3294","tt0092067","4076","42","Rounding out the cast is voice character actor Jim Cummings, who does a great, gruff job as the general and Andy Dick and Mandy Patakin as members of the Dola gang."
"3295","tt0092067","4076","43","Now let me talk about what really makes this dub special, Joe Hisaishi's newly arranged music!"
"3296","tt0092067","4076","44","For those who have never heard of him, Mr."
"3297","tt0092067","4076","45","Hisaishi does the music and like all of Miyazaki's films, the music is very memorable."
"3298","tt0092067","4076","46","Each of his scores has it's own personas which fits the particular film perfectly."
"3299","tt0092067","4076","47","Now, these new arrangements he has done are more ""American like"", which I think was the goal of the new recordings."
"3300","tt0092067","4076","48","Don't worry, the classic tunes of the Japanese version are still here in great form."
"3301","tt0092067","4076","49","The score, to me, sounds to be arranged like this is a Hollywood blockbuster."
"3302","tt0092067","4076","50","It has more power, it has more emphasis, it's clearer and deeper."
"3303","tt0092067","4076","51","The film's prologue, the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships, has some new music I am not sure, but I believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all."
"3304","tt0092067","4076","52","But a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy."
"3305","tt0092067","4076","53","Things seem very enhanced."
"3306","tt0092067","4076","54","In a powerful scene, the music is more stronger then in the original versions."
"3307","tt0092067","4076","55","In a calm scene, it's more calmer."
"3308","tt0092067","4076","56","Overall, I think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes, I highly did myself, and personally think it helps improve the film."
"3309","tt0092067","4076","57","I prefer the new score over the old one, and I hope Disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack."
"3310","tt0092067","4076","58","Another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful, and much of the original Japanese lines are intact."
"3311","tt0092067","4076","59","In Kiki, I'm sure a few lines where changed, and this is the same way, lines have been changed."
"3312","tt0092067","4076","60","But a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue Miyazaki has written."
"3313","tt0092067","4076","61","I was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered, but they were there intact."
"3314","tt0092067","4076","62","Some new lines have been added as well which help out."
"3315","tt0092067","4076","63","But I am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing, Disney DID NOT translate the ending song, it was in Japanese."
"3316","tt0092067","4076","64","I was mortified when they did completely new songs for the Kiki dub, but with this version it's the original song... in Japanese."
"3317","tt0092067","4076","65","So I guess it's good it's still the original, but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak English."
"3318","tt0092067","4076","66","There is a big down side to this dub, and it deals with how the voices match the character's lips."
"3319","tt0092067","4076","67","Of course in any dub it won't be perfect, but I think in Kiki and Mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed and Disney had a little bit more time with this one...."
"3320","tt0092067","4076","68","Some of the time everything matches perfect, some of the time it doesn't completley match, and in a rare case, someone says something and the lips don't move at all there's a scene where Sheeta chuckles and her mouth doesn't move one bit."
"3321","tt0092067","4076","69","As far as things about the film itself, these are my thoughts."
"3322","tt0092067","4076","70","I thought the most amazing part of Laputa was the animation."
"3323","tt0092067","4076","71","From the opening sequence to the ending, the animation is so lush and detailed, you just have to watch in awe."
"3324","tt0092067","4076","72","You see the true nature of each character, true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action."
"3325","tt0092067","4076","73","You have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film."
"3326","tt0092067","4076","74","Everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn, it's like a moving piece of art."
"3327","tt0092067","4076","75","And to think, this was done in the mid 1980's."
"3328","tt0092067","4076","76","The animation is quite different from Disney, Ghibli has it's own distinctive flare which is very different, but very good."
"3329","tt0092067","4076","77","And after all these years, the colors look as vibrant as ever."
"3330","tt0092067","4076","78","Laputa also has tons of action sequences, lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground."
"3331","tt0092067","4076","79","These sequences are so well done and so intriguing, it's scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film."
"3332","tt0092067","4076","80","And the finale is just something you MUST see."
"3333","tt0092067","4076","81","The sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions, guns firing and everything else well."
"3334","tt0092067","4076","82","And like all Miyazaki films, each one focuses on a different theme i.g."
"3335","tt0092067","4076","83","Kiki: Confidence."
"3336","tt0092067","4076","84","This one has a great a lesson on greed and power."
"3337","tt0092067","4076","85","People don't realize how greed can take over you, and how having too much power isn't good."
"3338","tt0092067","4076","86","People are obsessed with power, and are greedy, and the main villian, Muska, greatly shows this."
"3339","tt0092067","4076","87","All in all, Laputa: Castle In The Sky was a great film to begin with, and is now improved for the most part."
"3340","tt0092067","4076","88","I am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it's glory."
"3341","tt0092067","4076","89","With a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from Joe Hisaishi, Disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy."
"3342","tt0092067","4076","90","Though I think the voices matched the mouths better in the Kiki and Princess Mononoke Disney dubs, Castle In The Sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film."
"3343","tt0092067","4077","1","I first saw this back in the early 90s on UK TV, i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it, many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it TV again, the main thing that stuck with me was the end, the hole castle part really touched me, its easy to watch, has a great story, great music, the list goes on and on, its OK me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it, yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch, it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty, i am so glad it has came out on DVD as it is one of my top 10 films of all time."
"3344","tt0092067","4077","2","Buy it or rent it just see it, best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you don't have to stop the film."
"3345","tt0092067","4077","3","Enjoy"
"3346","tt0092067","4078","1","This is one of my all time favorite movies, PERIOD."
"3347","tt0092067","4078","2","I can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does."
"3348","tt0092067","4078","3","This flick has it all: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs."
"3349","tt0092067","4078","4","Bad and even some Romance without even an innocent ""peck"" on the cheek between the Pazu and Sheeta."
"3350","tt0092067","4078","5","Maybe best of all, you don't have to be in Mensa to ""get it"" and enjoy the movie like you do with some of Miyazaki's other movies I don't know about you, but I watch movies to take a break from thinking."
"3351","tt0092067","4078","6","This is just a flat out enjoyable movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and go buy it."
"3352","tt0092067","4078","7","The only sour note is the American Dubbing."
"3353","tt0092067","4078","8","I found Vander Geek to be just plain annoying."
"3354","tt0092067","4078","9","But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the two disc set and it rocks!"
"3355","tt0092067","4078","10","Who cares if you can't understand spoken Japanese."
"3356","tt0092067","4078","11","If you can read at a second grade level then watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles."
"3357","tt0092067","4078","12","You won't regret it."
"3358","tt0092067","4079","1","I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK where it was called ""Laupta: The Flying Island""."
"3359","tt0092067","4079","2","I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it."
"3360","tt0092067","4079","3","I was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music."
"3361","tt0092067","4079","4","It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw sometimes erroneously referred to as the ""Streamline Dub"" the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box set."
"3362","tt0092067","4079","5","Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney."
"3363","tt0092067","4079","6","The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the ""streamline"" dub or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead."
"3364","tt0092067","4079","7","They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from ""Pazu"" to ""Patzu"", and added some dialogue."
"3365","tt0092067","4079","8","But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films."
"3366","tt0092067","4079","9","This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."
"3367","tt0092067","4079","10","The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass market, homogenized animation."
"3368","tt0092067","4080","1","This is one of the best animated family films of all time."
"3369","tt0092067","4080","2","Moreover, virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli."
"3370","tt0092067","4080","3","Specifically, other great films include ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Kikki's Delivery Service."""
"3371","tt0092067","4080","4","Spirited Away is quite good, but a bit too creepy for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult."
"3372","tt0092067","4080","5","The one thing that sets ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" apart from other films by Miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension filled adventure ride."
"3373","tt0092067","4080","6","Why is this film so good."
"3374","tt0092067","4080","7","Because it's a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the story is truly engaging and compelling."
"3375","tt0092067","4080","8","Most Japanese anime is imaginative, but decidedly dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized, and juvenile."
"3376","tt0092067","4080","9","None of these problems plague Castle in the Sky."
"3377","tt0092067","4080","10","It has imagination to burn, and the characters are well drawn, if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people."
"3378","tt0092067","4080","11","None of those trench coat wearing posers There is plenty of adventure, but not blood and gore."
"3379","tt0092067","4080","12","The animation is smooth, detailed, and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots."
"3380","tt0092067","4080","13","The backgrounds are wonderful."
"3381","tt0092067","4080","14","The voice acting in the dubbed English version is first rate, particularly the two leads, Pazo James Van der Beek and Sheeta Anna Paquin."
"3382","tt0092067","4080","15","The sound engineering is great, too."
"3383","tt0092067","4080","16","Use your studio sound, if you've got it."
"3384","tt0092067","4080","17","One aspect that I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained."
"3385","tt0092067","4080","18","Laputa was once inhabited, and is now abandoned."
"3386","tt0092067","4080","19","Why."
"3387","tt0092067","4080","20","We never know."
"3388","tt0092067","4080","21","We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized."
"3389","tt0092067","4080","22","Indeed, it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters, who are for the most part one dimensional stock characters e.g., gruff general, silly sidekick, kooky old miner, etc."
"3390","tt0092067","4080","23","Highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60!"
"3391","tt0092067","4081","1","I have seen just about all of Miyazaki's films, and they are all beautiful and captivating."
"3392","tt0092067","4081","2","But this one rises above the rest."
"3393","tt0092067","4081","3","This movie totally impressed me!"
"3394","tt0092067","4081","4","I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and their sweet, caring friendship."
"3395","tt0092067","4081","5","They were what made the movie for me."
"3396","tt0092067","4081","6","Of course, the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly."
"3397","tt0092067","4081","7","But the characters are the shining point in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality."
"3398","tt0092067","4081","8","Now, let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie with English subs."
"3399","tt0092067","4081","9","While the English dub is good mostly, it simply pales in comparison to the original language version."
"3400","tt0092067","4081","10","The voices are better, the dialogue, everything."
"3401","tt0092067","4081","11","So I suggest seeing and hearing the movie the way it originally was."
"3402","tt0092067","4082","1","Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney."
"3403","tt0092067","4082","2","That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist."
"3404","tt0092067","4082","3","He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride."
"3405","tt0092067","4082","4","But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking!"
"3406","tt0092067","4082","5","Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me."
"3407","tt0092067","4082","6","Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination."
"3408","tt0092067","4082","7","Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like."
"3409","tt0092067","4082","8","The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true."
"3410","tt0092067","4082","9","Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself."
"3411","tt0092067","4082","10","Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!"
"3412","tt0092067","4082","11","Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here."
"3413","tt0101811","427","1","one of the best ensemble acted films I've ever seen."
"3414","tt0101811","427","2","There isn't much to the plot, but the acting incredible."
"3415","tt0101811","427","3","You see the characters change ever so subtly, undr the influence of the rented villa in Italy, and love."
"3416","tt0101811","427","4","And happiness."
"3417","tt0101811","427","5","The film casts a mesmerizing spell on you, much as the villa does on all the women."
"3418","tt0101811","427","6","Truly ""enchanted""."
"3419","tt0101811","428","1","Two women, sick of their controlling husbands, taking a vacation in Italy for a month with two other very different women."
"3420","tt0101811","428","2","They come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film by Merchant Ivory."
"3421","tt0101811","428","3","Great scenery and the location isn't bad either."
"3422","tt0101811","428","4","Seriously, a very good period piece 7 of 10"
"3423","tt0101811","429","1","It has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism."
"3424","tt0101811","429","2","The only two movies I can think of is ""Enchanted April"" 1992 and ""The Enchanted Cottage"" 1945."
"3425","tt0101811","429","3","Both movies used wonderful actors not stars."
"3426","tt0101811","429","4","In both movies, all the actors gave their best romantic performances."""
"3427","tt0101811","429","5","Enchanted April"" is about four English women after WWI who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy while on vacation."
"3428","tt0101811","429","6","It is amazing ""Enchanted April"" was made in 1992."
"3429","tt0101811","429","7","It stands out as an enjoyable classic."
"3430","tt0101811","430","1","This was a very good film."
"3431","tt0101811","430","2","I didn't go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting, the script, and the scenery."
"3432","tt0101811","430","3","Miranda Richardson was fantastic and so was Joan Plowright."
"3433","tt0101811","430","4","They stole the show."
"3434","tt0101811","430","5","But the other actors played their parts wonderfully also."
"3435","tt0101811","430","6","Very enjoyable film."
"3436","tt0101811","431","1","It starts slowly, showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but don't give up on it."
"3437","tt0101811","431","2","Nothing much happens, but the time passes exquisitely, and there are numerous sly jokes my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm, which I find hilarious."
"3438","tt0101811","431","3","The movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word, the scenery is beautiful as is Polly Walker, and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying."
"3439","tt0101811","431","4","The movie takes a couple of liberties with the book, the biggest being with the Arbuthnot/Briggs/Dester business, but I actually preferred the movie's version of this it may be more sentimental, but I felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and anyway I like sentiment when it's well done."
"3440","tt0101811","431","5","An excellent movie, especially as a date movie during lousy weather."
"3441","tt0101811","432","1","I only watched this because it starred Josie Lawrence, who I knewfrom Whose Line is it Anyway., the wacky British improvisationalcomedy show."
"3442","tt0101811","432","2","I was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem."
"3443","tt0101811","432","3","It is uplifting, touching, andromantic without being sappy or sentimental."
"3444","tt0101811","432","4","The characters areall real people, with real foibles, fears and needs."
"3445","tt0101811","432","5","See it.!"
"3446","tt0101811","433","1","This is one of those rare movies, it's lovely and compelling, dignified and quirky, a true gift."
"3447","tt0101811","433","2","I consider it a prerequisite for any trip to Italy, or any vacation at all, because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience yup, find the magic."
"3448","tt0101811","433","3","I especially loved Josie Lawrence, as Lottie Wilkins, but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film."
"3449","tt0101811","433","4","Further the costumes, if you're drawn to fashion and costumes, are extraordinarily well done."
"3450","tt0101811","433","5","I just wish they'd release it on DVD because I'm wearing my tape version out!"
"3451","tt0101811","433","6","Absolutely well worth your time, just make sure to settle in to watch it, without any interruptions."
"3452","tt0101811","434","1","Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu."
"3453","tt0101811","434","2","Being a male, I'm probably not qualified to totally understand it, but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start."
"3454","tt0101811","434","3","It isn't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher."
"3455","tt0101811","434","4","What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters."
"3456","tt0101811","434","5","Each has their own ""thing"" that they contend with."
"3457","tt0101811","434","6","Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion."
"3458","tt0101811","434","7","What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have."
"3459","tt0101811","434","8","It didn't try to pound a lesson into us."
"3460","tt0101811","434","9","The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light."
"3461","tt0101811","434","10","I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen."
"3462","tt0101811","434","11","Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people."
"3463","tt0101811","435","1","Two thirds of nearly 2,000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8, 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes Was this a record, or merely a faulty VCR.."
"3464","tt0101811","435","2","Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination."
"3465","tt0101811","435","3","But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it."
"3466","tt0101811","435","4","My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book."
"3467","tt0101811","435","5","My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form."
"3468","tt0101811","435","6","Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things, but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing, although in no way syrupy, and was also very well written."
"3469","tt0101811","435","7","I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film, and so decided to buy her the videotape."
"3470","tt0101811","435","8","I am now very glad that I did, and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre Mussolini Italian atmosphere."
"3471","tt0101811","435","9","The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together, away from their families, in a rented villa in Italy."
"3472","tt0101811","435","10","Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds."
"3473","tt0101811","435","11","Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses, not only between these four very disparate mature ladies, but also with the occasional male visitor."
"3474","tt0101811","435","12","If you want action, thrills, dramatic sex scenes, natural or man made disasters, or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you."
"3475","tt0101811","435","13","But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch, and if you care to give it a try you may, as I did, come to rank it among your much loved films."
"3476","tt0101811","435","14","It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar."
"3477","tt0101811","435","15","In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film, but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book, effectively unrolled before my eyes."
"3478","tt0101811","435","16","Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this, the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio's Decameron on TV."
"3479","tt0101811","435","17","Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal, but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events."
"3480","tt0101811","435","18","This works very well, although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story."
"3481","tt0101811","435","19","Great credit is due to the Director, Mike Newell, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies."
"3482","tt0101811","436","1","I absolutely loved this movie."
"3483","tt0101811","436","2","I am not even sure what particularly about it but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVD."
"3484","tt0101811","436","3","The women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the Villa in Italy."
"3485","tt0101811","436","4","The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job."
"3486","tt0101811","436","5","The characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work."
"3487","tt0101811","436","6","There is humor, drama and relationship issues all in good time."
"3488","tt0101811","436","7","This requires 10 lines but I just can't think of any more to say so I will just rattle on until I get 10 lines."
"3489","tt0101811","436","8","So sorry about this."
"3490","tt0101811","436","9","What else can I possibly say it has been a long time since I last saw it."
"3491","tt0101811","436","10","I am looking forward to view again but it isn't available."
"3492","tt0101811","437","1","Enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words."
"3493","tt0101811","437","2","It has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out."
"3494","tt0101811","437","3","I continue to wait, albeit less patiently, for the film to come out in DVD format."
"3495","tt0101811","437","4","Apparently, I am not alone."
"3496","tt0101811","437","5","If parent company Amazon's listings are correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format."
"3497","tt0101811","437","6","Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script."
"3498","tt0101811","437","7","Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries."
"3499","tt0101811","437","8","The cast is spectacular, the cinematography and direction impeccable."
"3500","tt0101811","437","9","The film is a definite keeper."
"3501","tt0101811","437","10","Many have already asked."

"3503","tt0101811","438","1","From rainy, dreary late winter England of early 1920s... where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams known now as World War I..."
"3504","tt0101811","438","2","Four women share this lovely small sunny Italian castle on a hill; one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying, two women who will rediscover their own husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends......"

"3507","tt0101811","438","5","Study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story."
"3508","tt0101811","438","6","Probably not a film to please many men..."
"3509","tt0101811","438","7","NOTE: Stock up on coffee & hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day..."
"3510","tt0101811","438","8","Spring is coming..."
"3511","tt0101811","438","9","Enchanted April promises you!"
"3512","tt0101811","439","1","The true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way note that this change need not be positive or beneficial at the end."
"3513","tt0101811","439","2","By that measure, Enchanted April is a resounding success."
"3514","tt0101811","439","3","As a film in general, it succeeds quite well excellent ensemble cast, well developed characters you come to care about, wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations."
"3515","tt0101811","439","4","In short the film is, well, enchanting."
"3516","tt0101811","439","5","Although all the performances are first rate, three must be mentioned Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright."
"3517","tt0101811","439","6","It says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast."
"3518","tt0101811","439","7","Most highly recommended, particularly if you are a romantic at heart."
"3519","tt0101811","439","8","Further Deponent Saith Not."
"3520","tt0101811","440","1","My all time favorite movie."
"3521","tt0101811","440","2","Oscar caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera."
"3522","tt0101811","440","3","The screenplay is perfect, and works out the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfying way, unlike the novel."
"3523","tt0101811","440","4","The care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won Oscars for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment."
"3524","tt0101811","440","5","It is Josie Lawrence's best work by far, and transformed my opinion of Joan Plowright."
"3525","tt0101811","440","6","Having watched this movie at least 50 times, I can find no fault in it."
"3526","tt0101811","440","7","The music, by famed composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a marvel."
"3527","tt0101811","441","1","This is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life."
"3528","tt0101811","441","2","The pacing, the camera work, the emotion, the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see."
"3529","tt0101811","441","3","It isn't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted."
"3530","tt0101811","441","4","The only flaw I can see about this film is that it wasn't captured in a more technically perfect film format."
"3531","tt0101811","441","5","It deserved Todd AO, Technicolor and the very finest sound format available."
"3532","tt0101811","441","6","An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter."
"3533","tt0101811","441","7","The gorgeous Italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard."
"3534","tt0101811","441","8","As it is, it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film."
"3535","tt0101811","441","9","I can't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite."
"3536","tt0101811","441","10","The transformations of the characters from contained, tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and I really should recommend it more often."
"3537","tt0101811","441","11","The casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, the acting is above reproach."
"3538","tt0101811","441","12","It is a film about middle age and the choices people make."
"3539","tt0101811","441","13","It is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness."
"3540","tt0101811","441","14","Watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you."
"3541","tt0101811","441","15","If you don't get it, perhaps you haven't lived enough, or something else is wrong with you."
"3542","tt0101811","442","1","This is what I call a growth movie."
"3543","tt0101811","442","2","Every character is different and better at the end and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a ""tub of love""."
"3544","tt0101811","442","3","Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes."
"3545","tt0101811","442","4","Even the men in this film go from being self centered to better men."
"3546","tt0101811","442","5","The book stayed very true to the novel, which is a plus in my book, since I am a librarian."
"3547","tt0101811","442","6","The scenery breath taking and the message of love genuine."
"3548","tt0101811","443","1","I first saw this movie back in the early '90's when it was first released."
"3549","tt0101811","443","2","Room With a View was also newly out."
"3550","tt0101811","443","3","Enchanted April had so much more to offer!"
"3551","tt0101811","443","4","I found it much more real and earthy, the characters more believable for being 'normal'."
"3552","tt0101811","443","5","By the end of the film I felt the same as I did when I first saw the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, I was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation, peace, liberty or love."
"3553","tt0101811","443","6","You get a sense throughout that Italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known, that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting."
"3554","tt0101811","443","7","But in the heat of the spring in April, everyone's lives loosen and unravel in line with the Victorian corsets and are slowly rebuilt to everyone's satisfaction."
"3555","tt0101811","443","8","What a little gem of a film!"
"3556","tt0101811","443","9","How come it isn't more well known."
"3557","tt0101811","444","1","This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a compliment."
"3558","tt0101811","444","2","Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E."
"3559","tt0101811","444","3","M."
"3560","tt0101811","444","4","Forster novels, this very Merchant Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992."
"3561","tt0101811","444","5","It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME."
"3562","tt0101811","444","6","Here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with self discovery."

"3564","tt0101811","444","8","Fisher Joan Plowright."
"3565","tt0101811","444","9","This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming, dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be."
"3566","tt0101811","444","10","Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent then relatively new to American audiences fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a living thing of near magical elements, full of quiet moments and wonder."

"3572","tt0101811","445","6","It' pure and simple, with no car chases, no animosities and no deaths."
"3573","tt0101811","445","7","It was made with care and in very good taste."
"3574","tt0101811","445","8","You cannot help but smile all through it except when you're crying happy tears!"

"3612","tt0101811","450","2","Unfortunately the movie was rather short, unusually so for a period piece, and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect."

"3623","tt0101811","451","1","If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England."

"3626","tt0101811","451","4","Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century, this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too."

"3642","tt0101811","453","4","This movie is very low key."
"3643","tt0101811","453","5","Seeing ""Enchanted April"" is a very healing experience."
"3644","tt0101811","453","6","The sound track and gorgeous scenery, along with the ladies' gentle manners, bring to mind the peace and beauty of a pre Raphaelite painting."
"3645","tt0101811","453","7","Lest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie, I will paraphrase a line I heard once on ""Saturday Night Live"" and say that my two favorite movies are ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Enchanted April""."

"3690","tt0102388","2302","4","I actually gained some respect for Reese to know who she was so early on."
"3691","tt0102388","2302","5","I say that because whenever I have watched her perform, the characters thus far, in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character, quite nicely in fact."
"3692","tt0102388","2302","6","Anyway, my first film experience with Reese was the Little Red Riding Hood parody Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland, somehow I assumed that was her first time up ""at bat"" Not so, well done Reese"

"3696","tt0102388","2303","4","Witherspoon already begins to show the Oscar winning talent she would develop in this early role and London makes a charming leading man."
"3697","tt0102388","2303","5","Warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well."
"3698","tt0102388","2303","6","Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the girls' parents and Gail Strickland, who plays London's mom."
"3699","tt0102388","2303","7","I was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase ""family ties."""
"3700","tt0102388","2304","1","I thought this movie was very well done."
"3701","tt0102388","2304","2","Taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked accurate to me."
"3702","tt0102388","2304","3","It was well cast and believable."
"3703","tt0102388","2304","4","I don't usually care much for this type of movie, because they just don't have any depth, but I felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt, you got to really know them and care about them."

"3710","tt0102388","2305","1","I thought this was a very good movie."
"3711","tt0102388","2305","2","It would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off."
"3712","tt0102388","2305","3","I'm sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending, that's why this made this move such a good movie."
"3713","tt0102388","2305","4","It shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings that you can always get thru it and that if it's 2 sisters dealing with a boy, the same boy that working thru the pain and hurt makes things to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them."
"3714","tt0102388","2305","5","It's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still get thru it become even closer after its over."

"3717","tt0102388","2305","8","It would have been nice if there would have been a part 2 for this movie, maybe having the older sister to come up and have his baby, this would really have made a great finish to the story since he died, this way it would keep him alive even though he's dead."

"3723","tt0102388","2306","6","The Man in the Moon is superbly made, a gentle hearted, joyous and tragic film, beautifully filmed, one in which the actors truly live in the moment rather than act."
"3724","tt0102388","2306","7","This sweet tale shortly will be in our private library."
"3725","tt0102388","2306","8","This beautiful story of life in a far finer era in rural Louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral setting."
"3726","tt0102388","2306","9","It's hard to remain stoic during the film's last moments, particularly when the young girl the extent of her older sister's heart searing private pain and forgives all."
"3727","tt0102388","2306","10","Rather than spoil the enjoyment or bore you to sobs with my dull prose, will end now with this suggestion from one who enjoys films which speak from the heart to ours."

"3732","tt0102388","2306","15","Paul Vincent ZecchinoManasota Key, Florida05 April, 2009"
"3733","tt0102388","2307","1","i must say this movie is truly amazing and heartwarming."
"3734","tt0102388","2307","2","Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London's not so bad either!"
"3735","tt0102388","2307","3","it is so sweet watching Dani fall in love and it breaks my heart and yet warms my heart at the same time watching Court fall in love with Maureen. however it is even sweeter watching how much he cares for Dani."
"3736","tt0102388","2307","4","I must admit though i did kind of want him to fall for Dani in the end. it is just so cute watching her fall for him i did not want her to get her heart broken so badly. but the biggest tragedy i have ever seen occurred in this movie. watching him die made me cry for a whole day. i just could not believe it. however never a more loving relationship has been shown in a movie then Maureen and Dani. they really can make it through anything. i am giving this movie a 9 because i didn't want Court to die but it was still one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen."
"3737","tt0102388","2308","1","I checked this out as an impulse when browsing through the movie store and couldn't have been any more pleasantly surprised!"
"3738","tt0102388","2308","2","My mom and I watched this film together, and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
"3739","tt0102388","2308","3","It isn't the typical ""chick flick"" with a sappy love story and tears all the way through, but it definitely touches a nerve in the twist at the end."
"3740","tt0102388","2308","4","It's an ending where, although unexpected and tragic, the movie's overall effect is not harmed by it."
"3741","tt0102388","2308","5","I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress even in this film, her debut, and this is definitely worth watching!"
"3742","tt0102388","2308","6","I didn't recognize many of the supporting actors, but they all play their important supporting roles well."
"3743","tt0102388","2308","7","""The Man in the Moon"" is such an believable story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time."
"3744","tt0102388","2308","8","Most women can definitely relate to everything from Witherspoon's words, her subtle glances, and her not so subtle emotions raging like the typical teenage girl."
"3745","tt0102388","2308","9","While she's playing a character confused about love, she does not come across as silly and immature, which was much appreciated considering many movies today."
"3746","tt0102388","2309","1","It was life changing, IT REALLY WAS!!!"
"3747","tt0102388","2309","2","The Man In The Moon is a breathtaking experience to watch."
"3748","tt0102388","2309","3","The acting was fabulous, the story line was great, and this was a perfect start for Reese Witherspoon's career."
"3749","tt0102388","2309","4","I don't see how anyone couldn't love this film."
"3750","tt0102388","2309","5","Sure, it's not the best movie ever, even though it was close to it, but it was highly amusing to watch, and I even had a big laugh at one of the jokes, and a lot of other little laughs."
"3751","tt0102388","2309","6","Of course, there was some cry your heart out moments too, but this movie was enlightening, and it brightens up your day, although you have to get a little depressed from the story every now and then."
"3752","tt0102388","2309","7","I can't believe this movie didn't win at least one award, and I also can't believe that it's been seen by so little people on this site."
"3753","tt0102388","2309","8","See this movie if you haven't for it is definitely touching."
"3754","tt0102388","2310","1","I was so surprised by how great The Man In The Moon truly was."
"3755","tt0102388","2310","2","I mean at first I was kinda expecting a cheesy, and predictable film, but I decided to put that aside when watching."
"3756","tt0102388","2310","3","Well, when it was over I was just left stunnedmainly in tears, by how great The Man In The Moon turned out to be."
"3757","tt0102388","2310","4","This movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone, and its just a fabulous film."
"3758","tt0102388","2310","5","The acting was great especially from Reece Witherspoonwho was so cute and lovable, and everyone else."
"3759","tt0102388","2310","6","There wasn't anything that really bothered me, I felt the ending kinda predictable, but very well done at that."
"3760","tt0102388","2310","7","Also I felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before, but still a great film."
"3761","tt0102388","2310","8","Overall I must say I don't to much to say about this film, not that it was bad, its just a film you either like or don't like."
"3762","tt0102388","2310","9","I would however recommend this to any and everyone, even if you don't like these type of films, its still an enjoyable film.8.7 out of 10 stars"
"3763","tt0102388","2311","1","Reese Witherspooon's first movie."
"3764","tt0102388","2311","2","Loved it."
"3765","tt0102388","2311","3","The plot and the acting was top notch."
"3766","tt0102388","2311","4","You are emotionally involved with the characters."
"3767","tt0102388","2311","5","In my opinion, a must see."
"3768","tt0102388","2311","6","After watching this movie you will see why Reese Witherspoon's acting career has been so successful."
"3769","tt0102388","2311","7","The other cast members do a great job also."
"3770","tt0102388","2311","8","The movie flows extremely well."
"3771","tt0102388","2311","9","There is not a boring moment in the whole picture."
"3772","tt0102388","2311","10","The Man in the Moon's length is just right."
"3773","tt0102388","2311","11","As I said earlier, I think this movie was excellent."
"3774","tt0102388","2311","12","I have seen it numerous times, and have enjoyed every one of the viewings."
"3775","tt0102388","2312","1","A young man named Court is loved by everyone."
"3776","tt0102388","2312","2","His painful bloody death brings everyone closer."
"3777","tt0102388","2312","3","You can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie."
"3778","tt0102388","2312","4","Whether predictable or not, and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs, this is a moving story, full of milieu and sensuality."
"3779","tt0102388","2312","5","One other thing, someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didn't seem plausible."
"3780","tt0102388","2312","6","But the elements for this are set up subtly."
"3781","tt0102388","2312","7","Note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field."
"3782","tt0102388","2312","8","Note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves."
"3783","tt0102388","2312","9","He is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment."
"3784","tt0102388","2312","10","To this day, tractors are pretty dangerous."
"3785","tt0102388","2313","1","This ""coming of age"" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love one fateful summer."
"3786","tt0102388","2313","2","Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his superb work in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" the film never hits a false note."
"3787","tt0102388","2313","3","All the acting is superb."
"3788","tt0102388","2313","4","As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a stunning film debut."
"3789","tt0102388","2313","5","Watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film, I felt like I was looking through a window to reality, rather than watching a movie."
"3790","tt0102388","2313","6","I have watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the single best movies ever made about being young, being in love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood."
"3791","tt0102388","2313","7","Families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together, and use it as a discussion piece, as it raises a number of issues about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc."
"3792","tt0102388","2314","1","I had heard good things about this film and was, you guessed it, a bit disappointed."
"3793","tt0102388","2314","2","Reese Witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, at a young age; really all the small cast are quite solid, in their simple 50s American setting."
"3794","tt0102388","2314","3","The reason I didn't rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end, the grief shown by the older sister didn't seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit."
"3795","tt0102388","2314","4","Perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot, or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer."
"3796","tt0102388","2314","5","Maureen's character is quite underdeveloped I think."
"3797","tt0102388","2314","6","It is understandable that Dani Reese W., the younger would be traumatised and angry, but why is her sister shown to be more upset."
"3798","tt0102388","2314","7","Because she's a few years older."
"3799","tt0102388","2314","8","Hasn't the end rather undermined the rest of the film."
"3800","tt0102388","2314","9","The pacing of the movie makes it seem that Maureen and Court have only just met, when he gets tractored warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit. well it works!."
"3801","tt0102388","2314","10","It depends what you want if you want the girls' happy story of young love that it seems like you're going to get, you're in for a surprise."
"3802","tt0102388","2314","11","Man in the Moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination."
"3803","tt0102388","2314","12","I liked the character of Court though, I can see what girls watching this might be watching."
"3804","tt0102388","2314","13","And I loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would, most films wouldn't and get killed.7/10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale."
"3805","tt0102388","2314","14","For some reason I found Jason London on a tractor funny."
"3806","tt0102388","2315","1","There is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise."
"3807","tt0102388","2315","2","Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by Reese Witherspoon."
"3808","tt0102388","2315","3","That her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed."
"3809","tt0102388","2315","4","Robert Mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work."
"3810","tt0102388","2315","5","Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its best."
"3811","tt0102388","2316","1","I watched this movie by chance, get curious by the trailer on TV."
"3812","tt0102388","2316","2","I like when I discover movies like this, little, tender stories about ordinary people."
"3813","tt0102388","2316","3","Even if the end is tragic, ""The Man in the Moon"" has some funny moments, especially in the first characterization of Dani, with her innocent and pure love affair with Court."
"3814","tt0102388","2316","4","It's really a beautiful, moving love story with 3 high points: the performance of Reese Witherspoon, who maintained her promises in the world of cinema, the beautiful cinematography by the ""Old Lion"" Freddie Francis and the fantastic score by James Newton Howard, which is really the soul of the movie."
"3815","tt0102388","2316","5","His themes which deserved an Oscar nomination are so intimate and lyric that it seems they had transformed the screenplay in music."
"3816","tt0102388","2317","1","Loved the film!"
"3817","tt0102388","2317","2","This was my first glimpse at both Reese Witherspoon and Jason London, both of which are two of my favorites."
"3818","tt0102388","2317","3","Must say that no matter how many times I've seen this movie I can't help but tear up."
"3819","tt0102388","2317","4","One of those movies that should become a classic for all."
"3820","tt0102388","2318","1","I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14 year old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957."
"3821","tt0102388","2318","2","She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen a now rarely seen Emily Warfield, and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing."
"3822","tt0102388","2318","3","Then seventeen year old Court Foster Jason London, the son of her mother's close friend Gail Strickland moves in next door, Dani experiences her first crush, while Court enjoys her company, and willful spirit."
"3823","tt0102388","2318","4","Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving Dani behind."
"3824","tt0102388","2318","5","The sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts, which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident."
"3825","tt0102388","2318","6","The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other."
"3826","tt0102388","2318","7","Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents, trying to balance their daughters' individuality, at the same time trying to keep the family together."
"3827","tt0102388","2318","8","The beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time."
"3828","tt0102388","2318","9","A touching coming of age film with a timeless message."
"3829","tt0102388","2319","1","It's a generic coming of age story think ""The Member of the Wedding,"" ""Summer of '42,"" ""A Summer Place,"" even ""Little Women"" and there are moments where Mulligan might have omitted the soupy music, not used slow motion, or played down the golden lit prettiness of the setting."
"3830","tt0102388","2319","2","Otherwise, it's done with rare emotional perfect pitch."
"3831","tt0102388","2319","3","Nothing's forced, every line has feeling, and the pacing is just right."
"3832","tt0102388","2319","4","Even the below A list casting helps: Bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material."
"3833","tt0102388","2319","5","In particular, Witherspoon is excellent: Her line readings are fresh and original, and her body language is just right for a gawky, hoydenish 14 year old on the eve of womanhood."
"3834","tt0102388","2319","6","Waterston is also very fine, even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck."
"3835","tt0102388","2319","7","One senses that the film's makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects no big stars, no big car crashes, no special effects and consciously decided to make the best possible movie, box office be damned."
"3836","tt0102388","2319","8","It's intimate and honest, and it sticks to the ribs."
"3837","tt0102388","2319","9","If you find yourself misting up at the end, you don't have to feel you've been duped."
"3838","tt0102388","2320","1","Not only is this movie a great film for basic cinematography screenplay, acting, setting, etc. but also for it's realism."
"3839","tt0102388","2320","2","This movie could take place in any farm or rural setting."
"3840","tt0102388","2320","3","It makes no difference if the movie takes place in Louisiana or if it would take place in Kansas."
"3841","tt0102388","2320","4","The story and the messages it includes would remain the same."
"3842","tt0102388","2320","5","This movie shows family values and connections for an older audience, while at the same time it shows youthful behavior for the younger viewers."
"3843","tt0102388","2320","6","Everyone who watches this will walk away with something having touched them personally, I know I did."
"3844","tt0102388","2320","7","The ending hits way too close to home for me not to burst into tears every time I watch it."
"3845","tt0102388","2320","8","The ending stresses the importance of farm safety, and everyone who has ever worked on a farm needs to see this film."
"3846","tt0102388","2320","9","Not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations."
"3847","tt0102388","2321","1","Here's the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching."
"3848","tt0102388","2321","2","And mostly, it's for two reasons."
"3849","tt0102388","2321","3","One, it concentrates of young people, VERY young people."
"3850","tt0102388","2321","4","People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are."
"3851","tt0102388","2321","5","All of us have been there in our lives and ""The Man in the Moon"" is a magnificent reflection upon our memories, maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced."
"3852","tt0102388","2321","6","The second reason is that is a love triangle."
"3853","tt0102388","2321","7","And I do believe that as teens, it's the most dramatic."
"3854","tt0102388","2321","8","And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love, or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs, will believe it for the rest of their lives."
"3855","tt0102388","2321","9","The cast of ""The Man in the Moon"" is full of great talented names."
"3856","tt0102388","2321","10","It stars Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict, yet caring and wise fathers as in this film."
"3857","tt0102388","2321","11","Also there is Tess Harper, Jason London, and a young, young Reese Witherspoon."
"3858","tt0102388","2321","12","You look at the young, talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road, she's going to win the Academy Award."
"3859","tt0102388","2321","13","All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay, they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations."
"3860","tt0102388","2321","14","As if it all really happened."
"3861","tt0102388","2321","15","This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often."
"3862","tt0102388","2321","16","Love story or not."
"3863","tt0102388","2321","17","I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way."
"3864","tt0102388","2322","1","That magical moment in life, that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood, and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood . . . this is what this movie is all about."
"3865","tt0102388","2322","2","Danni wonderfully played by Reese Witherspoon is right at that moment in life when the movie starts."
"3866","tt0102388","2322","3","She swoons over Elvis, playing his records and wishfully thinking about love."
"3867","tt0102388","2322","4","Maureen her sister will soon be off to college, has no trouble with attracting boys, is beautiful, and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn't."
"3868","tt0102388","2322","5","She dates a local loser whos father is also after her, and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet."
"3869","tt0102388","2322","6","Danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn't good enough."
"3870","tt0102388","2322","7","She wants to be Maureen but doesn't see that she is beautiful herself."
"3871","tt0102388","2322","8","The moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets Court Foster for the first time."
"3872","tt0102388","2322","9","Court whos father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers."
"3873","tt0102388","2322","10","He has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun."
"3874","tt0102388","2322","11","On one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find Danni skinny dipping."
"3875","tt0102388","2322","12","They yell and argue and Danni leaves."

"3883","tt0102388","2322","20","One look between the two and its all over."
"3884","tt0102388","2322","21","The looks of pain and defeat on Danni's face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time."
"3885","tt0102388","2322","22","The rest of the movie I will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sisters."
"3886","tt0102388","2322","23","The greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love, and the pain they must endure both together and individually."
"3887","tt0102388","2322","24","Danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair, painful, and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started."
"3888","tt0102388","2322","25","Few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly."

"3919","tt0102388","2326","3","This was truly a heartbreaking story about first love."

"3924","tt0102388","2327","2","That is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic coming of age film from Director Robert Mulligan."
"3925","tt0102388","2327","3","Mulligan is famous for previously directing Summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the coming of age genre."

"3930","tt0102388","2327","8","Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist."
"3931","tt0102388","2327","9","The music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive."
"3932","tt0102388","2327","10","The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director Freddie Francis, who was in his 70's when this was shot."

"3938","tt0102388","2328","1","Perfect movies are rare."
"3939","tt0102388","2328","2","Even my favorite films tend to have flaws Rear Window looks a little stagey at times, Chris Elliot's character in Groundhog Day doesn't work, the music score in Best Years of Our Lives is too cheesy, the beginning of Nights of Cabiria is a little too slow but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish."
"3940","tt0102388","2328","3","The script is brilliant, the acting is superb all around although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines, the directing and the photography are inspired, and the music score is touching without being intrusive like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative."
"3941","tt0102388","2328","4","Every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile."
"3942","tt0102388","2328","5","This truly is one of the best films I have ever seen and I wish there were more films like it."
"3943","tt0102388","2328","6","I am glad that Reese Witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film, but I am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems."
"3944","tt0102388","2328","7","Brilliant!"

"3986","tt0102951","1133","11","Just a great movie if you're in the mood to go along for the ride and LAUGH!"
"3987","tt0102951","1134","1","The only part lacking in this movie is Shue's part as the daughter wanting to follow in her ""aunt's"" footsteps as a daytime soap star."
"3988","tt0102951","1134","2","Otherwise it would be a perfect 10."
"3989","tt0102951","1134","3","It seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script I have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing wasn't taking place in parts."
"3990","tt0102951","1134","4","It was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with you."
"3991","tt0102951","1134","5","It's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once."
"3992","tt0102951","1134","6","I'd recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose."
"3993","tt0102951","1134","7","You'll definitely want to watch the last scene closely, 'Nurse Nan' has a little secret she'd rather not have shared with you."
"3994","tt0102951","1134","8","If you love daytime soaps or despise them, this move pokes fun in all the right places."
"3995","tt0102951","1135","1","I first saw this in the movie theater when it came out, and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun."
"3996","tt0102951","1135","2","This is a great cast of characters, many big names in it, a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now."
"3997","tt0102951","1135","3","I think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors, or have loved them in other movies, to add it to your watched list."
"3998","tt0102951","1135","4","Some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well done comedy as in The Birdcage or even The Clue, kind of odd spontaneous appearing comedy, with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors."
"3999","tt0102951","1135","5","The movie did a great job at giving you some insight, perhaps even very realistic, into the culture of a daytime soap."
"4000","tt0102951","1136","1","I'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler, but I'm playing it safe, so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie."
"4001","tt0102951","1136","2","I adore this movie, and so does everyone I work with and that is the point."
"4002","tt0102951","1136","3","I spent a large part of my working life in cinema, without being an actor."
"4003","tt0102951","1136","4","Such people are the _sung_ heroes of this movie: the gaffers, the pullers, the on air directors, the lighters and writers, the costume people etc etc, and the whole thing is told from their point of view, at least to a great extent."
"4004","tt0102951","1136","5","Most actors are nuts and self absorbed to the point of absurdity, which is what this movie spoofs so well, but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real life drama!"
"4005","tt0102951","1136","6","Possible spoiler alert: in one great scene, the two leads, both actors, are _discussing_ how to _discuss_ something personal, something entirely 'out of script', with another actor, and they start making up lines, rehearsing them, and critiquing each other's performance."
"4006","tt0102951","1136","7","Since this movie appeared in, what was it, '91, it has become fashionable to do this, especially on TV."
"4007","tt0102951","1136","8","But hardly anyone has done it so well."
"4008","tt0102951","1137","1","It's very very funny."
"4009","tt0102951","1137","2","You know, just like a comedy is supposed to be."
"4010","tt0102951","1137","3","It also looks very very good, like a Hollywood Spectacular should."
"4011","tt0102951","1137","4","So, what more do you want."
"4012","tt0102951","1137","5","Howz about a very VERY good Sally Fields."
"4013","tt0102951","1137","6","She is so much better here than in anything else I've ever seen her in, and she looks so damn good."
"4014","tt0102951","1137","7","This movie is all you need to understand why she's a Star."
"4015","tt0102951","1137","8","Those eyes!"
"4016","tt0102951","1137","9","Like a silent movie star, but better."
"4017","tt0102951","1137","10","In fact, everyone's eyes are so good."
"4018","tt0102951","1137","11","I used to pretend to be a bad TV soap actor with my girlfriend."
"4019","tt0102951","1137","12","We'd do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner."
"4020","tt0102951","1137","13","They don't do that at all in Soap Dish."
"4021","tt0102951","1137","14","Great."
"4022","tt0102951","1137","15","The Eyes Have It!"
"4023","tt0102951","1137","16","sorry There's so many terrific performances, its fun just waiting for each of them to reappear."
"4024","tt0102951","1137","17","There's a whole workshop going on with Kevin Kline on how to Overact very very subtly."
"4025","tt0102951","1137","18","Got that."
"4026","tt0102951","1137","19","Yeah, he's damn good."
"4027","tt0102951","1137","20","So is Robert Downey, Jr. who has since made sumthin of a career of playing the Slick, Slimy Executive."
"4028","tt0102951","1137","21","Cathy Moriarity, while not the most gifted actress, is so charismatic and riveting, especially when she's angry."
"4029","tt0102951","1137","22","And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, her natural timing giving here somewhat flat delivery a little Zing."
"4030","tt0102951","1137","23","OK, no Whoopi Bashing, I hear ya."
"4031","tt0102951","1137","24","And then, there's the Hair."
"4032","tt0102951","1137","25","Soap Dish was made at the end of the BIG Hair Eighties, so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in themselves."
"4033","tt0102951","1137","26","They get bigger and sillier, just like your's did."
"4034","tt0102951","1137","27","Yeah, we got pictures."
"4035","tt0102951","1137","28","Soap Dish is better than I thought it'd be, better that I wanted it to be."
"4036","tt0102951","1137","29","I'm sick of Movies that tell me I'm supposed to care about shallow, self centered, semi talented egomaniacs, ie."
"4037","tt0102951","1137","30","TV Soap Actors."
"4038","tt0102951","1137","31","Soap Dish seems happy just to have me laugh at 'em."
"4039","tt0102951","1137","32","Thank You."
"4040","tt0102951","1138","1","When I was a kid of 8, I always watched movies and television that i wasn't supposed to, and this was one of them."
"4041","tt0102951","1138","2","It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and it has to be the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life, the acting is excellent, they Don't Make Comedies Like This Anymore these days movies that are ACTUALLY funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of vomit inducing body fluid as in those retarded Judd Apatow movies starring unfunny non actors like Seth Rogen, barf."
"4042","tt0102951","1138","3","This movie is a classic with actors who can actually act, and deserve all the accolades."
"4043","tt0102951","1139","1","There are few comedies like this, where almost every line and every character come close to flawless."
"4044","tt0102951","1139","2","This is soooo funny!!"
"4045","tt0102951","1139","3","And it has quite a bit of satire there to."
"4046","tt0102951","1139","4","Sally Field is heading the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good, if not perfect, job with her daytime tv diva."
"4047","tt0102951","1139","5","Sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top, but 90 % of the time she is a riot!"
"4048","tt0102951","1139","6","In the same league is Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg who unfortunately has too little to do here."
"4049","tt0102951","1139","7","Downey jr may not convince entirely as a comedian and has not the timing right all the time, but he struggles with his part which is, to be honest, the most ungrateful one."
"4050","tt0102951","1139","8","But the shining star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a true bitch if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret you will see in the absolutely stunning finale!."
"4051","tt0102951","1139","9","Sadly Elisabeth Shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part."
"4052","tt0102951","1139","10","I normally like Ms Shue, but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie."
"4053","tt0102951","1139","11","But it is not something damaging and for the most part she is at least adequate."
"4054","tt0102951","1139","12","Otherwise, brimming with memorable lines and situations, this is a comedy to watch whenever it is on TV or wherever."
"4055","tt0102951","1140","1","I have been a fan of this movie for years and years."
"4056","tt0102951","1140","2","Because of Teri Hatchers move into the forefront, I had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it."
"4057","tt0102951","1140","3","Why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me."
"4058","tt0102951","1140","4","Sally Field and Kevin Kline are beyond fabulous."
"4059","tt0102951","1140","5","Although I never have watching daytime soap operas, this movie kills me every time I watch it."
"4060","tt0102951","1140","6","The acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart."
"4061","tt0102951","1140","7","I highly recommend that you watch this if you haven't already."
"4062","tt0102951","1140","8","You will get to see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, and Carrie Fisher...to name a few...all give splendid performances."
"4063","tt0102951","1141","1","Anyone who doesn't laugh all through this movie has been embalmed."
"4064","tt0102951","1141","2","I have watched it at least twenty times and I still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes."
"4065","tt0102951","1141","3","Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise."
"4066","tt0102951","1141","4","Fields, at 45, still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children."
"4067","tt0102951","1141","5","I'm biased, I'm in love with her."
"4068","tt0102951","1141","6","The cast of ""Soapdish"" is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection."
"4069","tt0102951","1141","7","Kevin Kline is flawless, as are Robert Downey Jr., an ingénue Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of her early roles, Carrie Fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on."
"4070","tt0102951","1141","8","Kathy Najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer, and best of all, Cathy Moriarty as Nurse Nan who leads the plot to get Fields character removed from the show is hilarious."
"4071","tt0102951","1141","9","This movie should have won Oscars for best comedy, best leading lady in a comedy, best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses."
"4072","tt0102951","1141","10","Get the DVD so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years."
"4073","tt0102951","1141","11","You will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out."
"4074","tt0102951","1142","1","till HBO began rerunning it this month."
"4075","tt0102951","1142","2","I remember laughing out loud in the theater back in 1991, and now again in my living room."
"4076","tt0102951","1142","3","If I see that it's on, I have to watch it."
"4077","tt0102951","1142","4","There's just no question."
"4078","tt0102951","1142","5","This is so much more entertaining to me than other, more popular spoofs like Airplane!"
"4079","tt0102951","1142","6","which I really like, BTW."
"4080","tt0102951","1142","7","Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion."
"4081","tt0102951","1142","8","Quotes like ""Sudden speech!"
"4082","tt0102951","1142","9","The last symptoms of brain fever!"
"4083","tt0102951","1142","10","She could blow at any moment!"""
"4084","tt0102951","1142","11","put me over the edge."
"4085","tt0102951","1142","12","And Whoopie Goldberg hasn't been this funny since 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'."
"4086","tt0102951","1142","13","Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr. all turn in superb performances as expected."
"4087","tt0102951","1142","14","I started out giving this 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that for the type of film it's supposed to be, there isn't one thing I'd change or improve upon."
"4088","tt0102951","1142","15","So 10 it is."
"4089","tt0102951","1142","16","I have to get this on DVD, that's just all there is to it."
"4090","tt0102951","1143","1","I don't watch soaps."
"4091","tt0102951","1143","2","My grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass."
"4092","tt0102951","1143","3","I made fun of them it when I was ten it was so easy."
"4093","tt0102951","1143","4","But this movie takes parody and spells it a new way."
"4094","tt0102951","1143","5","I found the story pretty damn funny."
"4095","tt0102951","1143","6","The fashions of the 80's shoulder pads, sequins, and polyester just top it off."
"4096","tt0102951","1143","7","The huge hair, the high heels, and the histrionics what a combination."
"4097","tt0102951","1143","8","And all the actors just go to town, chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile."
"4098","tt0102951","1143","9","Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth wonderful!"
"4099","tt0102951","1143","10","Whoopi great!"
"4100","tt0102951","1143","11","Robert Downey refreshing to see him back when he had such potential, before the tabloids."
"4101","tt0102951","1143","12","And Garry: why did we have to wait so long to see him on film."
"4102","tt0102951","1143","13","Leesa Gibbons hadn't been missing her, but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter and where do you apply for THAT job, anyway.."
"4103","tt0102951","1143","14","Admittedly, I could have done without Sally climbing the drainpipe."
"4104","tt0102951","1143","15","Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times., as has every comedienne from Carol Burnett to I don't know who and I'm so done with it now, I could spit peanuts if I had them."
"4105","tt0102951","1143","16","Apparently it's what you do when you're being funny in a tall building in New York."
"4106","tt0102951","1143","17","I'm just thankful they didn't pull out the flagpole bit."
"4107","tt0102951","1143","18","But it was cute, it was funny, it had plot twists, it had an after credits ending before that was common, it had clothes worthy of a second glance, it had a great cast and it's got personal memories for me."
"4108","tt0102951","1143","19","Really, what more do you need."
"4109","tt0102951","1144","1","Way back in 1955, the British made a comedy called Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kay Kendall."
"4110","tt0102951","1144","2","To this day, it stands as one of the finest examples of British comedy and, more particularly, about how television sitcoms become so popular."
"4111","tt0102951","1144","3","It was, and is, an excellent example also of self referential cinema."
"4112","tt0102951","1144","4","So also Soapdish, a film I'd never heard about until a few nights ago when I caught it on late TV."
"4113","tt0102951","1144","5","I was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well, as you know."
"4114","tt0102951","1144","6","However, I was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime American TV."
"4115","tt0102951","1144","7","In fact, it's been a while since I laughed so heartily."
"4116","tt0102951","1144","8","So, if you like satire, I'd recommend you see it."
"4117","tt0102951","1144","9","The main actors  Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty  quite simply do an excellent job, revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is."
"4118","tt0102951","1144","10","As I watched it, I kept thinking to myself: just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life."
"4119","tt0102951","1144","11","That is, if actors ever do have a real life."
"4120","tt0102951","1144","12","As you probably know, Peter Sellers, for example, was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters, so that nobody really knew the real person."
"4121","tt0102951","1144","13","So, as I watched Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot playing Maggie, I thought again about that earlier British film with Kay Kendall playing Laura playing a character in a TV sitcom opposite Peter Finch..."
"4122","tt0102951","1144","14","Is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns."
"4123","tt0102951","1144","15","And that feeling was crystallized when Celeste finally confronts her daughter Lori, played by Elizabeth Shue and, in an emotional moment, repeats the fictional lines she'd used, on a prior episode of her daytime soap, when confronting her fictional daughter in that show!"
"4124","tt0102951","1144","16","Are you confused."
"4125","tt0102951","1144","17","Well, it's not all like that, but the dialog is stunning for originality, comedy, bitchiness, anger, depravity, duplicity, and even...love."
"4126","tt0102951","1144","18","The story."
"4127","tt0102951","1144","19","Well, there are many stories in this film, all interwoven, and which all come together at the end of course  but not like a Robert Altman film, okay!, and not all of them are resolved finally."
"4128","tt0102951","1144","20","Life's not like that anyway, right."
"4129","tt0102951","1144","21","The pace is almost frenetic, and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes."
"4130","tt0102951","1144","22","Spend the 97 minutes from your life and watch it; you won't regret the time usage."
"4131","tt0102951","1144","23","The rest of the cast all perform well, although I've never taken much to Whoopi Goldberg."
"4132","tt0102951","1144","24","Perhaps the funniest exchanges are between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and, for my money, the latter steals so many scenes from others, she gets my vote as the outstanding player."
"4133","tt0102951","1144","25","I kid you not, she gives the term bitch an entirely new face..."
"4134","tt0102951","1145","1","This is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change."
"4135","tt0102951","1145","2","As usual the lovers Sally Field as almost over the hill soap opera queen, Celeste Talbert; and Kevin Kline as marginally employed and marginally talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson are working at cross purposes, seemingly unaware that they are madly in love, etc."
"4136","tt0102951","1145","3","Owing a little to Bette Davis's Margo Channing in All About Eve 1950 and a whole lot to the slapstick theatrical tradition, Sally Field goes over the top towards hilarity as she malaprops her way to love and happiness."
"4137","tt0102951","1145","4","Kevin Kline, one of the more underrated leading men of recent years, is also very good and very winning as he manages to be handsome, vulnerable, egotistical and lovable all at the same time."
"4138","tt0102951","1145","5","The misadventures center around Celeste's fear of losing her audience as she has entered her forties, and reach the crisis point with the arrival of her niece, aspiring actress Cori Craven Elisabeth Shue who turns out NOT to be her niece, with ensuing plot complications."
"4139","tt0102951","1145","6","Cori manages to get a small part in the soap opera as a homeless deaf mute before discovering her true relationship to Celeste and to Jeffrey Anderson as well but never mind."
"4140","tt0102951","1145","7","As a romantic counterpoint or foil to the leads are Robert Downey Jr. soap opera director, David Barnes and Cathy Moriarty Montana and Nurse Nan."
"4141","tt0102951","1145","8","David Barnes is oh so hot for her, but she cares only about one thing: getting rid of Celeste so that she might shine more brightly on the set."
"4142","tt0102951","1145","9","To this end she gets Barnes to do all sorts of things to wreck Celeste's career, but through happenstance and/or a perverse logic, all his attempts go awry, much to the delight of the viewer."
"4143","tt0102951","1145","10","Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, the show's chief writer and Celeste's alter ego and confidant while Carrie Fisher has a modest part as the hard as nails producer of the show."
"4144","tt0102951","1145","11","I thought this was funnier than the only other spoof of the soap opera world that I have seen Young Doctors in Love 1982 which burlesqued TV's General Hospital and was pretty good."
"4145","tt0102951","1145","12","Soapdish is funnier with a daffy script and plenty of laugh out loud one liners and terrific performances by Field, Kline and Downy, Jr."
"4146","tt0102951","1145","13","But see this for Sally Field who is outstanding."
"4147","tt0102951","1146","1","This movie is about a fictional soap opera."
"4148","tt0102951","1146","2","It is very fast and funny."
"4149","tt0102951","1146","3","To say anything else would ruin the movie."
"4150","tt0102951","1146","4","There are several plots and sub plots in the movie."
"4151","tt0102951","1146","5","This movie has ensemble cast with today's hottest stars."
"4152","tt0102951","1146","6","They all gives over the top performances."
"4153","tt0102951","1146","7","This movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991."
"4154","tt0102951","1146","8","Soapdish is perfect for fans of either daytime soap opera /or prime time soap opera!!!"
"4155","tt0102951","1146","9","If you watch soap go check this movie it's hilarious!!!"
"4156","tt0102951","1147","1","Soapdish may go down as one of the single most under rated movies ever made."
"4157","tt0102951","1147","2","A stellar, unselfish cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it."
"4158","tt0102951","1147","3","While everyone hammed it up, there was no one upmanship."
"4159","tt0102951","1147","4","Kline showed wit and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking, I could just go on."
"4160","tt0102951","1147","5","Do not pass this movie by!"
"4161","tt0102951","1148","1","This is one of those movies like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero that holds a viewer's interest time and again."
"4162","tt0102951","1148","2","Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars, but whoever did the casting for Soapdish deserves one."

"4232","tt0102951","1151","2","The film revolves around the various off camera drama's that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced Daytime Soap Opera."
"4233","tt0102951","1151","3","The first of the film's various impressive strengths is it's fantastic A List cast."
"4234","tt0102951","1151","4","'Soapdish' features some of the greatest actors and actresses of it's era."
"4235","tt0102951","1151","5","The film is superbly led by Sally Field, as the neurotic ageing actress Celeste Talbert She famously throws a tantrum when put in a costume that makes her look like ""Gloria FCKING Swanson!""."

"4237","tt0102951","1151","7","Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy all elevate the film greatly."

"4241","tt0102951","1151","11","There also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time."
"4242","tt0102951","1151","12","In some ways, the film is reminiscent of Mel Brooks at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of 'High Anxiety' 1977."
"4243","tt0102951","1151","13","Much of the film's humour hinges on it's often scathing, but pretty accurate, representations of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors."
"4244","tt0102951","1151","14","For example, The extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by Carrie Fisher, is both hilarious and honest.'"
"4245","tt0102951","1151","15","Soapdish' is, for my money, one of the very best comedies Hollywood produced during the 1990's."
"4246","tt0102951","1151","16","It's excellent script and A Class cast make it a must see."
"4247","tt0102951","1151","17","It's hard not to love this film after it's kept you laughing for 90 minutes."
"4248","tt0102951","1152","1","The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive Sally's flagging spirits is enough reason alone to enjoy this movie, but wait!"
"4249","tt0102951","1152","2","There's more!"
"4250","tt0102951","1152","3","This is a crackling good sendup of daytime TV, movie stars on the way down, and up and the horrors of love."
"4251","tt0102951","1152","4","Robert Downey Jr shows the lighter side of his genius, and Cathy Moriarty is splendid."
"4252","tt0102951","1152","5","The dialogue is witty, and the physical humor done with consummate skill."
"4253","tt0102951","1152","6","This is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting, directing, and writing."
"4254","tt0102951","1153","1","This has to be, hands down, hats off, one of the most uproarious comedies ever made."
"4255","tt0102951","1153","2","Starting with the animated blowing, popping bubbles, the entrance to the Daytime Awards, the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet, the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech, the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co stars and producer, under phony smiles."
"4256","tt0102951","1153","3","Now THAT is only in the first few minutes."
"4257","tt0102951","1153","4","Then, all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous."
"4258","tt0102951","1153","5","Ridiculous in a good way, no, make that a great way."
"4259","tt0102951","1153","6","This was the first time I'd seen the always charming Teri Hatcher."

"4261","tt0102951","1153","8","Not a huge follower, but if I run across an episode I'd watch it."
"4262","tt0102951","1153","9","Robert Downey, jr., does a great turn as slimy, smarmy, snaky, sycophantic David Seaton Barnes, the producer who'd give his right eye to see Sally Field's Celeste Talbert leave the show, if only to finally get to get it on with Cathy Moriarty's Montana Moorehead."
"4263","tt0102951","1153","10","Moriarty absolutely shines in this movie, just as she had everywhere else she's appeared."

"4265","tt0102951","1153","12","or give one of her anti Celeste co conspirators an evil grin, and she has me rolling in the aisles."
"4266","tt0102951","1153","13","Yes, Cathy Moriarty is a very gifted actress, and one hell of a comedienne."
"4267","tt0102951","1153","14","Sally Field gratefully departs from the usual 70 MM sized Lifetime Tragedy of the Week movies, and we're all reminded why she is who she is today, having started off in comedy afraid of nothing."
"4268","tt0102951","1153","15","Her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor, but like a caterpillar in a cocoon, the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was."
"4269","tt0102951","1153","16","The thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy, serious roles, that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen."
"4270","tt0102951","1153","17","How lucky were the producers to land Carrie Fisher, if only for a glorified cameo."
"4271","tt0102951","1153","18","She doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen."
"4272","tt0102951","1153","19","She takes a role which, in the hands of a lesser actress, could easily have been forgotten, but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself."
"4273","tt0102951","1153","20","How lucky was Elisabeth Shue to get thrown in the middle of all this!"
"4274","tt0102951","1153","21","At the time, she wasn't really known for much."
"4275","tt0102951","1153","22","Adventures in Babysitting was kind of cute yes, I was dragged to an evening show for which I had to pay full price, but she didn't hold my attention much."
"4276","tt0102951","1153","23","But here, she makes the most of her character star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex co star and lover who, of course, turns out to be the niece's father, and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother."
"4277","tt0102951","1153","24","I'll stop there I feel I practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy, or at least a novela."
"4278","tt0102951","1153","25","If you've seen it, then reminisce."
"4279","tt0102951","1153","26","If you haven't, you've missed a real classic, but not really."
"4280","tt0102951","1153","27","The DVD's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years, and this movie is timeless, so what the hell."
"4281","tt0102951","1154","1","I think that this is possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen."
"4282","tt0102951","1154","2","Robert Harling's script is near perfect, just check out the ""quotes"" section; on second thought, just rent the DVD, since it's the delivery that really makes the lines sing."
"4283","tt0102951","1154","3","Sally Field gives a comic, over the top performance like you've never seen from her anywhere else, and Kevin Kline is effortlessly hilarious."
"4284","tt0102951","1154","4","Robert Downey, Jr. is typically brilliant, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer."
"4285","tt0102951","1154","5","I was never much of a fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she's great here as the one real person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of ""The Sun Also Sets"" that rumbling you feel beneath you is Hemingway rolling over in his grave."
"4286","tt0102951","1154","6","Either that, or he's laughing really hard."

"4293","tt0102951","1155","5","I don't like soap operas, even though I never watch them."
"4294","tt0102951","1155","6","But I do love this film because it's so crazy and off the wall, that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television."
"4295","tt0102951","1155","7","In my opinion, it's the best film of 1991."
"4296","tt0102951","1156","1","Years ago I did follow a soap on TV."
"4297","tt0102951","1156","2","So I was curious about this movie, and I was so rewarded for finding it."
"4298","tt0102951","1156","3","It's a marvelous spoof of soaps, with jealousies, the usual actors' insecurities, and all sorts of lovely excesses."
"4299","tt0102951","1156","4","But more than anything an amazing cast and an incredible script."
"4300","tt0102951","1156","5","How did someone get all those top notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie."
"4301","tt0102951","1156","6","And how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines."
"4302","tt0102951","1156","7","I never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it, but it's marvelous and I highly recommend seeing it."
"4303","tt0102951","1156","8","Sometimes I'll throw it on while doing housecleaning, and end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing."
"4304","tt0102951","1156","9","Many congrats to all who made it."
"4305","tt0102951","1157","1","This is one of the best comedy ever !"
"4306","tt0102951","1157","2","The writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast, well just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it is so great."
"4307","tt0102951","1157","3","If you're a Kevin Kline fan, he does as always an fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr is perfect."
"4308","tt0102951","1157","4","If you don't laugh while seen this movie, you don't have any sense of humor."
"4309","tt0102951","1158","1","A riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas!"
"4310","tt0102951","1158","2","This film is hilarious!"
"4311","tt0102951","1158","3","Admittedly, you have to have a taste for films with screaming, hysterical dialogue, over the top acting, and melodramatic plot twists."
"4312","tt0102951","1158","4","But if you do, you're in for one hell of a treat."

"4315","tt0102951","1158","7","But Celeste has been hiding a deep, dark secret, and the arrival of Lori and Jeffrey might just bring it to the surface."
"4316","tt0102951","1158","8","Add in the diabolical Montana Moorehead a wonderful Cathy Moriarty, in full ""gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode"", who is trying mighty hard to destroy Celeste's career; David Robert Downey, Jr., the weenie boy producer of the soap who's secretly plotting with Montana to ruin Celeste; and, Rose Schwarz Whoopi Goldberg, scriptwriter and Celeste's one true confidant, and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaos."
"4317","tt0102951","1158","9","Chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute does anyone remember 'Mixed Nuts'., but when done well, can be pretty damn funny!"
"4318","tt0102951","1158","10","A major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look."
"4319","tt0102951","1158","11","Field, Kline, Goldberg, and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm."
"4320","tt0102951","1158","12","Shue is clearly the weakest link here, but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by Field, Kline, et al."

"4337","tt0102951","1160","5","Her toss off line ""God, you are so disGUSting"" as she climbs in his window great!"
"4338","tt0102951","1160","6","Kline's running into the door after scoping out Teri Hatcher great too!"
"4339","tt0102951","1160","7","Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work together flawlessly until he finds out who she really is... a soap opera turn if there every was one!"
"4340","tt0102951","1160","8","The scene near the end in the chinese dining area had my kids and I rolling on the floor that scene alone is worth the rental price."
"4341","tt0102951","1160","9","Doesn't solve any world problems or show the seemy underbelly of daytime T.V."
"4342","tt0102951","1160","10","I hope."
"4343","tt0102951","1160","11","Just a lot of fun."
"4344","tt0120157","3202","1","I can't understand why many IMDb users don't like this movie."
"4345","tt0120157","3202","2","Why they think it's sooooo bad etc."
"4346","tt0120157","3202","3","It's not worse than anything else out there."
"4347","tt0120157","3202","4","Personally I think ""Soldier"" is a great movie, far better than most other films in the same genre."
"4348","tt0120157","3202","5","Reasons why I liked ""Soldier"": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the script David Webb Peoples, great visual effects, and the directing Paul Anderson."
"4349","tt0120157","3202","6","I even think that this is the best work I've seen from director Paul Anderson, who has previously directed the entertaining ""Mortal Kombat"" and the not so entertaining ""Event Horizon""."
"4350","tt0120157","3203","1","I think that this film was one of Kurt Russels good movies."
"4351","tt0120157","3203","2","Kurt russel is my favorite actor so I think that he is a good actor in any role he plays."
"4352","tt0120157","3203","3","But this movie had a lot of action in it and I know that it should have more then a 5.6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie."
"4353","tt0120157","3203","4","Oh well I thought it was good so I think that every one should see this movie."
"4354","tt0120157","3203","5","If you see this movie and like it I think that you should see Back Draft also with Kurt Russel."
"4355","tt0120157","3203","6","I give Soldier  1/2 out of"
"4356","tt0120157","3204","1","I loved this movie and will watch it again."
"4357","tt0120157","3204","2","Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self."
"4358","tt0120157","3204","3","I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie."
"4359","tt0120157","3204","4","His eyes conveyed more than most actors words."
"4360","tt0120157","3204","5","Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention."
"4361","tt0120157","3205","1","I saw this in the theater and I instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video."
"4362","tt0120157","3205","2","I am a big nut for Sci Fi action flicks though anyway."
"4363","tt0120157","3205","3","Without giving any of the story away, it is worth seeing if you like Sci Fi without requiring much thought."
"4364","tt0120157","3205","4","The story is basic, and the plot is very good."
"4365","tt0120157","3205","5","Worth your time to see!"
"4366","tt0120157","3205","6","Maybe they will make a sequel. :8 out of 10"
"4367","tt0120157","3206","1","I really liked this movie."
"4368","tt0120157","3206","2","Kurt manages to act without speaking, letting moments speak for themselves."
"4369","tt0120157","3206","3","He doesn't have to verbalize or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and takes action."
"4370","tt0120157","3206","4","He is supported by a good cast of actors and settings, and is able to show us a more humane side of soldiers without getting to corny."
"4371","tt0120157","3207","1","Of course, by any normal standard of film criticism, Soldier is a very poor film indeed."
"4372","tt0120157","3207","2","Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a Gladiators contest without the crash mats."
"4373","tt0120157","3207","3","Abandoned on a junk planet, he's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening, family life and, um, breasts."
"4374","tt0120157","3207","4","Kurt doesn't talk much."
"4375","tt0120157","3207","5","Finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away."
"4376","tt0120157","3207","6","Kurt gets angry and kills everyone."
"4377","tt0120157","3207","7","A planet gets totalled."
"4378","tt0120157","3207","8","The end."
"4379","tt0120157","3207","9","Unless the Academy start a new category for ""Best Explosion"", Soldier is not going to win any awards."
"4380","tt0120157","3207","10","However, as ludicrous as it is, it remains an enjoyable experience."
"4381","tt0120157","3207","11","The military hardware is the coolest since Aliens the APC's especially and, at 90 minutes long, it doesn't outstay its welcome."
"4382","tt0120157","3207","12","Please note that the below mark is only a guide."
"4383","tt0120157","3207","13","Knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you don't like miniguns.7 out of 10"
"4384","tt0120157","3208","1","I have to say I quite enjoyed Soldier."
"4385","tt0120157","3208","2","Russell was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity."
"4386","tt0120157","3208","3","Very watchable and nowhere near as bad as I'd been led to believe."
"4387","tt0120157","3208","4","Yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment."
"4388","tt0120157","3209","1","Interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to."
"4389","tt0120157","3209","2","However, i'll try."
"4390","tt0120157","3209","3","This was a very good action film with some great set pieces."
"4391","tt0120157","3209","4","You'll note I specified the genre."
"4392","tt0120157","3209","5","I didn't snipe about the lack of characterisation, and I didn't berate the acting."
"4393","tt0120157","3209","6","Enjoy if for what it is people, a well above average action film."
"4394","tt0120157","3209","7","I could go on but I've made my comment."
"4395","tt0120157","3210","1","SOLDIER is not as bad as many have made it out to be."
"4396","tt0120157","3210","2","I found the film to have some of the sacarstic, cynical humour like that in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers."
"4397","tt0120157","3210","3","The lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic book atmosphere."
"4398","tt0120157","3210","4","One particular trivia bit stands out for me Todd has the names of several space war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE."
"4399","tt0120157","3210","5","For the oblivious ones out there, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in Roy Batty's elegiac last lines in Blade Runner."
"4400","tt0120157","3210","6","To imagine that Todd could have fought alongside android troops like Roy is mind boggling to say the least."
"4401","tt0120157","3210","7","Maybe script writer David Peoples was nostalgic."
"4402","tt0120157","3210","8","I'll give this one 3 out of 5."
"4403","tt0120157","3211","1","this movie is ok if you like mindless action ,corny acting, and a very small plot !"
"4404","tt0120157","3211","2","The special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of""Event Horizon""."
"4405","tt0120157","3211","3","The costumes are like something from a mad max movie ."
"4406","tt0120157","3211","4","None of the soldiers talk ,so others tell them what to do."
"4407","tt0120157","3211","5","It eventually end up as a big shoot'em up movie with explosions all the place."
"4408","tt0120157","3211","6","I personally liked Russell better in ""tango and cash""""escape from la/new york"" and ""executive decision""."
"4409","tt0120157","3211","7","It must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie!!"
"4410","tt0120157","3212","1","I've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasn't as successful commercially or artistically as it should have been, and discovered considerable artistic merit which may ultimately have been its commercial undoing."
"4411","tt0120157","3212","2","First of all, this movie attempts ""serious"" science fiction, social commentary, more than action adventure."
"4412","tt0120157","3212","3","There is action in it, but that's not really what it's about."
"4413","tt0120157","3212","4","If you focus on that, you'll end up with as others have noted a bad ""Aliens"" clone."
"4414","tt0120157","3212","5","But, again, that's not what it's about."
"4415","tt0120157","3212","6","The movie is really about Todd's Kurt Russell transformation from human to near machine and back to human mostly back."
"4416","tt0120157","3212","7","But because it's not trying to give you a typically glib Hollywood style answer, Kurt Russell must make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions."
"4417","tt0120157","3212","8","And he really does a wonderful job it can take two viewings to appreciate it."
"4418","tt0120157","3212","9","The surrounding ""social logic"" is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether Todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human ness or what, but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for Russell's easy to underestimate talent."
"4419","tt0120157","3213","1","What a perfect example of ""Less Is More..."""
"4420","tt0120157","3213","2","Kurt Russell Sgt."
"4421","tt0120157","3213","3","Todd only has 72 lines, and something like 104 words."
"4422","tt0120157","3213","4","What a challenge!"
"4423","tt0120157","3213","5","Like a black and white photo, when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks, the facial expressions, the physical drama, the emotive gesture, all combines to make a stronger impact."
"4424","tt0120157","3213","6","This is one of those top 5 movies I can't live without, right up there with the classics like Road Warrior."
"4425","tt0120157","3213","7","If you liked this, check out ""Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior"" and ""Braveheart"" both starring Mel Gibson."
"4426","tt0120157","3213","8","Also ""Gladiator"" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was in Soldier also."
"4427","tt0120157","3213","9","The ""Thirteenth Warrior"" starring Antonio Banderas and ""Blade Runner"" starring Harrison Ford."
"4428","tt0120157","3214","1","I fell in love with this silent action drama."
"4429","tt0120157","3214","2","Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played this so well."
"4430","tt0120157","3214","3","Raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting, Todd Kurt Russell is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers."
"4431","tt0120157","3214","4","The stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born SOLDIER."
"4432","tt0120157","3214","5","Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham Kurt Russell owns this role and made it entirely his original, daring, and all too human."
"4433","tt0120157","3214","6","I miss the fact that sequels were never made.10/10 LD_________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/"
"4434","tt0120157","3215","1","This was excellent."
"4435","tt0120157","3215","2","Touching, action packed, and perfect for Kurt Russel."
"4436","tt0120157","3215","3","I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars."
"4437","tt0120157","3215","4","This movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering, and people who learn that there is a time for fighting, a need to defend."
"4438","tt0120157","3215","5","I cried, laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story."
"4439","tt0120157","3215","6","Good writing job for an action flick, and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid."
"4440","tt0120157","3215","7","The ending wasn't twisty, but it was still excellent."
"4441","tt0120157","3215","8","If you like escape from New York, or rooting for the underdog, this movie is for you."
"4442","tt0120157","3215","9","Not an undue amount of gore or violence, it was not difficult to watch in that respect."
"4443","tt0120157","3215","10","Something for everyone."
"4444","tt0120157","3216","1","Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable Kurt Russell gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Jason Isaacs, who has Todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants."
"4445","tt0120157","3216","2","Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise."
"4446","tt0120157","3216","3","Director Paul W.S."
"4447","tt0120157","3216","4","Anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout."
"4448","tt0120157","3216","5","Moreover, Anderson handles moving moments of humanity well Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant and stages the stirring action scenes with rip roaring gusto."
"4449","tt0120157","3216","6","Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of Todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions."
"4450","tt0120157","3216","7","Bang up supporting turns by Jason Scott Lee as brutish rival soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as the kindly Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as mute little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as crusty seasoned veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the jolly Johnny Pig, and Brenda Wehle as the sensible Mayor Hawkins."
"4451","tt0120157","3216","8","Better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might."
"4452","tt0120157","3216","9","David Tattersall's polished cinematography, Joel McNeely's rousing full bore orchestral score, and the first rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hybrid outing."
"1","tt0023775","5450","1","Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers."
"2","tt0023775","5450","2","She's a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a little crummy mining town."
"3","tt0023775","5450","3","He also sells her to men."
"4","tt0023775","5450","4","She escapes to New York and literally sleeps her way to the top."
"5","tt0023775","5450","5","Originally I had only seen the 71 minute version but it's pretty extreme for its time."
"6","tt0023775","5450","6","Nowadays it's pretty tame."
"7","tt0023775","5450","7","The movie moves very quickly and has tons of sexual innuendo some of it comes off as pretty silly but fun today."
"8","tt0023775","5450","8","It moves so quickly you can easily ignore that most of it could never happen even in 1933."
"9","tt0023775","5450","9","There's nothing classic or monumental about this it's just a quick, gleefully dirty little film that's lots of fun."
"10","tt0023775","5450","10","It only falls apart at the end with a little ""moral"" ending that the censors demanded."
"11","tt0023775","5450","11","It comes across as unbelievable and stupid I saw it in a theatre and the audience laughed at it one guy quite rightfully said ""No way"" I just saw the uncut 75 minute version which has a different, somewhat tragic and MUCH better ending."
"12","tt0023775","5450","12","This version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake!"
"13","tt0023775","5450","13","I believe this is the only one in release but be aware."
"14","tt0023775","5450","14","The acting is good Stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it WAY over the top."
"15","tt0023775","5450","15","She makes you believe that she enjoys being cruel and sleeping around."
"16","tt0023775","5450","16","There are also strong supporting performances from handsome Donald Cook and George Brent."
"17","tt0023775","5450","17","Also look for a pre stardom John Wayne in a hilarious bit as a meek and mild office worker!"
"18","tt0023775","5450","18","Fun, dirty and fast."
"19","tt0023775","5450","19","I give this a 9."
"20","tt0023775","5451","1","I'd love to give this movie a 10/10, but in its existing state I can only go to 8/10 tops."
"21","tt0023775","5451","2","The post Code editing read: destroying of this film warrants a 2 point demerit."
"22","tt0023775","5451","3","From my very limited knowledge of film history, Baby Face was apparently one of two movies that finally broke the camel's back and brought the full wrath and enforcement of the Production Code into play in 1934."
"23","tt0023775","5451","4","I don't know what the other movie was."
"24","tt0023775","5451","5","As a result, the movie in its original incarnation was never allowed to be re released after 1934."
"25","tt0023775","5451","6","It was chopped and edited to bits, and no original version is known to exist today."
"26","tt0023775","5451","7","The best that we can see today is the version that TCM Turner Classic Movies shows, but that is blatantly edited in several scenes, and has a really disappointing ""happy ending"" slapped onto the end."
"27","tt0023775","5451","8","All the above being said, the movie is still pretty darned great and lots of fun to watch."
"28","tt0023775","5451","9","Barbara Stanwyck is, as always, absolutely amazing and wonderful."
"29","tt0023775","5451","10","She is so beautiful and powerful; she just owns the whole movie!"
"30","tt0023775","5451","11","She plays a woman who's been used by men her entire life, starting with her father who pimps her out to the local Erie, PA steel workers as well as to local politicians in a quid pro quo of 'if you don't shut down my speakeasy I'll let you sleep with my daughter'."
"31","tt0023775","5451","12","When the father dies in a fiery explosion near the beginning of the flick, the smile on Stanwyck's face is priceless."
"32","tt0023775","5451","13","After the fire, Stanwyck leaves Erie with her maid and heads to New York City."
"33","tt0023775","5451","14","She sets her sights on a skyscraper and starts literally working her way to the top."
"34","tt0023775","5451","15","Starting out with the personnel clerk in the HR department, she sleeps with him to get an entry level position at the bank."
"35","tt0023775","5451","16","From there, she sleeps with man after man after man including a very young John Wayne using each new man to help her land a higher paying job on a higher floor of the skyscraper, with increasingly powerful male bosses cum sugar daddies."
"36","tt0023775","5451","17","Stanwyck stops at nothing in her rise to the top."
"37","tt0023775","5451","18","It is great fun to see her and her maid in increasingly fancier clothes and apartments as Stanwyck works her way up the corporate ladder."
"38","tt0023775","5451","19","Stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale, manipulating, she vixen in this flick!"
"39","tt0023775","5451","20","If you watch this movie, I recommend stopping when you see the George Brent character Courtland Trenholm die in Stanwyck's arms."
"40","tt0023775","5451","21","Skip the remaining 3 minutes or so!"
"41","tt0023775","5451","22","The ""happy ending"" slapped on to the end of the movie for post Code audiences is insulting to the audience's intelligence and lame beyond belief: the bank board members are sitting around a table expositing about Mr. and Mrs."
"42","tt0023775","5451","23","Trenholm's million dollar donation to the bank and how they are living happily but poor in Erie, with former VP Trenholm now working in the steel mills cut to the exact same footage of a steel plant that we saw in the beginning of the movie ""The End""."
"43","tt0023775","5451","24","PUH LEEZE HOW LAME!"
"44","tt0023775","5451","25","The movie originally ended with George Brent succeeding in his suicide attempt."
"45","tt0023775","5451","26","I think that ending fits the overall mood of the movie much better than the slapped on post Code ending."
"46","tt0023775","5451","27","I certainly hope that a print of the original pre Code version of this flick is discovered during my lifetime update: the original HAS been found and should be out on DVD and/or TCM in 2006!."
"47","tt0023775","5451","28","Until then, I'll enjoy the TCM version and switch it off before the lame o post Code ending."
"48","tt0023775","5452","1","A pre code stunner with Stanwyck playing a speakeasy whore who sleeps her way to the top."
"49","tt0023775","5452","2","These pre code flicks really let it all go with nothing left to the imagination."
"50","tt0023775","5452","3","Stanwyck is outstanding as Lilly the daughter of a speakeasy owner/father who sold more than booze to his patronsjohns."
"51","tt0023775","5452","4","After the old man diesgood!"
"52","tt0023775","5452","5","Barb heads for the big city for better things."
"53","tt0023775","5452","6","She uses her female attributes to sleep her way to the top."
"54","tt0023775","5452","7","John Wayne makes a poor ""cameo"" and proves that actors get better with age and an acting coach."
"55","tt0023775","5452","8","I loved the banter and strong lines between the actors."
"56","tt0023775","5452","9","I highly recommend this film to all film buffs and to watch Stanwyck who is great and beautiful as Lilly."
"57","tt0023775","5453","1","In ten words or less to describe this film, Barbara Stanwyck is too appealing and it is great!"
"58","tt0023775","5453","2","The film is wonderful, except for the perhaps tacked on ending, but I love happy endings anyway."
"59","tt0023775","5453","3","Barbara Stanwyck, however, as the platinum blonde gold digger is amazing."
"60","tt0023775","5453","4","She knows what she wants and goes after it!"
"61","tt0023775","5453","5","This film is sexy and excellent!"
"62","tt0023775","5454","1","This is one of the most daring and important of the so called ""Pre Code"" films made in Hollywood during the 1930s."
"63","tt0023775","5454","2","Unlike some Pre Code films that occasionally dabbled in subjects that would have never been allowed after 1934 5, this film fully immersed itself in a very sordid yet entertaining plot from start to finish."
"64","tt0023775","5454","3","The conventional morality of the late 30s and 40s was definitely NOT evident in this film, as the film is essentially about a conniving woman who sleeps her way to the top and with no apologies along the way."
"65","tt0023775","5454","4","This ""broad"" both enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich something you just never would have seen in films made just two or three years later."
"66","tt0023775","5454","5","The film begins with Barbara Stanwyck working in her father's speakeasy."
"67","tt0023775","5454","6","In addition to being her boss, he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he'll allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity."
"68","tt0023775","5454","7","While not especially clear here, it appears as if Daddy has been ""renting"" his daughter's body out for a long time."
"69","tt0023775","5454","8","However, after nearly being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer over his skull, Barbara has had enough and heads to the big city."
"70","tt0023775","5454","9","It doesn't hurt that the still blew up and killed her father, but her feeling that she was whoring herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the impetus to move."
"71","tt0023775","5454","10","Despite the Depression, Barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega bank."
"72","tt0023775","5454","11","She starts out at a pretty menial job as a file clerk, but in the space of what seems like just a few weeks, she sleeps her way from one job to another to yet another until she is sleeping with the head of the bank and his future son in law!!!"
"73","tt0023775","5454","12","This all ends in tragedy, but Babs doesn't seem too shook up over the deaths of these two men."
"74","tt0023775","5454","13","In fact, some time later, she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the NEW CEO and once again she's on top perhaps in more way than one."
"75","tt0023775","5454","14","Now so far, this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and unrepentant."
"76","tt0023775","5454","15","Barbara played a 100% sociopath a woman with no morality and no conscience just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could no matter who she hurt in the process."
"77","tt0023775","5454","16","However, the brave writers and producer ""chickened out"" and thought it important to tack on a redemptive ending."
"78","tt0023775","5454","17","Considering that this woman was so evil and conniving, her change of heart at the end was a major disappointment and strongly detracted from the film."
"79","tt0023775","5454","18","In many ways, this reminded me of the ending of JEZEBEL as once again, a wicked person somehow ""sees the light"" and changes at the not too convincing conclusion."
"80","tt0023775","5454","19","My advice is to try watching RED HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS."
"81","tt0023775","5454","20","RED HEADED WOMAN is much like BABY FACE but features no magical transformation at the end the leading lady really is a skunk down deep!"
"82","tt0023775","5454","21","In DOWNSTAIRS, a film very much like RED HEADED WOMAN, the roles are reversed and a man John Gilbert plays a similar conniving character."
"83","tt0023775","5454","22","Both are classics and a bit better than this film."
"84","tt0023775","5454","23","This film is an amazing curio of a brief period of often ultra sleazy Hollywood films and in this light it's well worth seeing for Cinephiles."
"85","tt0023775","5454","24","Also, fans of The Duke take note John Wayne plays a very small part in the film and it's very unusual to see a very young Wayne playing such a conventional role."
"86","tt0023775","5455","1","Infamous pre code film, really the one film that caused people to insist on the Hayes Code being strictly enforced."
"87","tt0023775","5455","2","Barbara Stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor selling father has no problem pimping her out to customers."
"88","tt0023775","5455","3","When he dies in an accident, she's released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants."
"89","tt0023775","5455","4","She goes to New York and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder, one bed at a time."
"90","tt0023775","5455","5","Although obviously there's no actual sex shown, the film is quite sleazy."
"91","tt0023775","5455","6","Unfortunately, after the initial shock value fades around the time Stanwyck screws a rail car inspector so she can travel for free, the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull."
"92","tt0023775","5455","7","Stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through."
"93","tt0023775","5455","8","As always, she's fantastic."
"94","tt0023775","5456","1","Director Alfred Green's melodrama ""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck ranks as one of the more notorious of the Pre Code movies."
"95","tt0023775","5456","2","These films were produced before the Production Code Administration had the power to enforce its rules in 1934."
"96","tt0023775","5456","3","""Inspiration"" scenarist Gene Markey and ""Midnight Mary"" scribe Kathryn Scola penned the screenplay, based on Mark Canfield's story, about the rise and fall of a girl who used her sexual charms to acquire wealth and position in society."
"97","tt0023775","5456","4","Incidentally, Mark Canfield was a pseudonym for producer Daryl F."
"98","tt0023775","5456","5","Zanuck."
"99","tt0023775","5456","6","These Pre Code films today seem tame, but they aroused controversy galore and contained more racy material than most movies until the late 1950s when the Code began to erode."
"100","tt0023775","5456","7","The themes that the filmmakers explore are women versus men, women versus women, and women versus society."
"101","tt0023775","5456","8","Our crafty protagonist does enough skulduggery that all themes are about equal."
"102","tt0023775","5456","9","Lily's worthless father Nick Powers Robert Barret of ""Distant Drums"" operates an illegal speakeasy bar during Prohibition, when the Thirteen Amendment outlawed liquor, and brews his own booze in a still out back."
"103","tt0023775","5456","10","Nick is such as an obnoxious fellow that he pimps out her beautiful, but hard working daughter Lily Barbara Stanwyck of ""Night Nurse"", but Lily refuses to help her father out with a sleazy local politician."
"104","tt0023775","5456","11","The politician."
"105","tt0023775","5456","12","Ed Sipple Arthur Hohl of ""Private Detective 62"" vows to retaliate for Lily's refusal to accommodate him."
"106","tt0023775","5456","13","Later, Nick chews his rebellious daughter out."
"107","tt0023775","5456","14","Lily reproaches him."
"108","tt0023775","5456","15","""Yeah, I'm a tramp and who's to blame."
"109","tt0023775","5456","16","My father, a swell start you gave me, nothing but men, dirty, rotten men."
"110","tt0023775","5456","17","And you're lower than any of them."""
"111","tt0023775","5456","18","No sooner has she stormed off than Nick dies when his still blows up and kills him."
"112","tt0023775","5456","19","Lily and her African American maid Chico Theresa Harris of ""Arrowsmith"" pack their bags and catch a ride of the first freight leaving town."
"113","tt0023775","5456","20","No sooner have our heroines arrived in New York than Lily uses her charm to get a job in a bank."
"114","tt0023775","5456","21","Visually, director Green shows Lily's shrewd ascension up the ladder with camera angles that move upward until Lily's sexuality threatens to destroy the bank."
"115","tt0023775","5456","22","At one point, Lily breaks up a marriage between one bank officer, Ned Stevens Donald Cook of ""The Public Enemy"" and his fiancée, Anne Carter Margaret Lindsay of ""Cavalcade"" after Stevens had almost fired her for flirting with her boss, Brody Douglas Dumbrille of ""His Women"" in the employee restroom."
"116","tt0023775","5456","23","Lily is extremely shrewd and manages to emerge from each debacle better off than before."
"117","tt0023775","5456","24","The board of trustees hires Courtland Trenholm George Bent of ""Jezebel"" to take over as president of the bank."
"118","tt0023775","5456","25","The first thing that Trenholm does is pay off Lily instead of letting her publish her diary entries about the higher ups at the bank."
"119","tt0023775","5456","26","Moreover, Trenholm ships Lily off to their branch bank in Paris where Lily doesn't create any commotion until Trenholm arrives and they become romantically attached."
"120","tt0023775","5456","27","Lily fights tooth and nail for everything that she has gotten and hates to throw it all away, but she sacrifices everything at the end for her husband."
"121","tt0023775","5456","28","Ironically, Lily winds up back in the same town that she started out in, but Trenholm and she are happy now."
"122","tt0023775","5456","29","""Baby Face"" qualifies as one of the five best Pre Code movies."
"123","tt0023775","5456","30","Look for John Wayne dressed up in a suit and tie in one scene."
"124","tt0023775","5457","1","This film is one of the more risqué black and white films of this time in the early 1930's before the Hoyts Code was enforced."
"125","tt0023775","5457","2","It's the story of a young beautiful woman moving to New York and making her way to the top of the business by using her body as a tool to get there."
"126","tt0023775","5457","3","Barbara Stanwyck plays the young and beautiful Lily Powers who indeed does a fairly well job with her performance."
"127","tt0023775","5457","4","Lily moves to New York and makes her way up the business place by sleeping with all the men."
"128","tt0023775","5457","5","Stanwyck does an outstanding performance as being a strong woman who uses men as one time deals, hardly any emotion towards them playing them as if they were pawns."
"129","tt0023775","5457","6","Lily Powers is a woman who doesn't have love on her mind just power and money."
"130","tt0023775","5457","7","I thought this movie to be a little bit different then other films I have seen because there is hardly any background music heard."
"131","tt0023775","5457","8","I believe it is only because this is when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the film."
"132","tt0023775","5457","9","The few times the music is heard is during the beginning as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain."
"133","tt0023775","5457","10","The filming and different scenes were something fantastic!"
"134","tt0023775","5457","11","The director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this film full of realism."
"135","tt0023775","5457","12","This film was all together an alright movie."
"136","tt0023775","5457","13","The ending to this movie wasn't as good as it should have been, but it didn't entirely ruin it."
"137","tt0023775","5457","14","Baby Face had its slow moving scenes throughout the movie, and perhaps a few predictable parts such as who she will sleep with next."
"138","tt0023775","5457","15","But this is a lovable movie that can be watched more then once, and suggested to some people and friends."
"139","tt0023775","5458","1","I enjoyed this movie a lot."
"140","tt0023775","5458","2","I thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in American history."
"141","tt0023775","5458","3","There is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system."
"142","tt0023775","5458","4","I feel that the character of Lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better."
"143","tt0023775","5458","5","What I enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was."
"144","tt0023775","5458","6","Throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her, had given her everything, even lost their careers for her."
"145","tt0023775","5458","7","Until she had met Cortland, she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness."
"146","tt0023775","5458","8","The way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible."
"147","tt0023775","5458","9","I'd recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the under laying meaning of the movie and plot."
"148","tt0023775","5459","1","BABY FACE is a fast paced, wise cracking, knowing smirk of a film thatlasts only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh what a smart 75 minutes theyare!"
"149","tt0023775","5459","2","That a story that covers so much ground could be told in such ashort time puts most of today's movie makers to shame."
"150","tt0023775","5459","3","Screenwriters oftoday should study the economy of BABY FACE and cut the bloat thatoverwhelms so many of their films."
"151","tt0023775","5459","4","The story is no nonsense."
"152","tt0023775","5459","5","An amoral woman rises to wealth first under,and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her."
"153","tt0023775","5459","6","Sure the production code loused it up with a redeeming, happy ending,but it isn't hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted togo, so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest."
"154","tt0023775","5459","7","Stanwyck is terrific as is George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as ahapless suitor."
"155","tt0023775","5459","8","Not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one."
"156","tt0023775","5459","9","Ifyou've never seen BABY FACE catch it the next time it's shown on cableor rent the cassette."
"157","tt0023775","5459","10","It's worth the effort.."
"158","tt0023775","5460","1","Lily Powers works at a speakeasy until her father dies."
"159","tt0023775","5460","2","She then goes to New York to work at an office building."
"160","tt0023775","5460","3","There she notices that if she wants to get any higher she has to give the men what they want."
"161","tt0023775","5460","4","And what men want is her...well, you know."
"162","tt0023775","5460","5","Alfred E.Green's Baby Face 1933 is a movie of high sexual content."
"163","tt0023775","5460","6","For a movie of that era, anyway."
"164","tt0023775","5460","7","This was one of the last Pre Code films that were made."
"165","tt0023775","5460","8","Barbara Stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as Lily."
"166","tt0023775","5460","9","Other actors of this film include George Brent Courtland Trenholm, Donald Cook Ned Stevens, Alphonse Ethier Adolf Cragg, Henry Kolker J.P.Carter, Margaret Lindsay Ann Carter and Theresa Harris Chico."
"167","tt0023775","5460","10","The young John Wayne is seen as Jimmy McCoy Jr."
"168","tt0023775","5460","11","This movie deals with a brave topic and it does it good."
"169","tt0023775","5460","12","Baby Face is historically significant movie and therefore good to watch."
"170","tt0023775","5461","1","Escaping the life of being pimped by her father..and the speakeasy waitressingwho dies in an explosion, Lily PowersBarbara Stanwyck, who is simply ravishingsluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city Gotham."
"171","tt0023775","5461","2","When a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father in lawand Lily's new lover, the sky's the limit for Lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesn't come into her hands."
"172","tt0023775","5461","3","Newly appointed president to the bank, Courtland TrenholmGeorge Brent, sends Lily to Paris instead of forking over lots of dough, but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the City of Love."
"173","tt0023775","5461","4","This makes Lily's mouth water as now she'll have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way."
"174","tt0023775","5461","5","Though, circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches.."
"175","tt0023775","5461","6","Trenholm, now her husband, is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank."
"176","tt0023775","5461","7","He needs money Lily now has in her possession or he'll have absolutely nothing."
"177","tt0023775","5461","8","Stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual Warner Brothers polish."
"178","tt0023775","5461","9","Being set in the pre code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy."
"179","tt0023775","5461","10","Good direction from Alfred E Green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of Stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act."
"180","tt0023775","5461","11","Obviously the film shows that money isn't everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of Lily's dead heart."
"181","tt0023775","5461","12","That ending having Lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love didn't ring true to me."
"182","tt0023775","5461","13","She's spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him."
"183","tt0023775","5462","1","First off, if you're planning on watching this, make sure to watch the UNCUT version although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were tampered with due to censorship, it makes a HUGE difference."
"184","tt0023775","5462","2","This film is about a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father."
"185","tt0023775","5462","3","When her father suddenly passes away, she is able to go out into the world on her own."
"186","tt0023775","5462","4","After reading about Nietzsche's philosophies on life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love."
"187","tt0023775","5462","5","Throughout the movie she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all."
"188","tt0023775","5462","6","Overall, Baby Face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film."
"189","tt0023775","5462","7","While no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen, it is very obvious what is happening off camera."
"190","tt0023775","5462","8","I enjoyed watching this film very much and I believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it, especially with the films shock value."
"191","tt0023775","5462","9","I did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts, but I think that about most movies the first time is see them."
"192","tt0023775","5462","10","Actually, I think that almost all movies I've seen made from the early 30's had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just didn't quite ""flow"" right."
"193","tt0023775","5462","11","This was probably just the craft of film making wasn't quite perfected yet  it would take just a few more years."
"194","tt0023775","5462","12","Compare a film from 1939 and compare it with an early 30's film and I think you'll see what I mean."
"195","tt0023775","5462","13","Once again, I'm very glad I was able to watch the original cut; it really does make a big difference."
"196","tt0023775","5462","14","Also any John Wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role."
"197","tt0023775","5463","1","Very slick, very Pre Hays Code, and still very sassy."
"198","tt0023775","5463","2","I would highly recommend seeing this movie, even if you are not a fan of Stynwyck."
"199","tt0023775","5463","3","She's funny, she's sexy, she's hard working and love that perm she gets!"
"200","tt0023775","5463","4","Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a doozie of a floozy who rises up in the world, perfectly portrayed by a bank building."
"201","tt0023775","5463","5","John Wayne in a suit!"
"202","tt0023775","5463","6","plays one of her first conquests."
"203","tt0023775","5463","7","The last three minutes are a letdown, but the sets, the lines, the clothes all add to one heck of a movie about rising vertically in the horizontal position."
"204","tt0023775","5464","1","Babyface Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power he tries to get her to read Nietzche she says books ain't never done her no good."
"205","tt0023775","5464","2","Soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others."
"206","tt0023775","5464","3","Finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city."
"207","tt0023775","5464","4","We follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank."
"208","tt0023775","5464","5","The dialogue is quite saucy for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted Hollywood production code."
"209","tt0023775","5464","6","Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims."
"210","tt0023775","5464","7","Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collection I watched the extended version the DVD has both versions plus Red Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge."
"211","tt0023775","5464","8","An interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir."
"212","tt0023775","5464","9","B+"
"213","tt0023775","5465","1","This is a hard boiled Warner Brothers film starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck."
"214","tt0023775","5465","2","A consummate master at portraying Machiavellian cool, a technique she perfected eleven years later in Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"", Stanwyck plays Lily Powers, the well worn daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a suffocating steel town."
"215","tt0023775","5465","3","She has been rendered cynical and numb by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her father's customers."
"216","tt0023775","5465","4","Once her father dies in a distillery explosion, she hops a freight train to New York and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder of a bank."
"217","tt0023775","5465","5","This would come across as preposterous were it not for Stanwyck's blazing work here."
"218","tt0023775","5465","6","With her dead eyed stare and amoral seduction methods, it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive carnality."
"219","tt0023775","5465","7","One of the young men she seduces along the way is a fresh faced John Wayne as of all things, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy."
"220","tt0023775","5465","8","The melodrama gets heavy handed toward the last third of the film with a murder suicide, a hush hush job in Paris to keep Lily quiet and the new bank president who is so addicted to Lily that he embezzles company funds to keep her in luxury."
"221","tt0023775","5465","9","A tacked on ending is somewhat disappointing but not before Stanwyck sears the screen."
"222","tt0023775","5465","10","The film has curious touches like Lily's bonding friendship with an African American woman named Chico and the German immigrant who teaches Lily about Nietzsche philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality."
"223","tt0023775","5466","1","Excellent, pre code amoral tale with Barbara Stanwyck as the newly inspired by writings of Nietzsche!"
"224","tt0023775","5466","2","to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself, use men to her advantage."
"225","tt0023775","5466","3","Not really fair on the German philosopher but interesting that this was the year Hitler came to power."
"226","tt0023775","5466","4","Stanwyck, even in this young version doesn't do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here, ever driving herself and the film forward."
"227","tt0023775","5466","5","Not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risqué situations and astonishing quips and innuendo."
"228","tt0023775","5466","6","Great fun, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and I suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female."
"229","tt0023775","5466","7","Still, that's life!"
"230","tt0023775","5467","1","In my opinion this has to be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best performances."
"231","tt0023775","5467","2","She was one of only a handful of actors, then and now, who could say more with a single look than an entire page of dialogue."
"232","tt0023775","5467","3","And I was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored movie, with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage."
"233","tt0023775","5467","4","Too bad the movie is so short."
"234","tt0023775","5467","5","Lily is a young woman barely holding it together working for her father in his illegal speakeasy."
"235","tt0023775","5467","6","Her only link to anything is her good friend, Chico, played wonderfully by Theresa Harris."
"236","tt0023775","5467","7","Though Chico is African American and having a white woman be best friends with a black woman back in the 30s was as controversial as the subject matter of this movie, and Lily is not, they have a special bond."
"237","tt0023775","5467","8","And it is not sexual."
"238","tt0023775","5467","9","Just 2 women stuck, or shoved, into a situation beyond their control."
"239","tt0023775","5467","10","After Lily's father dies, and she does not know what she will do, she is told that she has the power to get out and to get what she wants."
"240","tt0023775","5467","11","Yes, it's immoral, but that's the entire point of this movie."
"241","tt0023775","5467","12","Then ""they"" had to go and ruin the last few minutes."
"242","tt0023775","5467","13","So, up until the last few minutes of the movie, it's a superb film and worth watching."
"243","tt0023775","5467","14","The ""lesson"" of the movie is still as valid today as it was back then, and I'm sure will be a 100 years from now."
"244","tt0023775","5467","15","Women, it's awful what Lily does in order to get what she wants, but it works."
"245","tt0023775","5467","16","Men, take note."
"246","tt0023775","5468","1","I hand't seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of ""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM."
"247","tt0023775","5468","2","What a great movie!"
"248","tt0023775","5468","3","In a nutshell Lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pimped out by her own Father since she was 14!"
"249","tt0023775","5468","4","Then his still blows up and he's killed leaving Lily Stanwyck alone cept for her black maid Chico, played very nicely by Theresa Harris."
"250","tt0023775","5468","5","Lily leaves for the big city New York deciding to use her sex to get to the top."
"251","tt0023775","5468","6","She does this in great style!"
"252","tt0023775","5468","7","She seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy!"
"253","tt0023775","5468","8","One dumps his fiancée and kills his near father in law, also Lily's sugar daddy, then commits suicide!"
"254","tt0023775","5468","9","Lily barely blinks!"
"255","tt0023775","5468","10","STanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn't know what love is."
"256","tt0023775","5468","11","Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when he's in deep financial straights, she bolts."
"257","tt0023775","5468","12","Nearly free with Chico and a half million, she realizes she loved Court!"
"258","tt0023775","5468","13","Lily races to find him, but will she be too late."
"259","tt0023775","5468","14","This is pre code Hollywood at its best."
"260","tt0023775","5468","15","Stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect."
"261","tt0023775","5468","16","This reminded me of ""Original Sin"" with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman, those who disliked that films ultra romantic leanings, will not like Baby FAce any better, those with belief in sex, love and power, will love it."
"262","tt0023775","5468","17","Highly recommended!"
"263","tt0023775","5468","18","See it!"
"264","tt0023775","5469","1","The pre release version of 1933's ""Baby Face"" would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment."
"265","tt0023775","5469","2","Mentored by a Nietszchean professor, Lily Powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father's speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank."
"266","tt0023775","5469","3","Because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault, the film has no victims, except Lily's childhood, which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father."
"267","tt0023775","5469","4","The destructive relationship with her father suggests Lily's hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate."
"268","tt0023775","5469","5","While Lily is cynical and obvious in her approach, the men she targets willingly betray wives and fiancés to trade jobs for sexual favors."
"269","tt0023775","5469","6","Perhaps the bank failures in the 1930's owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women."
"270","tt0023775","5469","7","The plot moves fast, and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the façade of the office building as Lily climbs ever higher."
"271","tt0023775","5469","8","Barbara Stanwyck reveled in tough hard bitten roles, and she is in top form here."
"272","tt0023775","5469","9","Sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung."
"273","tt0023775","5469","10","Only her African American confidante, Chico, receives Lily's affection, trust, and loyalty."
"274","tt0023775","5469","11","In more enlightened times, the fresh natural beauty of Theresa Harris, who plays Chico, would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her."
"275","tt0023775","5469","12","Stanwyck often appears overly made up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to Harris."
"276","tt0023775","5469","13","However, despite Stanwyck's tough demeanor, obvious tactics, and artificial visage, she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men, including Douglass Dumbrille, Donald Cook, and a young John Wayne."
"277","tt0023775","5469","14","The preferred version of ""Baby Face"" is the 76 minute restored cut."
"278","tt0023775","5469","15","The edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts, which the longer cut restores and makes explicit."
"279","tt0023775","5469","16","Perhaps Darryl Zanuck, who wrote the story under an assumed name, intended a lesson by quoting from Nietszche, whose views on women were controversial."
"280","tt0023775","5469","17","However, despite Alphonse Ethier's lectures and advice not to be defeated by life, Lily's grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor."
"281","tt0023775","5469","18","However, the philosophy is but a distraction."
"282","tt0023775","5469","19","Short, fast paced, and entertaining, ""Baby Face"" is as contemporary in its morality as ""Wall Street."""
"283","tt0023775","5469","20","Substitute Gordon Gecko for Nietszche, and Lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be ""greed is good."""
"284","tt0023775","5470","1","BABY FACE is one of the better of the ""forgotten"" films before the code."
"285","tt0023775","5470","2","It was shown last night after the 1931 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE on the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK, so I was able to watch the film as it is now with four plus minutes of it restored."
"286","tt0023775","5470","3","Stanwyck is living in East St."
"287","tt0023775","5470","4","Louis where she may have known the drunken parents of ""Myra"" Mae Clarke in WATERLOO BRIDGE."
"288","tt0023775","5470","5","Her father is Robert Barrett."
"289","tt0023775","5470","6","She has lived with him since the death of her mother, and in the restored dialog he has been pimping her since she was 14 years old."
"290","tt0023775","5470","7","Now she is resident waitress and part time whore in his speakeasy, her closest friend being Chico Theresa Harris, the African American servant who Barrett keeps bullying."
"291","tt0023775","5470","8","It is one of the two good points of Stanwyck's personality that she keeps standing up to her father about Harris, threatening to leave if Harris is fired and since it is the grubby workers like Nat Pendleton, who enjoy seeing Stanwyck serve them, rather than the flavor of the hooch he serves that brings them in, Barrett has to obey her."
"292","tt0023775","5470","9","The one guy who comes to the speakeasy regularly whom Stanwyck likes is the shoemaker and intellectual Adolf Cragg Alphonse Ethier, who sees great potential in the spirited girl if she will just leave her forsaken home."
"293","tt0023775","5470","10","He is also pushing the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche, and the idea of the will to power."
"294","tt0023775","5470","11","More about this later."
"295","tt0023775","5470","12","After she knocks out the local political bigwig Arthur Hohl, and has an argument with Barrett about this, a still explosion kills Barrett, and enables Stanwyck to leave her home town."
"296","tt0023775","5470","13","She and Harris head to New York City, managing to get free transport by a railroad freight car by sleeping with a brakeman James Murray."
"297","tt0023775","5470","14","They reach New York, and after walking about they see the Gotham Trust Company established 1873, and the friendly guard tells her where the personnel office is."
"298","tt0023775","5470","15","We slowly watch Stanwyck ascend the corporate ladder to the top, similar but sleazier than Robert Morse dared in HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING."
"299","tt0023775","5470","16","But Morse was a man in a man dominated company."
"300","tt0023775","5470","17","Stanwyck knows her sexual allure is her weapon."
"301","tt0023775","5470","18","She goes through John Wayne, Douglas Dumbrille a section of the film that I always felt was the most shocking curiously enough when I watched it, Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker, and finally George Brent."
"302","tt0023775","5470","19","Each ends up falling for her, and either being pushed aside when no longer useful, or destroyed by her."
"303","tt0023775","5470","20","Brent, the new President of the Bank his grandfather founded, eventually marries her and the crisis of the film is when the bank's economic situation is shaken especially after Brent buys her a fortune in jewels and gives her valuable bonds."
"304","tt0023775","5470","21","Brent is indicted."
"305","tt0023775","5470","22","Will she stick up for him."
"306","tt0023775","5470","23","SPOILER COMING UP: The one thing about these films that is not admitted is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictated endings."
"307","tt0023775","5470","24","The original ending had Stanwyck boarding a ship for Europe abandoning Brent to his fate, but realizing she can't do it to him, returning to their apartment house, and finding he's shot himself."
"308","tt0023775","5470","25","She is riding with him to the hospital as it ends."
"309","tt0023775","5470","26","Now before the rediscovered footage was found, the film ended with them apparently giving up all their money to the bank to save it, and retiring back to East St."
"310","tt0023775","5470","27","Louis, to live happily if poor."
"311","tt0023775","5470","28","Neither of these are good endings."
"312","tt0023775","5470","29","Stanwyck should continue on her destructive course, with Brent the last of her victims."
"313","tt0023775","5470","30","But even without the Breen office the script writers one is Darryl Zanuck, by the way saw fit to have her find a moral center."
"314","tt0023775","5470","31","She has none at least none for powerful men whom she hates."
"315","tt0023775","5470","32","I don't think that a depression audience would have tolerated that type of conclusion."
"316","tt0023775","5470","33","There are other problems, due to the changing styles of public opinion and changes in society."
"317","tt0023775","5470","34","It was a man's world in the corporate world in 1933, so Stanwyck has her work cut out for her."
"318","tt0023775","5470","35","Wood when she is going to be fired for an indiscretion with him admits that he did not want her to work."
"319","tt0023775","5470","36","But in 2006, Stanwyck would have been finding woman all over the place."
"320","tt0023775","5470","37","In the film there are nasty, catty remarks obviously some based on jealousy towards Stanwyck from other secretaries and female employees at her rapid rise."
"321","tt0023775","5470","38","In 2006, she'd be frequently confronting women superiors, and she would find them cutting her off at the legs very quickly."
"322","tt0023775","5470","39","Of course, if she finds one or two are lesbians she might try that road but it is doubtful."
"323","tt0023775","5470","40","And she also never seems to meet any men who are gay."
"324","tt0023775","5470","41","They do have gay male executives in business, who wouldn't give a damn about her legs or breasts."
"325","tt0023775","5470","42","Then there is her mentor, Mr Cragg."
"326","tt0023775","5470","43","Cragg is remade in the ""bowdlerized"" version into trying to make her seek a moral center."
"327","tt0023775","5470","44","In reality he pushes Nieztsche, but the way in a broader sense the Nazis pushed Nieztsche find your way to power and push it."
"328","tt0023775","5470","45","While Nieztsche did stress power sometimes, it wasn't the be all and end all of his theories."
"329","tt0023775","5470","46","Otherwise nobody would read him today in college courses."
"330","tt0023775","5470","47","Cragg is obviously self educated, but only half educated."
"331","tt0023775","5470","48","In short if somebody who thoroughly studied Nieztsche confronted Cragg he'd make him look like a half educated fool."
"332","tt0023775","5470","49","And this is Stanwyck's mentor!"
"333","tt0023775","5470","50","A good film, and for it's day worth a 10...but seriously flawed."
"334","tt0023775","5471","1","During 1933 this film had many cuts taken from it because it was very over the top for the story content and the fact that Lily Powers,Barbara Stanwyck would do anything to obtain great wealth and power."
"335","tt0023775","5471","2","Lily's father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on Lily."
"336","tt0023775","5471","3","As the story progresses, Lily meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president It is great to see a very young John Wayne, Jimmy McCoy Jr. who was only 25 when this picture was produced and Jimmy did not even get to first base with Lily, not even for lunch."
"337","tt0023775","5471","4","A very young George Brent, Coutland Trenholm stars along with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances."
"338","tt0023775","5471","5","This is a great film from 1933 which was produced by Darryl F."
"339","tt0023775","5471","6","Zanuck and was locked up in a fault for many years and just recently is being shown on the silver screen."
"340","tt0023775","5471","7","This film is rather mild compared to what we view on the Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of film."
"341","tt0023775","5471","8","Enjoy"
"342","tt0023775","5472","1","Barbara Stanwyck as a real tough cookie, a waitress to the working classes and prostitute at the hands of her father who escapes to New York City and uses her feminine wiles to get a filing job, moving on to Mortgage and Escrow, and later as assistant secretary to the second in command at the bank."
"343","tt0023775","5472","2","Dramatic study of a female character unafraid to be unseemly has lost none of its power over the years, with Barbara acting up a storm portraying a woman who learns to be a first rate actress herself."
"344","tt0023775","5472","3","Parlaying a little Nietzschean philosophy into her messed up life, this lady crushes out sentiment all right, but she never loses our fascination, our awe."
"345","tt0023775","5472","4","She's a plain spoken, hard boiled broad, but she's not a bitch, nor is she a man eater or woman hater."
"346","tt0023775","5472","5","This gal is all out for herself, and as we wait for her to eventually learn about real values in life, her journey up and down the ladder of success provides heated, sexy entertainment."
"347","tt0023775","5472","6","John Wayne with thick black hair and too much eye make up does well in an early role as the assistant in the file office, though all the supporting players are quite good.  from"
"348","tt0023775","5473","1","This one is considered a key Pre Code film  from the director who later made the musical biopic THE JOLSON STORY 1946, but also the paranoid sci fi INVASION U.S.A."
"349","tt0023775","5473","2","1952!"
"350","tt0023775","5473","3"," and features one of Barbara Stanwyck's best early roles."
"351","tt0023775","5473","4","She's supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day  George Brent, Douglass Dumbrille, Edward van Sloan, Nat Pendleton and John Wayne at one point addressing Stanwyck with the titular nickname, derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout in the former category and, in the latter, Robert Barrat as Stanwyck's father, Donald Cook as her most tragic conquest, Alphonse Ethier as her elderly mentor  more on this later, Arthur Hohl as a lecherous politician and Henry Kolker as Cook's boss and father in law, whom Stanwyck also seduces."
"352","tt0023775","5473","5","Curiously, scenes in which Walter Brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors!"
"353","tt0023775","5473","6","Abetted by crackling i.e. typically hard boiled dialogue and realistic Anton Grot sets, the narrative contains unexpected overtones of Nietzschean philosophy fed to our small town heroine by the intellectual Ethier Stanwyck complains to him early on that she's no ""ball of fire"" which, of course, contradicts her later comedy  directed by Howard Hawks and co starring Gary Cooper  of that name!."
"354","tt0023775","5473","7","Under Ethier's auspices, she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success; the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the New York firm she's eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one  relating to an ambitious statesman's lust for power  in Sergei Eisenstein's October 1927!"
"355","tt0023775","5473","8","Sociologically, it's also interesting that Stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid/companion."
"356","tt0023775","5473","9","The first two thirds of the film are simply terrific; at first, I found the latter stages somewhat disappointing  because I was expecting to see Stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly introduced George Brent character while he ignores her but, just like the others, he's soon under her spell!"
"357","tt0023775","5473","10","On second viewing, however, this aspect felt less jarring  as it's evident that Stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused, and that her tenure in Paris has softened her even if she tries to cling to her hard earned wealth for as long as it's possible."
"358","tt0023775","5473","11","Released on DVD by Warners as part of their FORBIDDEN Hollywood VOLUME 1 COLLECTION, the film is presented in two strikingly different edits  a recently unearthed Pre Release version and the tamer Theatrical Release print."
"359","tt0023775","5473","12","Among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to Stanwyck's life as a tramp from the age of 14 though it's heard in the accompanying trailer!, while many other scenes have been shortened i.e. censored for content: the violent fisticuff which develops between Stanwyck and Hohl after she resists his advances; the seduction at the railroad car; the scene in which Dumbrille is surprised with Stanwyck by Cook; the shooting, followed by a suicide only shots are heard in the shorter version; Stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing again, only Brent appears in the version released to theaters, etc."
"360","tt0023775","5473","13","Tha latter, then, utilizes alternate takes for some scenes  and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version; however, we also get an obviously tacked on happy ending the Pre Release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open ended note and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by Ethier to Stanwyck in New York which, basically, has the function of substituting all references to Nietzsche!"
"361","tt0023775","5474","1","The National Gallery of Art showed the long thought lost original uncut version of this film on July 10, 2005."
"362","tt0023775","5474","2","It restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release."
"363","tt0023775","5474","3","The character of the cobbler, a moral goody goody individual in the original censored release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of the philosopher Nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top."
"364","tt0023775","5474","4","Also, the corny ending of the original which I assume is in current VHS versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form."
"365","tt0023775","5474","5","A wonderful film of seduction and power."
"366","tt0023775","5474","6","Hopefully, there will a reissue of this film on DVD for all to appreciate its great qualities."
"367","tt0023775","5474","7","Look for it."
"368","tt0023775","5475","1","Finally, the uncut version of ""Baby Face"" surfaces and from what source."
"369","tt0023775","5475","2","The Library of Congress."
"370","tt0023775","5475","3","The restored four minutes, snippets here and there, make for a much better film."
"371","tt0023775","5475","4","We now know that Baby Face was pimped by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years of age."
"372","tt0023775","5475","5","Another reason d'tat for her behavior and cold, calculating exterior."
"373","tt0023775","5475","6","Barbara Stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of Lily Powers notice the moniker, a part that called for just the right amount of sexuality coated with power, cunning, and revenge, yet tinged with virginal pretense when called for, a very difficult portrayal to make convincing."
"374","tt0023775","5475","7","Barbara Stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top literally, she still has good in her heart note the way she treats those few who have been kind to her such as Chico the marvelous actress Theresa Harris and the old philosopher."
"375","tt0023775","5475","8","And though she exploits her sexuality to make mush of men who are rich and powerful, those same men are attempting to exploit her for their carnal desires with no intention of permanent ties until they fall in love with her."
"376","tt0023775","5475","9","Lily Powers fails to understand, at first, that emotions are difficult to ride, that it's easy to lose control."
"377","tt0023775","5475","10","One possible result is death."
"378","tt0023775","5475","11","Hitching a wagon to a star of course materialism can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but the ephemeral, and it's a cold lonely location."
"379","tt0023775","5475","12","A word should be said about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche whose will to power is stressed in ""Baby Face"" by the elderly philosopher who befriends Lilly when she is still turning tricks for her old man."
"380","tt0023775","5475","13","""Baby Face"" was released the same year Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany."
"381","tt0023775","5475","14","Though it's highly unlikely that the semi literate Hitler understood much about Nietzsche, he considered himself a Nietzschean to the nth degree and touted it along side his other rantings."
"382","tt0023775","5475","15","""Baby Face"" serves as an indictment of the popular interpretation of Nietzsche's will to power concept, especially in the final scenes."
"383","tt0023775","5475","16","Although ""You've got the cutest little baby face."" is apropos as a theme for ""Baby Face,"" an even more telling and applicable melody is W."
"384","tt0023775","5475","17","C."
"385","tt0023775","5475","18","Handy's ""St."

"387","tt0023775","5475","20","""St."
"388","tt0023775","5475","21","Louis Blues"" is also used wisely toward the end as Lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values."

"390","tt0023775","5475","23","Louis Blues"" when Lily, now disagreeing with the lyrics, orders her to stop."
"391","tt0023775","5475","24","The restored version of ""Baby Face"" makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude toward sex as power than many a new Hollywood release."
"392","tt0023775","5475","25","By all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy."
"393","tt0023775","5476","1","""Baby Face"" is a precode melodrama starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck, an almost unrecognizable George Brent, and Theresa Harris."
"394","tt0023775","5476","2","It's about a girl who goes to the city to make good...or should I say make time."
"395","tt0023775","5476","3","Stanwyck's father has been pimping her for one reason or another her whole life in dingy, depressed, filthy Erie, Pennsylvania."
"396","tt0023775","5476","4","After her father dies, one older father type who knows what she's been through and truly cares about her future advises her to go to the big city and take advantage of opportunities there and not the easy ones and to take the high road in life."
"397","tt0023775","5476","5","Note that I saw the censored version and not the uncut this part of the film was redone for the censors."
"398","tt0023775","5476","6","She and Chico Harris go to New York where Lily nickname: Baby Face decides the low road's a lot smoother and will get her where she wants to go a lot faster."
"399","tt0023775","5476","7","In the movie's most famous scene, the camera moves us up the corporate ladder by taking us from floor to floor as Lily sleeps her way to the top."
"400","tt0023775","5476","8","She finally corrals the big man himself and is able to quit her day job."
"401","tt0023775","5476","9","Trouble follows, and she's soon involved in a huge scandal."
"402","tt0023775","5476","10","Stanwyck wears lots of makeup and for most of the film is cool as a cucumber as she seduces one man after another with no regrets, and she's great at playing the innocent victim."
"403","tt0023775","5476","11","In one scene, she sits staring at a king's ransom in jewels while wearing a black dress that looks like it's decorated with diamonds at the top."
"404","tt0023775","5476","12","Then she asks Chico for another case, and that's filled with more jewelry, plus securities."
"405","tt0023775","5476","13","All in a day's work."
"406","tt0023775","5476","14","Theresa Harris was an interesting talent she could be played down or glamorous, and was a talented singer and dancer as well."
"407","tt0023775","5476","15","Here, she sings or hums the movie's theme, ""St."
"408","tt0023775","5476","16","Louis Woman"" throughout."
"409","tt0023775","5476","17","She worked in literally dozens of movies and is very good here as a friend of Stanwyck's, her best work being in the precode era."
"410","tt0023775","5476","18","As a bizarre byproduct of the code, blacks were often given less to do in films after it was put in place."
"411","tt0023775","5476","19","Precode films could be more sexually blatant and therefore, though they're 70+ years old, seem more modern."
"412","tt0023775","5476","20","Even though these films didn't have to have moral endings, Baby Face learns her lessons how like life it is after all."
"413","tt0023775","5476","21","There were several endings of this film, all with the same message."
"414","tt0023775","5476","22","The one I saw had an added scene, but apparently, there were two other endings that didn't pass the censors."
"415","tt0023775","5476","23","There wasn't a code but there were always censors."
"416","tt0023775","5476","24","At any rate, it's a neat surprise."
"417","tt0023775","5476","25","""Baby Face"" is an important film in movie history a must see."
"418","tt0023775","5477","1","An original uncensored print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005."
"419","tt0023775","5477","2","According to current reviews that I've found online, the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact; they were later either removed or completely re shot by the studio prior to initial release, in order to pass the New York state censors."
"420","tt0023775","5477","3","I have also read that a DVD is ""expected in 2006"" and one can only hope!"
"421","tt0023775","5477","4","If we're really luckily, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions."
"422","tt0023775","5477","5","Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen."
"423","tt0023775","5477","6","Stanwyck rules!"
"424","tt0023775","5478","1","No sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that."
"425","tt0023775","5478","2","Here's a few different slants on it from one of those ""religious nuts,"" as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly."
"426","tt0023775","5478","3","1 ""Baby Face"" 1933 offers perhaps THE classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex."
"427","tt0023775","5478","4","There is a lot of truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free.....and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want."
"428","tt0023775","5478","5","In this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....lots of it."
"429","tt0023775","5478","6","At least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process."
"430","tt0023775","5478","7","2 The ending which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled."
"431","tt0023775","5478","8","A sad comment that so many ""critics"" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance."
"432","tt0023775","5478","9","No surprise, I guess."
"433","tt0023775","5478","10","Any way you look at it, the movie is entertaining start to finish and Stanwyck has some great lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers."
"434","tt0023775","5478","11","At a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it."
"435","tt0023775","5479","1","Arriving by boxcar in New York City, the shrewd young woman with the BABY FACE begins to methodically canoodle her way to the top floors of power in a great bank."
"436","tt0023775","5479","2","Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential pre Code drama."
"437","tt0023775","5479","3","Without a shred of decency or regret, she coolly manipulates the removal or destruction of the men unlucky enough to find themselves in her way."
"438","tt0023775","5479","4","A wonderful actress, Stanwyck has full opportunity here to display her ample talents."
"439","tt0023775","5479","5","Appearing quite late in the story, George Brent is a welcome addition as the one fellow possibly able to handle Stanwyck; his sophisticated style of acting makes a nice counterpoint to her icy demeanor."
"440","tt0023775","5479","6","Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook & Henry Kolker portray a succession of her unfortunate victims."
"441","tt0023775","5479","7","John Wayne appears for just a few scant seconds as an unsuccessful suitor for Stanwyck's affections."
"442","tt0023775","5479","8","This would be the only time these two performers appeared together on screen."
"443","tt0023775","5479","9","Movie mavens should recognize Nat Pendleton as a speakeasy customer, and Charles Sellon & Edward Van Sloan as bank executives all unbilled."
"444","tt0023775","5479","10","The music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, perfectly punctuating the plot, is Baby Face' 1926 by Benny Davis & Harry Akst and St."
"445","tt0023775","5479","11","Louis Blues' 1914 by W.C."
"446","tt0023775","5479","12","Handy."
"447","tt0023775","5479","13","BABY FACE is a prime example of pre Code naughtiness."
"448","tt0023775","5479","14","In its frank & unapologetic dealing with sex, it is precisely the kind of film which the implementation of the Production Code in 1934 was meant to eliminate."
"449","tt0033045","2105","1","Set in World Depression Era Prague, this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters, only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop, who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague."
"450","tt0033045","2105","2","Add a little twist the owner is convinced that his favorite employee Stewart is having an affair with the owner's wife, leaving Stewart briefly 'fired', along with an admission that the sales girl 'liked' Stewart all along, the happy ending is inevitable."
"451","tt0033045","2105","3","Although VERY dated references to poverty and I have a wife and two kids to consider are over used, along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure, like a musical cigar box, are out of reach for common people's enjoyment, this film is much more effective and more credible than the 1990s re make ""You've Got Mail""."
"452","tt0033045","2105","4","In the re make starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the actual odds of the chain of events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended."""
"453","tt0033045","2105","5","Shop Around The Corner"" is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated, less hectic, and more romantic time and place known as a novelist's Utopia."
"454","tt0033045","2105","6","Lovers of Classic Romantic Comedies will enjoy this picture!"
"455","tt0033045","2106","1","Would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one."
"456","tt0033045","2106","2","I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement."
"457","tt0033045","2106","3","Margaret Sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought out the best in each other."
"458","tt0033045","2106","4","This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most winning performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot."
"459","tt0033045","2106","5","The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy."
"460","tt0033045","2106","6","Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a triumph."
"461","tt0033045","2106","7","With some of the wittiest dialogue American movies of the 30's has to offer."
"462","tt0033045","2107","1","I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other LaserDiscs from eBay."
"463","tt0033045","2107","2","Usually, I am into war and action movies but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies."
"464","tt0033045","2107","3","If you are bored by today's special FX films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out Shop Around the Corner on a quiet evening."
"465","tt0033045","2107","4","What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency."
"466","tt0033045","2107","5","There is nothing fake or pretentious about them."
"467","tt0033045","2107","6","Take Mr."
"468","tt0033045","2107","7","Matuschek for example: When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself."
"469","tt0033045","2107","8","Not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of Stewart."
"470","tt0033045","2107","9","OK, weired example."
"471","tt0033045","2107","10","Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable."
"472","tt0033045","2107","11","Yet still, I liked it a lot."
"473","tt0033045","2107","12","If you likes Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart."
"474","tt0033045","2108","1","A warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it."
"475","tt0033045","2108","2","The key to this film's success is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low key, unfussy performances."
"476","tt0033045","2108","3","As a result, you fall in love with virtually all of them."
"477","tt0033045","2108","4","There's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which I appreciated."
"478","tt0033045","2108","5","Loneliness is a major theme, most obviously represented in the character of the shop's owner and manager, played wonderfully by Frank Morgan."
"479","tt0033045","2108","6","He discovers that he's being cuckolded by his wife, and realizes that the successful life he's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it."
"480","tt0033045","2108","7","This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant, because they're both reaching out to this unseen other, who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met."
"481","tt0033045","2108","8","Of course we know everything will turn out right in the end, but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy."
"482","tt0033045","2108","9","Lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry."
"483","tt0033045","2108","10","The little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family, and that's exactly how it feels to us as well."
"484","tt0033045","2108","11","This is a wonderful, unsung romance."
"485","tt0033045","2108","12","Grade: A+"
"486","tt0033045","2109","1","I have passed several times on watching this since I figured it was some dumb, sappy, dated romantic comedy."
"487","tt0033045","2109","2","Well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated."
"488","tt0033045","2109","3","However, it is not overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness."
"489","tt0033045","2109","4","You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out quite as you had expected."
"490","tt0033045","2109","5","But, there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic."
"491","tt0033045","2109","6","If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them."
"492","tt0033045","2110","1","So much has been written about the film's plot, the wonderful acting performance, the script, the melancholy, bittersweet atmosphere, the superb direction what can I add."
"493","tt0033045","2110","2","Just watch for one of the most heart warming, beautifully acted, poignant scenes ever filmed."
"494","tt0033045","2110","3","It is Christmas eve and Frank Morgan's character the owner of the shop Mr."
"495","tt0033045","2110","4","Matuschekis recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt."
"496","tt0033045","2110","5","As each of his employees leave he invites them to a Christmas dinner."
"497","tt0033045","2110","6","Each and everyone of them politely turn him down."
"498","tt0033045","2110","7","They all have plans for their own Christmas eve."
"499","tt0033045","2110","8","At this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene."
"500","tt0033045","2110","9","Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears."
"501","tt0033045","2110","10","Thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene."
"502","tt0033045","2110","11","The new employee, the errand boy, is the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snowy street scene."
"503","tt0033045","2110","12","Desperately Mr."
"504","tt0033045","2110","13","Matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him, he will treat him to all the wonderful Christmas food that this errand boy has probably never seen!"
"505","tt0033045","2110","14","The chap is overwhelmed, he too is obviously as lonely as Mr."
"506","tt0033045","2110","15","Matuschek and together they can have a wonderful Christmas meal."
"507","tt0033045","2110","16","Every time I see this scene it moves me."
"508","tt0033045","2110","17","If you manage to get the delightful DVD look at the great trailer with Frank Morgan introducing himself as Mr."
"509","tt0033045","2110","18","Matuschek and an appearance by the director of the film the talented Ernst Lubitsch."
"510","tt0033045","2110","19","This film is a joy from beginning to end."
"511","tt0033045","2111","1","'The Shop Around the Corner 1940' is a pleasant romantic comedy, not the sort that I will hold dear to me until the end of my days, but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation."
"512","tt0033045","2111","2","By 1940, director Ernst Lubitsch had long ago taken Hollywood by storm, and his famed ""Lubitsch touch"" had become a sparkling commercial trademark."
"513","tt0033045","2111","3","This film was planned for a 1939 release, but scheduling conflicts meant that James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were unavailable for filming."
"514","tt0033045","2111","4","Rather than substituting either of his main stars, Lubitsch decided to postpone production, in the meantime directing Greta Garbo in 'Ninotchka 1939.'"
"515","tt0033045","2111","5","When it was finally completed, 'The Shop Around the Corner' appears to have been met with relative indifference, receiving zero Oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by Samson Raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and Frank Morgan in a supporting role."
"516","tt0033045","2111","6","Time, nevertheless, has betrayed the film's massive and enduring influence, with high profile remakes including 'In the Good Old Summertime 1949' and 'You've Got Mail 1998.'"
"517","tt0033045","2111","7","At its surface, one might assume 'The Shop Around the Corner' to simply be the story of two lovers, Klara Novak Sullavan and Alfred Kralik Stewart, who love each other without knowing it."
"518","tt0033045","2111","8","However, Lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that."
"519","tt0033045","2111","9","It's the story of Matuschek and Company, a stylish gift shop in Budapest, and the various human relationships that make the store such a close knit family."
"520","tt0033045","2111","10","When store owner Hugo Matuschek Frank Morgan begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife, we witness the breakdown of two families, both at home and at work."
"521","tt0033045","2111","11","There's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the United States  perhaps in the blustery streets of New York  but Lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in Europe, the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep."
"522","tt0033045","2111","12","This subtle subtext brings a more meaningful, personal touch to the film  in fact, even as I write this review, I'm beginning to appreciate the story even more."
"523","tt0033045","2111","13","Sullavan and Stewart are both lovely in their respective roles, but I think that it's the supporting cast that really make the film."
"524","tt0033045","2111","14","Each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix, and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable."
"525","tt0033045","2111","15","I especially liked how Lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards Hugo Matuschek, who, in any other film, would have been restricted to an underdeveloped, two dimensional portrayal."
"526","tt0033045","2111","16","Matuschek may have lost the love of his family, but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees, and you feel a heartwarming glow when, in the bitter cold of a Christmas Eve snowstorm, he finds companionship in a freckle faced young errand boy Charles Smith."
"527","tt0033045","2111","17","This genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of Billy Wilder's later creations, for example, Boom Boom Jackson in 'The Fortune Cookie 1966' or Carlo Carlucci in 'Avanti!"
"528","tt0033045","2111","18","1972.'"
"529","tt0033045","2111","19","Of course, it doesn't really need saying, but Billy Wilder learned from the best."
"530","tt0033045","2112","1","In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan as Klara Novak gets a job as clerk in a gift shop; there, she bickers with co worker James Stewart as Alfred Kralik."
"531","tt0033045","2112","2","The two don't get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal."
"532","tt0033045","2112","3","Watching Ernst Lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying."
"533","tt0033045","2112","4","Even better is a sub plot involving shop owner Frank Morgan as Hugo Matuschek, who suspects his wife is having an affair."
"534","tt0033045","2112","5","Hiring a private detective, Mr."
"535","tt0033045","2112","6","Morgan confirms his wife of 22 years is having sex with one of his younger employees."
"536","tt0033045","2112","7","Morgan, painfully realizing, ""She just didn't want to grow old with me,"" and the supporting characters are what keeps this film from getting old."
"537","tt0033045","2112","8","The Shop Around the Corner 1/12/40 Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut"
"538","tt0033045","2113","1","The location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film, Balta Street in Budapest but it could really be in any place."
"539","tt0033045","2113","2","The small number of sets reflect a middle European design but it could be a shop around any corner."
"540","tt0033045","2113","3","The film is not about Budapest or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love, reflected in most of the main characters."
"541","tt0033045","2113","4","Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance, and the story unwinds to bring these two aspects together beautifully."
"542","tt0033045","2113","5","Hugo Matuschek, the owner of the shop, is having trouble with his wife, she only a voice at the end of the phone."
"543","tt0033045","2113","6","Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair."
"544","tt0033045","2113","7","Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments."
"545","tt0033045","2113","8","Mr Pirovitch's life is centred around his wife and children."
"546","tt0033045","2113","9","Pepi Katona 'plays Santa Claus' to a girl at Christmas."
"547","tt0033045","2113","10","You even sense that quiet Flora Katchuck, while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone."
"548","tt0033045","2113","11","The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama."
"549","tt0033045","2113","12","It moves effortlessly from scene to scene."
"550","tt0033045","2113","13","It is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again, simple yet profound."
"551","tt0033045","2113","14","The dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days."
"552","tt0033045","2113","15","All the acting is magnificent."
"553","tt0033045","2113","16","Even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect."
"554","tt0033045","2113","17","James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other perfectly."
"555","tt0033045","2113","18","He was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance."
"556","tt0033045","2113","19","Margaret Sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days."
"557","tt0033045","2113","20","Some of her other films are worth catching."
"558","tt0033045","2113","21","As Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing."
"559","tt0033045","2113","22","His moment of truth is very moving."
"560","tt0033045","2113","23","Gold stars all round to the performers."
"561","tt0033045","2113","24","It is a well worn phrase that they don't make them like they used to The vague re make 'You've Got Mail' was dire but in this case it is true."
"562","tt0033045","2113","25","The director Lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity."
"563","tt0033045","2114","1","Two warring shop workers in a leather goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box number aliases."
"564","tt0033045","2114","2","Within this simple idea and an everyday setting, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit, drama, poignancy and irony that never lets up."
"565","tt0033045","2114","3","Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well developed characters have their own sub plots and in jokes."
"566","tt0033045","2114","4","Although wrongly eclipsed by Stewart's big films of 39/40 Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr Smith this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlties unseen in the other films."
"567","tt0033045","2115","1","After seeing You've Got Mail and feeling disappointed, I decided to see the original movie which inspired this one, The Shop Around the Corner."
"568","tt0033045","2115","2","I was amazed at this movie."
"569","tt0033045","2115","3","It's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times."
"570","tt0033045","2115","4","The acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, that if you haven't seen it, I wish to urge you to see it today."
"571","tt0033045","2115","5","I'm not against re makes and sometimes I like the new version more than the original one, but this time have to admit that You've Got Mail is a poor adaption of this classic."
"572","tt0033045","2115","6","Don't miss it, go to your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!"
"573","tt0033045","2116","1","Has there ever been a movie more charming than this."
"574","tt0033045","2116","2","One of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives."
"575","tt0033045","2116","3","The center of it is the ""romance"" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals."
"576","tt0033045","2116","4","But there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including ""You've Got Mail"", the recent update of ""Shop"" they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs."
"577","tt0033045","2116","5","Everyone gets to be an intricate part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm."
"578","tt0033045","2116","6","One of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near tragic Frank Morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have Christmas dinner with."

"581","tt0033045","2117","1","Every time I watch this movie I am more impressed by the whole production."
"582","tt0033045","2117","2","I have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made."
"583","tt0033045","2117","3","Everyone involved is perfect; script, acting, direction, sets and editing."
"584","tt0033045","2117","4","Whilst James Stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance, and the supporting cast are magnificent, it is Margaret Sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was."
"585","tt0033045","2117","5","Her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve."
"586","tt0033045","2117","6","Lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best."
"587","tt0033045","2117","7","Watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take breathtaking."
"588","tt0033045","2118","1","THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is one of the sweetest and most feel good romantic comedies ever made."
"589","tt0033045","2118","2","There's just no getting around that, and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words."
"590","tt0033045","2118","3","It's not one of those films that tries too hard, nor does it come up with the oddest possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end."
"591","tt0033045","2118","4","In fact, all its charm is innate, contained within the characters and the setting and the plot... which is highly believable to boot."
"592","tt0033045","2118","5","It's easy to think that such a love story, as beautiful as any other ever told, could happen to you... a feeling you don't often get from other romantic comedies, however sweet and heart warming they may be."
"593","tt0033045","2118","6","Alfred Kralik James Stewart and Clara Novak Margaret Sullavan don't have the most auspicious of first meetings when she arrives in the shop Matuschek & Co. he's been working in for the past nine years, asking for a job."
"594","tt0033045","2118","7","They clash from the very beginning, mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it's opened he thinks it's a ludicrous idea; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired."
"595","tt0033045","2118","8","Their bickering takes them through the next six months, even as they both unconsciously, of course!"
"596","tt0033045","2118","9","fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through PO Box 237."
"597","tt0033045","2118","10","This would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on, except that THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is expertly fleshed out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters, from the fatherly but lonely Hugo Matuschek Frank Morgan himself, who learns that his shop really is his home; Pirovitch Felix Bressart, Kralik's sidekick and friend who always skitters out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion; smarmy pimp du jour Vadas Joseph Schildkraut who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous Kralik; and ambitious errand boy Pepi Katona William Tracy who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for Matuschek & Co."
"598","tt0033045","2118","11","The unpretentious love story between 'Dear Friends' is played out in this little shop in Budapest, Hungary, in which Kralik's unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirds to be along."
"599","tt0033045","2118","12","It's nice that everyone gets a story in this film; the supporting characters are well developed, and Matuschek's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one Alfred and Clara share."
"600","tt0033045","2118","13","His invitation to new errand boy Rudy Charles Smith for Christmas Eve dinner, made in the whirling, beautiful snow of a Hungarian winter, makes the audience glad that he is not alone; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it isn't this film's business to tell."
"601","tt0033045","2118","14","Aside from the love story, I must say that James Stewart is truly one of the best things about this film."
"602","tt0033045","2118","15","He doesn't play the full fledged Jimmy Stewart persona in this film c/f 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' for that; in fact Alfred Kralik is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind."
"603","tt0033045","2118","16","He's rather a brusque man, in fact, with little hint until, perhaps, the very end of the aw shucks down home boyish charm Stewart would soon come to patent."
"604","tt0033045","2118","17","When he finds out before Clara that they have been corresponding in secret, in fact, Kralik doesn't 'fess up he waits it out to see how far he can take the charade, especially since he quickly realises given his stormy relationship with Clara as boss and underling that loving the person he knows through the exchanged letters might not equate with loving the person herself."
"605","tt0033045","2118","18","His description to Clara of the fictional Matthias Popkin what a name!"
"606","tt0033045","2118","19","who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme, but also his way of proving that the letters don't reveal all there is to a man, just as her letters don't reveal all there is to her."
"607","tt0033045","2118","20","Stewart plays this role perfectly he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever Clara insults Mr."
"608","tt0033045","2118","21","Kralik, as she is often wont to do, even and especially to his face."
"609","tt0033045","2118","22","And yet one believes, underneath the brusqueness and professionalism, that he could reveal his identity with as much earnestness and sincerity and sheer hope as he eventually does."
"610","tt0033045","2118","23","Special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well."
"611","tt0033045","2118","24","Margaret Sullavan fares rather less well in the first half of the film, but she really comes into her own in the closing shop scene on Christmas Eve, when she almost gets her heart broken again by Alfred's most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart."
"612","tt0033045","2118","25","Frank Morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous Hugo Matuschek driven to nervous breakdown, the man who has to rediscover his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to 'grow old with him'."
"613","tt0033045","2118","26","And Felix Bressart plays the role of the meek but loyal Pirovitch wonderfully a Lubitsch regular, since he appears as a hilarious Russian ambassador in NINOTCHKA of particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend Alfred get the Christmas present the latter really wants... a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box Clara is so hung up on."
"614","tt0033045","2118","27","Ernst Lubitsch really does himself proud with this film for example, the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the Matuschek shop is well worth the effort, right down to the Hungarian names on the door, the wares and the cash register and so on."
"615","tt0033045","2118","28","But even though Lubitsch chose to have the story set in Hungary, the setting is actually universal: it could happen anywhere; it could happen to you."
"616","tt0033045","2118","29","Therein lies the charm of this simple story, these believable characters who really are people."
"617","tt0033045","2118","30","The snow on Christmas Eve is real as well, or at least as real as Lubitsch could make it he had snow machines brought in at great expense."
"618","tt0033045","2118","31","It is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable, that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be replicated."
"619","tt0033045","2118","32","No, not even in a remake like YOU'VE GOT MAIL."
"620","tt0033045","2118","33","This is really the Jimmy Stewart Christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE."
"621","tt0033045","2118","34","Not to detract from the merits of that other film, but there'd be no harm, and in fact a lot of good, done in watching THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER this Christmas instead."
"622","tt0033045","2118","35","It's sweet, funny, charming, and Stewart is impeccable in his role."
"623","tt0033045","2118","36","We should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could."
"624","tt0033045","2119","1","""The Shop Around the Corner"" is one of the great films from director Ernst Lubitsch."
"625","tt0033045","2119","2","In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it's filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart ."
"626","tt0033045","2119","3","They're the type of character actors that Hollywood sadly no longer employs."
"627","tt0033045","2119","4","In fact, the film itself is the kind of movie that Hollywood doesn't make anymore."
"628","tt0033045","2119","5","The makers of ""You've Got Mail"" claim their film to be a remake, but that's just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise."
"629","tt0033045","2119","6","Anyway, if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940's, you'll find ""The Shop Around the Corner"" to be nothing short of wonderful."
"630","tt0033045","2119","7","Just as good with repeat viewings."
"631","tt0033045","2119","8","Enjoy!"
"632","tt0033045","2120","1","James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co workers in a Budapest gift shop who don't really like each other, not knowing they're really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meet."
"633","tt0033045","2120","2","A very charming romantic comedy, very engagingly played by it's two likable stars and a very eager to please supporting cast."
"634","tt0033045","2120","3","The story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence don't quite know how to explain it that films today just don't have."
"635","tt0033045","2120","4","This can obviously be compared to the recent You've Got Mail, and the original wins in every way."
"636","tt0033045","2120","5","This is mandatory viewing each Christmas, I can't think of a better way to jumpstart a Christmas feel than this little gem."
"637","tt0033045","2121","1","This is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players."
"638","tt0033045","2121","2","It will make you laugh and it will make you cry."
"639","tt0033045","2121","3","The very end of the movie gets me to mist up every time."
"640","tt0033045","2121","4","If you want to see a great movie, this is it."
"641","tt0033045","2121","5","Jimmy Stewert supplies a wonderfully witty performance and Frank Morgan as Mr."
"642","tt0033045","2121","6","Matuschek is spellbinding."
"643","tt0033045","2121","7","Morgan's diversity of character is nothing short of amazing."
"644","tt0033045","2121","8","William Tracy as Pepi is terrific comic relief and delivers some of the movies most important lines and performances."
"645","tt0033045","2121","9","Felix Bressart delivers a fantastic performance as Perovitch, a stumbling bumbling shop worker who's life's ambition is to please those he works with."
"646","tt0033045","2121","10","It is a simple story of how close co workers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances."
"647","tt0033045","2122","1","Back in the day of the big studio system, the darndest casting decisions were made."
"648","tt0033045","2122","2","Good old all American James Stewart appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner."
"649","tt0033045","2122","3","Had I been casting the film, the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer."
"650","tt0033045","2122","4","His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing."
"651","tt0033045","2122","5","Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan."
"652","tt0033045","2122","6","Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her."
"653","tt0033045","2122","7","But is only this one where neither of them dies."
"654","tt0033045","2122","8","Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in New York."
"655","tt0033045","2122","9","In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then."
"656","tt0033045","2122","10","I think only Clark Gable was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty."
"657","tt0033045","2122","11","Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out."
"658","tt0033045","2122","12","But if you can accept Stewart, than you'll be seeing a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch."
"659","tt0033045","2122","13","The plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest don't get along in person."
"660","tt0033045","2122","14","But it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other."
"661","tt0033045","2122","15","Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife."
"662","tt0033045","2122","16","Though the leads are fine and Frank Morgan departs from his usual befuddled self, the two players who come off best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut."
"663","tt0033045","2122","17","Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions."
"664","tt0033045","2122","18","He makes himself very scarce."
"665","tt0033045","2122","19","And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to Frank Morgan."
"666","tt0033045","2122","20","You really hate people like that, I've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day."
"667","tt0033045","2122","21","Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time."
"668","tt0033045","2123","1","Of the three remakes of this plot, I like them all, I have all three on VHS and in addition have a copy of this one on DVD."
"669","tt0033045","2123","2","There is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re watchable."
"670","tt0033045","2123","3","In addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each."
"671","tt0033045","2123","4","Of course the main stars in this one are great, but the supporting actors are also superb."
"672","tt0033045","2123","5","I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi."
"673","tt0033045","2123","6","He was such a scene stealer that I have searched to find other movies he is in."
"674","tt0033045","2123","7","He appeared in many, but most are not available."
"675","tt0033045","2123","8","As the other comments, I also say buy this one."
"676","tt0033045","2124","1","This is a truly classic movie in its story, acting, and film presentation."
"677","tt0033045","2124","2","Wonderful actors are replete throughout the whole movie, Miss Sullivan, and Jimmy Stewart being the foremost characters."
"678","tt0033045","2124","3","In real life she greatly admired, and liked Jimmy, and indeed gave him his basically first acting roles, and helped him be more calm with his appearance on the set."
"679","tt0033045","2124","4","The ""chemistry"" between the two was always apparent, and so warm and enjoyable to behold."
"680","tt0033045","2124","5","She was such a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality portrayals."
"681","tt0033045","2124","6","The story of these two young people, and how they eventually come together in the end is charming to watch, and pure magical entertainment."
"682","tt0033045","2124","7","Heart warming presentations are also given by the other supporting actors in this marvelous story/movie."
"683","tt0033045","2124","8","I whole heartily give Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, that has a special appeal for all generations."
"684","tt0033045","2124","9","A must see for all!"
"685","tt0033045","2125","1","This, despite not being the original it began life as a play in Central Europe has weathered the several incarnations that followed MGM's own remake with period songs In The Good Old Summertime, the Broadway show She Loves Me, even the excellent theatre revival in Paris a couple of years ago and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat."
"686","tt0033045","2125","2","Several previous commenters have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s Hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today try, for example, removing Ugarte, Ferrari, Renault etc from Casablanca and yes you'd still have Rick and Ilsa and Viktor Lazslo but they'd just be frosting without the rich cake mixture below."
"687","tt0033045","2125","3","Jimmy Stewart and Maggie Sullavan WERE both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, Joseph Schildkraut and Andy Hardy's Sara Haden and this is BEFORE we factor in that Lubitsch 'touch'."
"688","tt0033045","2125","4","Okay, maybe they WERE a tad more naive, innocent even, in that Jurassic Age but how many genuine film lovers, sated with scatology, screwing and in your face sex, turn back to those days of Stories, Style, Slickness and Skill and wallow in great movies like this one."
"689","tt0033045","2125","5","By far the best thing about this technological age is not CSI but DVD that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the Matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it."
"690","tt0033045","2126","1","Much about love & life can be learned from watching the folks at THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.Ernst Lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film."
"691","tt0033045","2126","2","With sparkling dialogue courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie."
"692","tt0033045","2126","3","Always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers, and favoring sophistication over slapstick, the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive, enigmatic quality known as the Lubitsch touch.'"
"693","tt0033045","2126","4","Although the story is set in Budapest and there is a jumble of accents among the players this is of no consequence."
"694","tt0033045","2126","5","The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great American city or small town could easily be the locus for the action."
"695","tt0033045","2126","6","Jimmy Stewart & Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other without knowing it."
"696","tt0033045","2126","7","Their dialogue so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural perfectly conveys their confusion & quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates."
"697","tt0033045","2126","8","Theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema."
"698","tt0033045","2126","9","Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold."
"699","tt0033045","2126","10","An accomplished scene stealer, he allows no emotion to escape unvented."
"700","tt0033045","2126","11","Additionally, Morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments near the end when he determines that his store's newest employee, an impoverished youth, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve."
"701","tt0033045","2126","12","Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals, this time that of a toadying, sycophantic Lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him."
"702","tt0033045","2126","13","Gentle Felix Bressart has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop intrigues, yet remains a steadfast friend to Stewart."
"703","tt0033045","2126","14","Sara Haden graces the small role of a sales clerk."
"704","tt0033045","2126","15","William Tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force."
"705","tt0033045","2126","16","In tiny roles, Charles Halton plays a no nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous doctor."
"706","tt0033045","2126","17","Movie mavens will recognize Mary Carr & Mabel Colcord both uncredited in their single scene as Miss Sullavan's grandmother & aunt."
"707","tt0033045","2127","1","Calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading."
"708","tt0033045","2127","2","The genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formulaic and overly predictable."
"709","tt0033045","2127","3","The Shop Around the Corner does not suffer from these illnesses: it manages to create a recognisably middle/eastern European atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the also strong nominal leads; I avoid using the words 'supporting cast' as for example Mr."
"710","tt0033045","2127","4","Matuschek Frank Morgan has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance."
"711","tt0033045","2127","5","The 1998 film You've Got Mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen pal' idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake."
"712","tt0033045","2127","6","This is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie it shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that is all."
"713","tt0033045","2128","1","I just watched this on Turner Classic Movies Last night, for the first time ever seeing it, and I loved it."
"714","tt0033045","2128","2","I like lots of the older films, especially because of the absence of all the filthy language, and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's films."
"715","tt0033045","2128","3","I also think they were made much better in many but not all cases."
"716","tt0033045","2128","4","Jimmy Stewart is a special favorite of mine."
"717","tt0033045","2128","5","I just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and I enjoyed it thoroughly."
"718","tt0033045","2128","6","If you feel the same way about the older films I don't think you can go wrong with this one."
"719","tt0033045","2128","7","I believe ""You've Got Mail"" is a remakeeven though slightly different and also a very enjoyable film. of this film."
"720","tt0033045","2128","8","For a relaxing evening with a movie you don't have to be ashamed of if your kids or anyone walks in on your viewing, get this,or catch it on one of the classic movie channels."
"721","tt0033045","2129","1","Sweet romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is."
"722","tt0033045","2129","2","Naturally, they work together and can't stand each other."
"723","tt0033045","2129","3","You can guess the rest."
"724","tt0033045","2129","4","It's beautifully acted by the entire cast especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan, has a witty, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning."
"725","tt0033045","2129","5","It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself believing I was seeing Budapest!"
"726","tt0033045","2129","6","Everything looks so perfect and dream like."
"727","tt0033045","2129","7","A one of a kind film."
"728","tt0033045","2129","8","Don't miss it!"
"729","tt0033045","2130","1","A wonderful film, filled with great understated performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue."
"730","tt0033045","2130","2","What really distinguishes the film, however, is that undercurrent of sadness throughout."
"731","tt0033045","2130","3","The story is underscored by affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences."
"732","tt0033045","2130","4","Most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed, having been ripped apart by the beginning of World War II."
"733","tt0033045","2130","5","In fact, the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to the comic scenes."
"734","tt0033045","2130","6","Yet funny it is listen to Margaret Sullivan's harsh dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and watch his pained expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend ""of poetry and meanness""."
"735","tt0033045","2130","7","It's funny, pointed, and sad all at once."
"736","tt0033045","2130","8","A remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made."
"737","tt0033045","2131","1","This is a movie that gets better each time I see it."
"738","tt0033045","2131","2","There are so many nuanced performances in this."
"739","tt0033045","2131","3","William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief."
"740","tt0033045","2131","4","Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only ""villian"" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here."
"741","tt0033045","2131","5","Frank Morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, Mr."
"742","tt0033045","2131","6","Matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here."
"743","tt0033045","2131","7","I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch."
"744","tt0033045","2131","8","Very believable in every facet of his role."
"745","tt0033045","2131","9","The two leads are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman."
"746","tt0033045","2131","10","This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though."
"747","tt0033045","2131","11","The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him."
"748","tt0033045","2131","12","Mr."
"749","tt0033045","2131","13","Stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions."
"750","tt0033045","2131","14","Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding."
"751","tt0033045","2131","15","He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly."
"752","tt0033045","2131","16","In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium."
"753","tt0033045","2131","17","There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience."
"754","tt0033045","2131","18","At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft."
"755","tt0033045","2131","19","This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find."
"756","tt0033045","2131","20","I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart."
"757","tt0033045","2132","1","The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man vs. woman argue all the time but wind up in love type of Hollywood screwball romance/comedy."
"758","tt0033045","2132","2","I usually don't go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, and oozes with charm."
"759","tt0033045","2132","3","Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other well and make a very handsome couple."
"760","tt0033045","2132","4","The supporting cast is outstanding from the always likable Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut."
"761","tt0033045","2132","5","Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him do in his career."
"762","tt0033045","2132","6","He takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him."
"763","tt0033045","2132","7","That ""twist"" is another reason this film rises above others of its kind."
"764","tt0033045","2132","8","Once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds."
"765","tt0033045","2132","9","This is a great example of that."
"766","tt0033045","2132","10","In this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done."
"767","tt0033045","2132","11","I'll take this over the re make ""You've Got Mail,"" any day."
"768","tt0033045","2132","12","No comparison."
"769","tt0033045","2133","1","I have lost count of just how many times I have seen this movie I probably know the entire dialog backwards yet I am drawn to it time and again."
"770","tt0033045","2133","2","Set in Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the eligible bachelor ""Kralik"" who becomes the secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan's innocent ""Klara""."
"771","tt0033045","2133","3","Kralik secretly becomes Klara's pen friend, and at work together Klara confides in Kralik about the content of his Kralik's letters."
"772","tt0033045","2133","4","Clearly Kralik is besotted with Klara but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the ""pen friend""."
"773","tt0033045","2133","5","Confused."
"774","tt0033045","2133","6","Well you wont be this story has a sweet, almost sugary ending but we all know it is the ending we all want."
"775","tt0033045","2133","7","Other characters worth mentioning are Frank Morgan playing his usual role, this time as the shop's owner ""Hugo Matuschek"", Felix Bressart as ""Pirovitch"", Kralik's confidant."
"776","tt0033045","2133","8","Joseph Schildkraut as the womanising arrogant ""Vadas"" so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning."
"777","tt0033045","2133","9","Finally William Tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his over confident upstart of a shop junior ""Pepi Katona""."
"778","tt0033045","2133","10","Recently re made as ""You've Got Mail"" starring Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original although I suspect younger audiences would disagree."
"779","tt0033045","2133","11","If this film is on in your area over Christmas, I suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of Kleenex handy."
"780","tt0033045","2134","1","Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to the American cinema is enormous."
"781","tt0033045","2134","2","His legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever, as is the case with ""The Shop Around the Corner""."
"782","tt0033045","2134","3","This film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play, without the charm or elegance of Mr."
"783","tt0033045","2134","4","Lubitsch's own, and definite version."
"784","tt0033045","2134","5","Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked in several films together."
"785","tt0033045","2134","6","Their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all."
"786","tt0033045","2134","7","Both stars are delightful as the pen pals that don't know of one another, but who fate had them working together in the same shop in Budapest."
"787","tt0033045","2134","8","The reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture."
"788","tt0033045","2134","9","In here, we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, playing the owner of the shop."
"789","tt0033045","2134","10","Also, we see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing impressive work in making us believe that yes, they are in Budapest."
"790","tt0033045","2134","11","That is why these films will live forever!"
"791","tt0033152","10389","1","I saw this movie when I was a child."
"792","tt0033152","10389","2","It blew me away."
"793","tt0033152","10389","3","This was before the days of television, so a movie of this magnitude, could send a young kid into orbit."
"794","tt0033152","10389","4","It so impressed me, that I went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days."
"795","tt0033152","10389","5","The special effects used at this time were far ahead of its' time."
"796","tt0033152","10389","6","Sabu was a real delight, as was Rex Ingram as the Genie."
"797","tt0033152","10389","7","I found myself singing ""I want to be a sailor"" for months after the film left town."
"798","tt0033152","10389","8","I would recommend this movie to any and everyone."
"799","tt0033152","10389","9","I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was as villainous a character as you'd ever want to meet."
"800","tt0033152","10389","10","Also, June Duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture."
"801","tt0033152","10389","11","The color was outstanding."
"802","tt0033152","10389","12","Give this movie an AAA!"
"803","tt0033152","10390","1","Next to ""Star Wars"" and ""The Wizard of Oz,"" this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made."
"804","tt0033152","10390","2","It's a true shame it's not as well known as the former films maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci fi settings, and that it's British, meaning a smaller market for films but its wonderful to know that it's deserved that reputation."
"805","tt0033152","10390","3","Like all great family films, one can be a child, an adult, or even a teenager to enjoy this film I'm currently 18, but one must appreciate classic films first."
"806","tt0033152","10390","4","I absolutely adore this film."
"807","tt0033152","10390","5","It has an extraordinary music score by Miklos Rozsa perhaps my favorite classic film score that rivals any John Williams ""Star Wars"" score, a fast but not flashy pace, beautiful sets, dialog, and use of color both the sets and cinematography won Oscars, and state of the art Oscar winning special effects for the time, and some are still stunning."
"808","tt0033152","10390","6","And, of course, June Duprez's sultry looks as the Princess rivals that of Catherine Zeta Jones' she even looks like Jones in a way!."
"809","tt0033152","10390","7","In conclusion, this is one of my all time favorite movie next to ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and it truly deserves more attention."
"810","tt0033152","10390","8","It is a true adventure of enchantment throughout, and, along with ""Robin Hood,"" it's my desert island film that I could watch over and over again without getting annoyed."
"811","tt0033152","10390","9","Stars:  excellent"
"812","tt0033152","10391","1","It is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful, colorful production, and, to adults, for a literate script, fine production values, good casting/acting, all bound together with a fine Rozsa score."
"813","tt0033152","10391","2","Two roughly contemporary films accomplish this ""Thief of Baghdad"" 1940 and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" 1938."
"814","tt0033152","10391","3","Some of the back story on this production is fascinating."
"815","tt0033152","10391","4","This production, commenced in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood, and proved a cover for British intelligence efforts!"
"816","tt0033152","10391","5","The producer, Alexander Korda, was subsequently knighted in 1942."
"817","tt0033152","10391","6","Here is a unique case of the intersection of art, commerce, and politics!"
"818","tt0033152","10391","7","By all means, secure a good CD of this film for your library!"
"819","tt0033152","10392","1","This is a beautiful movie filled with adventure."
"820","tt0033152","10392","2","The Genii in the bottle is a classic scene."
"821","tt0033152","10392","3","Romantic in it's finish, all things turn out as they should be."
"822","tt0033152","10392","4","I saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy I wished was true."
"823","tt0033152","10393","1","Let's cut a long story short."
"824","tt0033152","10393","2","I loved every minute of it."
"825","tt0033152","10393","3","A lavish fantasy in true Arabian Nights style."
"826","tt0033152","10393","4","There's an evil magician, a pretty princess, a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after."
"827","tt0033152","10393","5","Modern Hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic."
"828","tt0033152","10393","6","Only quibble: the special effects are pretty dated loved Sabu with the djinn's foot, though!"
"829","tt0033152","10394","1","A magical journey concocted by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell."
"830","tt0033152","10394","2","These two TITANS of the British cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece!"
"831","tt0033152","10394","3","Some of the most ravishing early Technicolor, a SUBLIME and shimmering Miklos Rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of Sabu, the theatrical and malevolent villainy of Conrad Veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of June Duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well."
"832","tt0033152","10394","4","Miles Malleson who plays Duprez father, the Sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose."
"833","tt0033152","10394","5","DON'T MISS THIS ONE!"
"834","tt0033152","10394","6","Since posting the above comments, I have obtained the recently released DVD and can honestly say I'd never seen the picture properly until viewing this DVD version The clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that I was stunned This amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer."
"835","tt0033152","10394","7","Again, A MUST SEE!"
"836","tt0033152","10395","1","A fantastic Arabian adventure."
"837","tt0033152","10395","2","A former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu played by Sabu of Black Narcissus search for Ahmad's love interest, who has been stolen by the new king, Jaffar Conrad Veidt."
"838","tt0033152","10395","3","There's hardly a down moment here."
"839","tt0033152","10395","4","It's always inventing new adventures for the heroes."
"840","tt0033152","10395","5","Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a little boring there's no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is listed fourth in the credits."
"841","tt0033152","10395","6","Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, makes a great villain, and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves, who at one point finds a genie in a bottle."
"842","tt0033152","10395","7","I also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra, the father of the princess."
"843","tt0033152","10395","8","He collects amazing toys from around the world."
"844","tt0033152","10395","9","Jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse."
"845","tt0033152","10395","10","This probably would count as one of the great children's films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays."
"846","tt0033152","10395","11","Kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when Abu and the genie are on screen together."
"847","tt0033152","10395","12","And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful."
"848","tt0033152","10395","13","Although most of the younger generation probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at this point in time, Willis O'Brien's stop motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look remotely like a spider."
"849","tt0033152","10395","14","8/10."
"850","tt0033152","10396","1","This was usually producer Alexander Korda's advice on set to many of his underlings; the film is credited with three directors but in truth Alex, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped out, pushing it to six."
"851","tt0033152","10396","2","For John Kobal's 1987 book, ""The Top 100 Movies"", his survey of 81 film critics saw The Thief of Bagdad reach 55th place."
"852","tt0033152","10396","3","A closer examination reveals only Jose Luis Guarner, John Russell Taylor and Kobal himself actually voted for the picture, but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half way mark."
"853","tt0033152","10396","4","The outbreak of the Second World War saw the movie's production shifted around England and America, eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical Oscars."
"854","tt0033152","10396","5","Like Citizen Kane, it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love."
"855","tt0033152","10396","6","The special effects, outstanding for the time, are still reasonable, and actually hold up if you squint."
"856","tt0033152","10396","7","But it's not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions."
"857","tt0033152","10396","8","Among them is an amusing horse, constructed out of a kit model, which, when a key is inserted up it's rear end, begins to fly."
"858","tt0033152","10396","9","There's also a killer toy of the six armed Goddess Kali, perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her and a quite horrific looking giant spider."
"859","tt0033152","10396","10","Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet."
"860","tt0033152","10396","11","But most memorable has to be Rex Ingram appearing as, in a superb moment of cinematic conceit, a djinn genie nearly a thousand feet tall!"
"861","tt0033152","10396","12","Ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature, and adds an element of danger to the proceedings."
"862","tt0033152","10396","13","And look out for the moment where he's tricked back into his bottle!"
"863","tt0033152","10396","14","John Justin does well as the Arabic king who, for some strange reason, has an English accent and a stiff upper lip."
"864","tt0033152","10396","15","Sabu, the astonishingly muscled 15year old, is near namesake Abu, a likeably cocky thief."
"865","tt0033152","10396","16","After they cross paths with the evil Jaffer Conrad Veidt, Justin finds himself blind and Abu is turned into a dog."
"866","tt0033152","10396","17","When it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind Ahmed's Justin's perspective, we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues."
"867","tt0033152","10396","18","In truth, the second half is someway the better, being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature."
"868","tt0033152","10396","19","Three small songs pepper the piece, though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient; I wouldn't classify this as a musical."
"869","tt0033152","10396","20","It's all great fun; Justin and June Duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads, Veidt is the boo hiss villain, and Abu is the youthful, irrepressible robber."
"870","tt0033152","10396","21","It may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s English movies, but once you've sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in."
"871","tt0033152","10396","22","Quite commendable."
"872","tt0033152","10397","1","The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film."
"873","tt0033152","10397","2","Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film."
"874","tt0033152","10397","3","According to the Citadel Film series Book about The Great British Films, adopted son of the United Kingdom Alexander Korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation."
"875","tt0033152","10397","4","But World War II unfortunately caught up with Korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle."
"876","tt0033152","10397","5","Budget costs happen in US films too, only Cecil B."
"877","tt0033152","10397","6","DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there."
"878","tt0033152","10397","7","But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film."
"879","tt0033152","10397","8","Part of the way through the shoot, Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genie in our Grand Canyon."
"880","tt0033152","10397","9","He certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the UK."
"881","tt0033152","10397","10","Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940."
"882","tt0033152","10397","11","The spectacle of the thing earned The Thief Of Bagdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography, best art&set direction for a color film, and best special effects."
"883","tt0033152","10397","12","Only Miklos Rosza's original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category."
"884","tt0033152","10397","13","Korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it's impossible to get bad color pictures from that place."
"885","tt0033152","10397","14","The special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil."
"886","tt0033152","10397","15","The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez."
"887","tt0033152","10397","16","This was Veidt's career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser."
"888","tt0033152","10397","17","Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source."
"889","tt0033152","10397","18","Beggar boy and thief Sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star."
"890","tt0033152","10397","19","Literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features."
"891","tt0033152","10397","20","Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant."
"892","tt0033152","10397","21","Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that."
"893","tt0033152","10397","22","The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today."
"894","tt0033152","10397","23","It's an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it."
"895","tt0033152","10398","1","Although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special."
"896","tt0033152","10398","2","If you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers."
"897","tt0033152","10398","3","I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin cribbed from the film."
"898","tt0033152","10398","4","They loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers."
"899","tt0033152","10398","5","I've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten, which is where a good portion of this film dwells, because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing."
"900","tt0033152","10398","6","Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end."
"901","tt0033152","10398","7","From the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting."
"902","tt0033152","10398","8","It doesn't kill the film, but it does weaken it."
"903","tt0033152","10398","9","Still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even a great movie."
"904","tt0033152","10399","1","This was a favorite of my childhood I can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time."

"910","tt0033152","10399","7","He has no historical frame of reference to speak of eight years old, so Bagdad under the grandson of Haroun al Raschid might as well be Oz under Ozma."
"911","tt0033152","10399","8","I think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring do were perpetrated by the boy thief, and not the grown up king."
"912","tt0033152","10399","9","In fact, if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit, the king is the thief's sidekick, not the hero at all which must be very satisfying to imaginative, adventurous young boys."
"913","tt0033152","10399","10","It's definitely a period piece I suspect that by the time he's eleven or twelve, my son will find it 'corny' or whatever word the next generation will be using by then."
"914","tt0033152","10399","11","The love story is barely one dimensional as a cynical friend commented, ""Why does Ahmad love the Princess."
"915","tt0033152","10399","12","Because the narrative demands it."""
"916","tt0033152","10399","13","The willingness of Abu to put himself in jeopardy repeatedly for the clueless, love struck deposed king is equally improbable."
"917","tt0033152","10399","14","But to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, fifty foot genies and the Temple of the All Seeing Eye would be fatuous in the extreme."
"918","tt0033152","10399","15","The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie's climax is tremendous, as is the final shot of Abu triumphantly flying away on his stolen magic carpet, seeking ""some fun, and adventure at last!"""
"919","tt0033152","10400","1","Probably the finest fantasy film ever made."
"920","tt0033152","10400","2","Sumptuous colour, spectacular sets, incredible, spot on Miklos Rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood."
"921","tt0033152","10400","3","Acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands, but here the poetic dialog is deftly, sensitively spoken the humour is subtle and delightful as well."
"922","tt0033152","10400","4","Doubtless Spielberg and Lucas were enthralled by this one."
"923","tt0033152","10400","5","Along with ""The Four Feathers"" 1939, one of the two finest motion pictures released by Alexander Korda and London Films and one of the finest motion pictures ever made."

"1058","tt0033152","10409","4","This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs."
"1059","tt0033152","10409","5","It doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time."
"1060","tt0033152","10409","6","The production designs are just stunning in this movie."
"1061","tt0033152","10409","7","From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter."
"1062","tt0033152","10409","8","Even though this movie is over 40 years old, the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today's cinema."
"1063","tt0033152","10409","9","The music and songs are also well done."
"1064","tt0033152","10409","10","Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail, ""I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas"" as one of the great musical moments in movies."
"1065","tt0033152","10409","11","I'm usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but I'll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie."
"1066","tt0033152","10409","12","What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don't see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like ""Two Towers"" and ""Silent Hill""."
"1067","tt0033152","10409","13","Way before today's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place."
"1068","tt0033152","10409","14","One of my favorite shots in ""Two Towers"" is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates, the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor, and that's what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie."
"1069","tt0033152","10409","15","They're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they're all just fantasy beings."
"1070","tt0033152","10409","16","It's literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of ""Aladdin"" got their inspiration."
"1071","tt0033152","10409","17","The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet."
"1072","tt0033152","10409","18","It's not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it's nice to know that I'm not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie."
"1073","tt0033152","10409","19","I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it's amazing."
"1074","tt0033152","10409","20","That's a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time."
"1075","tt0033152","10409","21","Sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break."
"1076","tt0033152","10409","22","Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today's standard."
"1077","tt0033152","10409","23","If you ever wanted to see a live action version of ""Aladdin"" then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea."
"1078","tt0033152","10410","1","The Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten all time favorite movies."
"1079","tt0033152","10410","2","It is exciting without gore, it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless."
"1080","tt0033152","10410","3","The casting couldn't have been better."
"1081","tt0033152","10410","4","Rex Ingram made me believe in genies."
"1082","tt0033152","10410","5","And the epitome of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar."
"1083","tt0033152","10410","6","He set the bar very high..."
"1084","tt0033152","10410","7","I watch this movie at least twice a year...and never tire of it."
"1085","tt0033152","10410","8","This film is an adventure for all ages..no one too old to enjoy it."
"1086","tt0033152","10410","9","The Thief of Bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time..."
"1087","tt0033152","10410","10","I was ten years old the first time I saw it and the U.S. was just about to enter WWII."
"1088","tt0033152","10410","11","Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying ""evilness"" a few years later in ""Casablanca."""
"1089","tt0033152","10410","12","And Korda teamed up,I believe, with Justin and Dupree again in ""The Four Feathers""....great film making!"
"1090","tt0033152","10411","1","An utterly beautiful film, one of a handful of I saw when young that entranced me then and still do, in Thief's case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time."
"1091","tt0033152","10411","2","By the '90's my daughter and I had seen it many times on TV but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and Miklos Rozsa's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again."
"1092","tt0033152","10411","3","Idealistic Prince Ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out, but evil Vizier Jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne."
"1093","tt0033152","10411","4","After escaping with a little thief played by Sabu, Ahmad spots a Princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures although apparently not enough for Sabu!"
"1094","tt0033152","10411","5","and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything."
"1095","tt0033152","10411","6","The special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940, but Time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like Superman from 40 years later."
"1096","tt0033152","10411","7","Anyway, if I'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies, flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects!"
"1097","tt0033152","10411","8","Favourite bits: the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when Ahmad reveals himself and Adelaide Hall's suitably romantic song; the stunning colours in the tent in the Land Of Legend  in fact, the stunning colours throughout; Sabu and Rozsa's triumphant but still wistful finale."
"1098","tt0033152","10411","9","Conrad Veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever, this and Casablanca, and then died."
"1099","tt0033152","10411","10","John Justin and June Duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers, both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted, but the parts didn't call for a huge range of emotions: only pure love mattered."
"1100","tt0033152","10411","11","There's a couple of mildly violent images in it, but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100% positive message, it's only a pity that nowadays little kids don't watch this instead of the porn they prefer."
"1101","tt0033152","10411","12","One of my Top 10 film favourites, I can't recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of Time."
"1102","tt0033152","10412","1","The Thief of Bagdad is a treasure."
"1103","tt0033152","10412","2","First and foremost, it is a good story."
"1104","tt0033152","10412","3","Though my four children's primary exposure to this tale, the most famous of the stories of the Arabian Nights, comes from the Disney Corporation, the Thief of Bagdad held their interest to the end."
"1105","tt0033152","10412","4","The story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability."
"1106","tt0033152","10412","5","Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also measures up to any of today's teen actors in appeal, judging from the number of times I heard my oldest daughter say, ""He's c u t e!"""
"1107","tt0033152","10412","6","In 1940, the film won Oscars for cinematography and special effects."
"1108","tt0033152","10412","7","Today, of course, those effects seem very dated ""Look, it's Barbie flying through the air,"" declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying."
"1109","tt0033152","10412","8","Yet they fit into the story well."
"1110","tt0033152","10412","9","The film is, after all, over 60 years old."
"1111","tt0033152","10412","10","The effects fit with the script."
"1112","tt0033152","10412","11","Furthermore, what ones sees in The Thief of Bagdad remained pretty much state of the art for the next twenty five years."
"1113","tt0033152","10412","12","One need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this."
"1114","tt0033152","10412","13","In that, it was quite an achievement."
"1115","tt0033152","10412","14","This qualifies as a family film, though there are a few stabbings near the end."
"1116","tt0033152","10412","15","The acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation."
"1117","tt0033152","10412","16","All in all, a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment, or for the historical value of the effects."
"1118","tt0033152","10412","17","I recommend it."
"1119","tt0033152","10413","1","I grew up with this as my all time favorite film."
"1120","tt0033152","10413","2","The special effects are incredible for the era, and won awards."
"1121","tt0033152","10413","3","I can remember the dialogue as if I'd heard it yesterday."
"1122","tt0033152","10413","4","It is simply a great, timeless adventure."
"1123","tt0033152","10413","5","The music is by Miklos Rosza, who is cinema history's best."
"1124","tt0033152","10413","6","Sabu is the Thief."
"1125","tt0033152","10413","7","Conrad Veidt is the grand villain."
"1126","tt0033152","10413","8","I have a copy within reach, for the next trip down memory lane."
"1127","tt0033152","10413","9","Whoa there!"
"1128","tt0033152","10413","10","Rex Ingram wants out of his genii bottle!"
"1129","tt0033152","10414","1","I first discovered Alexander Korda's 1940 Fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950's on a re issue billed as ""The Wonder Show of the Century!"""
"1130","tt0033152","10414","2","Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program."
"1131","tt0033152","10414","3","The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films."
"1132","tt0033152","10414","4","The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful!"
"1133","tt0033152","10414","5","THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made."
"1134","tt0033152","10414","6","As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in."
"1135","tt0033152","10414","7","True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950's."
"1136","tt0033152","10414","8","Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video."
"1137","tt0033152","10414","9","But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor."
"1138","tt0033152","10414","10","The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it nice, but not as it should be."
"1139","tt0033152","10414","11","NOW comes the M G M DVD 3 Dec 2002 issue."
"1140","tt0033152","10414","12","THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING!!!"
"1141","tt0033152","10414","13","It was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the DVD once, I watched it a second time."
"1142","tt0033152","10414","14","The only ""Extras"" are a Spanish Dubbed version, Sub Titles in both English & Spanish, and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer."
"1143","tt0033152","10414","15","Thank you M G M for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release."
"1144","tt0033152","10414","16","Now, one can only hope that Korda's FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation will soon follow on DVD."
"1145","tt0033152","10415","1","Three flash backs introduce the main characters Abu, Jaffar, and the Princess who will interact with Ahmad; three are the songs, each linked to those same characters."
"1146","tt0033152","10415","2","Three times does Ahmad pronounce the absolute word 'Time', in his declaration of love to the Princess, answering her three questions at their first of three meetings."
"1147","tt0033152","10415","3","So strong is the impression he causes, that the Princess will resist the three attempts by Jaffar to conquer her by three successive ploys: deceit, hypnosis, and memory erasing."
"1148","tt0033152","10415","4","Yet, Jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman: the whip, the power, and the sword."
"1149","tt0033152","10415","5","Three is the number of flying entities: the mechanical horse, the Genie, and the The Genie and the magic carpet."
"1150","tt0033152","10415","6","The Genie offers three wishes to Abu at their first of three encounters; three times does the Genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges, and three are his considerations about human frailty, before he departs."
"1151","tt0033152","10415","7","Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn armed guards, giant spider, and giant octopus."
"1152","tt0033152","10415","8","Three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu the future, the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save Ahmad and the Princess, and the bow and arrow to execute Jaffar."
"1153","tt0033152","10415","9","There's magic in the number three, and there is magic in this movie."
"1154","tt0033152","10416","1","Like the Arabian Nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there's plot, plot and more plot: it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life, then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man's present, where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come."
"1155","tt0033152","10416","2","It must be admitted that the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first."
"1156","tt0033152","10416","3","Like the Arabian Nights it tries to cram as many Middle Eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work."
"1157","tt0033152","10416","4","A freed genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded marketplace, a wicked vizier, jewels ..."
"1158","tt0033152","10416","5","I don't know why it all works, but it does."
"1159","tt0033152","10416","6","Everything is just so beautiful."
"1160","tt0033152","10416","7","The sets are beautiful."
"1161","tt0033152","10416","8","June Duprez is beautiful."
"1162","tt0033152","10416","9","Rozsa's score is especially beautiful."
"1163","tt0033152","10416","10","As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he's being Hungarian in a Persian way."
"1164","tt0033152","10417","1","""The Thief of Bagdad"" is impressive in the shape of the evil magician Jaffar Conrad Veidt."
"1165","tt0033152","10417","2","He plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young King Ahmad, and a gorgeous princess from her father..."
"1166","tt0033152","10417","3","He falls victim in the end, as all tyrants do in books and legends to love and of the common man whom he ignored, here embodied by the little thief Sabu."
"1167","tt0033152","10417","4","The armies of good and evil, black and white, are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms..."
"1168","tt0033152","10417","5","The script is poetic, simply and very beautiful..."
"1169","tt0033152","10417","6","The costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds, attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror..."
"1170","tt0033152","10417","7","The radiant hero wears white turbans and robes, and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues..."
"1171","tt0033152","10417","8","For spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before, while through its use of color, it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before..."
"1172","tt0033152","10417","9","With flying carpet and flying white horse, with a giant genie excellently played by Rex Ingram, with evil wizards, and with the good acting of Sabu and Veidt, ""The Thief of Bagdad"" captures the quality and true atmosphere of the Arabian Nights..."
"1173","tt0033152","10417","10","The 1940 version remains the screen's finest fairy tale!"
"1174","tt0033152","10418","1","The story of the boy thief of Bagdad as it was once spelled has attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, who starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first, silent, rendering of ""Thief of Bagdad,"" to less imposing, more recent attempts."
"1175","tt0033152","10418","2","The best, however, remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling, magical panoply of top quality special effects."
"1176","tt0033152","10418","3","Those effects still work their charm."
"1177","tt0033152","10418","4","No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Sabu as the boy thief, Abu, John Justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, Jaffar, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt."
"1178","tt0033152","10418","5","The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram."
"1179","tt0033152","10418","6","Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent, he and the boy, Abu, suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates."
"1180","tt0033152","10418","7","Ahmad is rendered blind and Abu becomes a lovable mutt."
"1181","tt0033152","10418","8","Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work."
"1182","tt0033152","10418","9","Two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado like black swirl: Lawrence W."
"1183","tt0033152","10418","10","Butler and Tom Howard."
"1184","tt0033152","10418","11","Howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film."
"1185","tt0033152","10418","12","Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry."
"1186","tt0033152","10418","13","Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting."
"1187","tt0033152","10418","14","Justin's Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses."
"1188","tt0033152","10418","15","Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good."
"1189","tt0033152","10418","16","For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind."
"1190","tt0033152","10418","17","Still, I don't think anyone under eight ought to see ""Thief of Bagdad."""
"1191","tt0033152","10418","18","This film makes periodic appearances on TV but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present."
"1192","tt0033152","10418","19","It was great to see computer besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them."""
"1193","tt0033152","10418","20","Thief of Bagdad"" is a pre war Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases."
"1194","tt0033152","10418","21","This is one of the best of its kind.9/10."
"1195","tt0037514","4455","1","Though I liked On the Town better I really liked it."
"1196","tt0037514","4455","2","I'm a new comer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly."
"1197","tt0037514","4455","3","Though I had heard of them I had never seen anything with them in it until recently."
"1198","tt0037514","4455","4","The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain that made me a fan of Gene's."
"1199","tt0037514","4455","5","I think that is better too."
"1200","tt0037514","4455","6","But I thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it's an awesome movie and I love it."
"1201","tt0037514","4455","7","Frank and Gene make a good team."
"1202","tt0037514","4455","8","I have yet to see them together in Take me out to the Ballgame."
"1203","tt0037514","4455","9","But I'm sticking to my guns bu saying that I really enjoyed it, and that I love it!"
"1204","tt0037514","4456","1","Lots of singing and dancing in this one, especially by Gene Kelly."
"1205","tt0037514","4456","2","Two sailors go on liberty to see if they can find love and romance."
"1206","tt0037514","4456","3","They meet up with a woman who is trying to break into show business."
"1207","tt0037514","4456","4","Musical lovers only."
"1208","tt0037514","4457","1","Yes, this is one of the great musical movies I grew up with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson."
"1209","tt0037514","4457","2","The music and dancing is superb."
"1210","tt0037514","4457","3","I understand Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is quite unique for the time."
"1211","tt0037514","4457","4","Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra."
"1212","tt0037514","4457","5","She is one of Hollywood's great underrated stars."
"1213","tt0037514","4457","6","I saw this again on A&E TV and as well have it in my old VCR tapes."
"1214","tt0037514","4457","7","Never get tired of these old musicals."
"1215","tt0037514","4457","8","Whatever happened to Hollywood.."
"1216","tt0037514","4458","1","This has some excellent spots but the length of the film can not sustain the wafer thin plot."
"1217","tt0037514","4458","2","It is another sailors on leave film, zippier than Astaire's 'Follow the Fleet' but not as good as 'On The Town'."
"1218","tt0037514","4458","3","Kathryn Grayson is bland but Kelly and Sinatra work well together."
"1219","tt0037514","4458","4","Their 'If you Knew Susie' number is hilarious as they make up the song as they sing it."
"1220","tt0037514","4458","5","'I Begged Her' is also fun with Sinatra showing how adept he was at hoofing."
"1221","tt0037514","4458","6","Sinatra's solo songs are dull and seem to be inserted to show off his singing rather than as part of the story."
"1222","tt0037514","4458","7","Fortunately there are accomplished supporting actors like Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and an unlikely but impertubable Jose Iturbi as himself, to keep one watching."
"1223","tt0037514","4458","8","Kelly is the star of the film, although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children, which Astaire never did."
"1224","tt0037514","4458","9","Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and latches on to the Kelly character."
"1225","tt0037514","4458","10","He also visit a school resulting in him telling the children a fictitious story of his life in the Pomeranian !"
"1226","tt0037514","4458","11","navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated Jerry Mouse."
"1227","tt0037514","4458","12","In another scene he dances a charming Mexican Hat Dance with a sublimely grave faced little girl, Sharon McManus, that is entrancing and sweet."
"1228","tt0037514","4458","13","Very pleasant then but a bit too long."
"1229","tt0037514","4458","14","A taster of better musicals to come."
"1230","tt0037514","4459","1","For such films like `Anchors Aweigh', few have been bestowed with as many Academy Award accolades in a warm up for happy hour."
"1231","tt0037514","4459","2","Either 1945 was a beleaguered year for good film or they were still suffering advance shock by Billy Wilder's `The Lost Weekend' that they wrote anything starting with A on the ballot for best picture to please the still musical picture faithful public."
"1232","tt0037514","4459","3","Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in `Singin' in the Rain', then there had to be something wrong with the behind the scenes rigging systems at MGM."
"1233","tt0037514","4459","4","Of course, the studio is on its best behaviour during this much lauded tour of the great studios and of Hollywood itself, handy for those stuck on the other side of the world."
"1234","tt0037514","4459","5","Yet a sailor suit musical with the brilliant talents of Gene and Frank Sinatra is certainly an enjoyable farce, despite the need for more people to yawn at the previews for the musical so today's audiences wouldn't be slapped with an unnecessary runtime."
"1235","tt0037514","4459","6","There have been many longer pieces before and since, but in this case all of the charming Kathryn Grayson's scenes could have been eliminated."
"1236","tt0037514","4459","7","Until the viewing of `Kiss Me Kate' it may have been necessary non opera enthusiasts to watch any of her films with remote control in hand."
"1237","tt0037514","4459","8","If there was a need to practice picking up women for 1949's `On the Town', then perhaps the shore leave lucky sailors did not have to promise an audition with Jose Iturbi and strike up the piano for a whole hearted `Susie' rendition."
"1238","tt0037514","4459","9","Few are lucky to get a screen test at the golden studios of MGM."
"1239","tt0037514","4459","10","Then few are even luckier to be attended to."
"1240","tt0037514","4459","11","There are no regrets to be had about the successful screen tests of Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson, but it makes the continual non opera enthusiast hope for the eventual pink slip to be handed out to both."
"1241","tt0037514","4459","12","But for all, the star talents are good shape and an above average score thrown in with a slight, but fun great navy story intertwined with young ambitious navy boys good for late bursts of wartime morale, makes `Anchors' at least doesn't question picking the wrong MGM film."
"1242","tt0037514","4459","13","The direction holds up as the cast carries the story in lovely colour cinematography."
"1243","tt0037514","4459","14","Whenever anyone bursts into music or song, the film makes for a joyous occasion."
"1244","tt0037514","4459","15","The natural highlight of the film is Gene Kelly's cartoon adventures in a fantasyland, climaxing in a brilliant dance with Jerry the mouse."
"1245","tt0037514","4459","16","This is a well deserved masterpiece number of Kelly's career, and it's nice to know he thought of it before Fred Astaire started taking to dancing on walls and ceilings."
"1246","tt0037514","4459","17","It's not exactly sitting down to a triple flavour, rainbow sprinkled, chocolate wafer, cream and cherry and banana split sundae, but it is a square solid lump of sugar that somehow eventually melts in your mouth and despite the guilt, is still a pleasant feeling."
"1247","tt0037514","4459","18","Rating: 7/10"
"1248","tt0037514","4460","1","Ah, a Kelly/Sinatra sailor suit musical."
"1249","tt0037514","4460","2","So familiar, right."
"1250","tt0037514","4460","3","Yes, but this isn't the one you usually hear about."
"1251","tt0037514","4460","4","On The Town's that a way."
"1252","tt0037514","4460","5","But if you stick around, you might learn something."
"1253","tt0037514","4460","6","Okay, probably not."
"1254","tt0037514","4460","7","Anyway, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a three or four day leave."
"1255","tt0037514","4460","8","Joe is the ""Sea Wolf"" and Clarence, the bookish type, begs Joe to get him a ""dame""."
"1256","tt0037514","4460","9","Now, after they're picked up by the coppers they get little Donald home."
"1257","tt0037514","4460","10","That's where they meet Susie, that temptress, that jezebel."
"1258","tt0037514","4460","11","Just kidding!"
"1259","tt0037514","4460","12","Clarence falls in love with her."
"1260","tt0037514","4460","13","At least he thinks he does."
"1261","tt0037514","4460","14","Is he right."
"1262","tt0037514","4460","15","Or is he a moron."
"1263","tt0037514","4460","16","Or is he just misguided by society."
"1264","tt0037514","4460","17","Find out all this and more when you watch trumpet fanfare ANCHORS AWEIGH!"
"1265","tt0037514","4460","18","P.S."
"1266","tt0037514","4460","19","If you want to see Kathryn Grayson be anything but sickeningly sweet, try Kiss Me Kate 1953."
"1267","tt0037514","4461","1","I really liked this movie."
"1268","tt0037514","4461","2","I have seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best."
"1269","tt0037514","4461","3","I would actually put it above his more famous American in Paris."
"1270","tt0037514","4461","4","Sometimes it seems the story gets lost in Gene Kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this movie."
"1271","tt0037514","4461","5","It is definitely worth renting."
"1272","tt0037514","4462","1","One of the first of the best musicals, Anchors Aweigh features several memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly dancing with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dancing with 7 year old Sharon McManus, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi playing piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi conducting, and much more."
"1273","tt0037514","4462","2","The Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath, through transparent keys, and Grayson singing, seen through the finder of another camera."
"1274","tt0037514","4462","3","The plot is thin, but you get involved from Kelly's & Sinatra's enthusiasm."
"1275","tt0037514","4462","4","Sailor's on leave, they have to take home a runaway boy Dean Stockwell and Sinatra falls for his aunt."
"1276","tt0037514","4462","5","To set him up with the aunt Grayson, Kelly suggests that Sinatra can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi."
"1277","tt0037514","4462","6","But Sinatra's young and naive in this one, and in his own sung words falls in love too fast."
"1278","tt0037514","4462","7","While they're trying to contact Iturbi, who's never available, he starts to fall for another girl Barbara Britton; but Kelly's now falling love with Grayson."
"1279","tt0037514","4462","8","Anchors Aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live action / cartoon sequence with Tom and Jerry, but there's a lot more here that's worth a look."
"1280","tt0037514","4462","9","I'm giving it nine stars because, while it's not quite as good as the best musicals Singin' In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma it is one of the first of their class of Technicolor big productions perhaps Meet Me In St."
"1281","tt0037514","4462","10","Louis was the first, and better than most others."
"1282","tt0037514","4463","1","A recent viewing of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT has given me the urge to watch many of the classic MGM musicals from the forties and fifties."
"1283","tt0037514","4463","2","ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a lesser film than ON THE TOWN."
"1284","tt0037514","4463","3","The songs aren't as good, nor is the chemistry between the characters."
"1285","tt0037514","4463","4","But the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites, such as Tchaikovsky."
"1286","tt0037514","4463","5","And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top, and then running down the steps, while dozens of pianists play on the piano, is the best scene in the film, even though the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous."
"1287","tt0037514","4463","6","Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing."
"1288","tt0037514","4463","7","Sinatra then croons, ""I Fall in Love Too Easily,"" before having his epiphany about whom he loves."
"1289","tt0037514","4463","8","The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution free air Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, let alone the mid 1940s.!, and the piano music is absolutely glorious."
"1290","tt0037514","4463","9","MGM certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these."
"1291","tt0037514","4464","1","Incredibly ARTISTIC NOBODY COULD MAKE THEM NOW I THINK.It seem to be perfect the biggest and the greatest musical ever made listen to the beautiful songs the are quite poetry."
"1292","tt0037514","4464","2","I'M Italian AND ADMIRED BY American MUSICAL. why can't you do something like that now."
"1293","tt0037514","4464","3","American were the best and for that i absolutely show my devotion to you with this movie.there are words to describes the perfection of this movie. all of a sudden my heart sings, what makes the sunset. i fall in love to easily,jealousy...and the scene with Tom and Jerry. the greatest without reserve. if you you doesn't know your eyes are not open my friends you must see it and appreciate...wake up!"
"1294","tt0037514","4465","1","ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but I wouldn't rate it up there with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON."
"1295","tt0037514","4465","2","This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared in together."
"1296","tt0037514","4465","3","Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors on leave in Hollywood who befriend a young boy Dean Stockwellwho introduces them to his attractive young aunt Kathryn Grayson a struggling actress who is working as an extra at MGM."
"1297","tt0037514","4465","4","Though both guys are initially attracted to Grayson, she eventually voices a preference to Joe but Clarence later hooks up with a waitress Pamela Brittonwho, he learns is from his hometown of Brooklyn."
"1298","tt0037514","4465","5","The paper thin plot leaves room for several great musical numbers including ""We Hate to Leave"", Joe and Clarence's lament to their fellow sailors as they're leaving the ship; Grayson's torrid rendition of ""Jalousie""; Sinatra's dreamy rendition of ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" a number which is sadly deleted from some prints of this film, and ""The Worry Song"", a fantasy dance that Kelly does with animated Jerry the Mouse from Tom and Jerry fame."
"1299","tt0037514","4465","6","Kelly also does a sort of Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet which rivals his Pirate's Ballet in the later THE PIRATE."
"1300","tt0037514","4465","7","Kelly is in peak form here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Sinatra's endearingly shy character here is undeniably sexy."
"1301","tt0037514","4465","8","An entertaining diversion for fans of the MGM musical factory."
"1302","tt0037514","4466","1","""Anchors Aweigh"" is the product of the classic MGM musical production unit, and on the whole the film is every enjoyable  good music by Jule Styne and others, excellent dancing by Gene Kelly and even a passable job by Frank Sinatra, and a funny well paced script."
"1303","tt0037514","4466","2","The only major element I would criticize would be the casting of Kathryn Grayson, whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudo operatic warbling from the petite Miss."
"1304","tt0037514","4466","3","Kelly plays a naval serviceman named Joseph Brady, a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose Valentino charms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middle American name of Clarence Sinatra."
"1305","tt0037514","4466","4","Upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving Clarence's life, Joe reluctantly agrees to help Clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life."
"1306","tt0037514","4466","5","They are drafted by a policeman Rags Ragland, who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy Dean Stockwell who wants to join the Navy into returning home to ""Aunt Susan"" Grayson."
"1307","tt0037514","4466","6","At first it is Clarence who is interested in wooing ""Aunt Susan"" but eventually Kelly's character emerges as the more likely candidate."
"1308","tt0037514","4466","7","There are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to Kelly's more famous work in films like ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""American in Paris""."
"1309","tt0037514","4466","8","The closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with Kelly's character in a fantasy sequence dancing with Jerry, the mouse from ""Tom and Jerry"" although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse."
"1310","tt0037514","4466","9","It's a startling sequence for its time but doesn't have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time."
"1311","tt0037514","4466","10","I actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation, where Kelly was using semi balletic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of ""Alice in Wonderland""."
"1312","tt0037514","4466","11","Eventually the characters find their way to Susan's favorite bar, a somewhat sanitized Mexican restaurant/bar in Tijuana."
"1313","tt0037514","4466","12","There the patrons happily allow Ms."
"1314","tt0037514","4466","13","Grayson to chirp her arias with abandon, and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that Clarence and Joe have extended for her to sing with their ""friend"" Jose Iturbi playing himself with a light humorous touch."
"1315","tt0037514","4466","14","Of course they've never met their ""friend"" Iturbi and they spend much of the film's length trying to reach him in an amusing scene Sinatra's character meets Iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career, sneaking into the studio and the Hollywood Bowl, where Iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players  you haven't seen anything like this outside of ""1000 Fingers of Dr."
"1316","tt0037514","4466","15","T""."
"1317","tt0037514","4466","16","Iturbi himself is a kind of a god figure in the story  he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine."
"1318","tt0037514","4466","17","Everyone is 100% sure that as soon as Mr."
"1319","tt0037514","4466","18","Iturbi so much as hears Ms."
"1320","tt0037514","4466","19","Grayson, her operatic career will be a reality."
"1321","tt0037514","4466","20","The 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure  a lot of the film's charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very down to earth ""real"" mannerisms of the maestro."
"1322","tt0037514","4466","21","And speaking of Iturbi's contributions to the film, he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of ""Donkey Serenade""."
"1323","tt0037514","4466","22","When all is said and done, this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss."
"1324","tt0037514","4466","23","The majority of the music was written for this film, a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other Kelly opuses like ""Rain"" and ""American""."
"1325","tt0037514","4466","24","Kelly is still at his early peak, adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character."
"1326","tt0037514","4466","25","Sinatra's voice was never in better form and he rarely had better songs to sing."
"1327","tt0037514","4466","26","Stockwell is a charming addition to the clan, and Grayson's character is endearing when she isn't posturing on stage."
"1328","tt0037514","4466","27","Iturbi adds that well grounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classic era MGM musical."
"1329","tt0037514","4466","28","This is one of the better ones."
"1330","tt0037514","4467","1","Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson."
"1331","tt0037514","4467","2","The film won and Oscar for George E."
"1332","tt0037514","4467","3","Stoll's score, and it garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Son nomination for ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" sung by Sinatra."
"1333","tt0037514","4467","4","It was a cute story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself."
"1334","tt0037514","4467","5","The lovely Grayson The Toast of New Orleans dazzled us with her singing, and we had a lot of great songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the artistry of pianist conductor José Iturbi."
"1335","tt0037514","4467","6","A classic Hollywood music from an era gone by."
"1336","tt0037514","4468","1","Two sailors are on leave ladies man Joseph Brady Gene Kelly and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle Frank Sinatra."
"1337","tt0037514","4468","2","They meet beautiful Susan Abbott Kathryn Grayson and both fall in love with her."
"1338","tt0037514","4468","3","There's more but you've probably guessed it."
"1339","tt0037514","4468","4","The story even for a 1940s musical is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome gets annoying pretty quick."
"1340","tt0037514","4468","5","Also this movie is far too long."
"1341","tt0037514","4468","6","It's 140 minutes and that's way too much for such a silly story."
"1342","tt0037514","4468","7","There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra."
"1343","tt0037514","4468","8","Still this is worth catching."
"1344","tt0037514","4468","9","When Kelly is dancing or Sinatra or Grayson are singing this becomes magical."
"1345","tt0037514","4468","10","None of the songs are particularly memorable but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won't care."
"1346","tt0037514","4468","11","It's shot in rich Technicolor with all the gloss MGM had."
"1347","tt0037514","4468","12","The acting is OK Kelly is fine although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it and Sinatra is just great although seeing HIM as a shy guy was pushing it too!."
"1348","tt0037514","4468","13","Grayson is given nothing to do but she's incredibly beautiful to look at."
"1349","tt0037514","4468","14","Some shots of her literally took my breath away!"
"1350","tt0037514","4468","15","There are plenty of highlights here: Sinatra and Kelly's big dancing and singing number; Sinatra singing anything; Grayson's two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry an animated mouse!"
"1351","tt0037514","4468","16","Tom does a funny cameo too."
"1352","tt0037514","4468","17","Also there's little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he's in."
"1353","tt0037514","4468","18","So it's too long and the plot just doesn't hold up but it's still worth catching."
"1354","tt0037514","4468","19","This was a huge hit in its day."
"1355","tt0037514","4469","1","Usually musicals in the 1940's were of a set formula and if you studied films you know what I'm talking about a certain running lenghth, very ""showy"" performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc."
"1356","tt0037514","4469","2","THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT and light years better and well worth it's nomination for best picture of the year 1945 although had no chance of beating the eventual winner Lost Weekend."
"1357","tt0037514","4469","3","Gene Kelly was probably in the best form of his career yes I know about ""American in Paris"" and ""Singing in the Rain""."
"1358","tt0037514","4469","4","This one is different."
"1359","tt0037514","4469","5","He really gets into his character of a ""sea wolf"" thinking at first that ""picking up any girl while on leave"" is nothing more than a lark."
"1360","tt0037514","4469","6","And if you had to make up a ""story"" to get her so be it until."
"1361","tt0037514","4469","7","Sort of like the Music Man when he gets ""his foot caught in the door""."
"1362","tt0037514","4469","8","The eventual hilarity of the film stems mostly from his and his new pal Sinatra's attempt to make the ""story"" good in order to ""get the girl"" that he REALLY and unexpectedly falls in love with."
"1363","tt0037514","4469","9","You are going to have to see the movie to see what I mean."
"1364","tt0037514","4469","10","Besides that there are so many other elements of great film in this one, it's a classic buddy story, nostalgia to a time when WWII was almost over the war ended about a month after the films release, a realization that a guy that always laughed at life can find out that he really is a great human being, great songs and probably a few other elements of classic film making that I can't think of right now."
"1365","tt0037514","4469","11","Why not a 10."
"1366","tt0037514","4469","12","Near the end at nearly 2 1/2 hours starts to feel a bit long."
"1367","tt0037514","4469","13","There is a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now."
"1368","tt0037514","4469","14","But overall, this ones a definite winner on every level."
"1369","tt0037514","4470","1","Similar to ""On the Town,"" this musical about sailors on shore leave falls short of the later classic in terms of pacing and the quality of the songs, but it has its own charms."
"1370","tt0037514","4470","2","Kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with Jerry the cartoon mouse of ""Tom and Jerry"" fame, one with a little girl, and a fantasy sequence where he is a Spanish lover determined to reach his lady on a high balcony."
"1371","tt0037514","4470","3","Sinatra, playing Kelly's shy, inexperienced buddy, and Grayson, the woman who serves as the love interest for both men, do most of the singing."
"1372","tt0037514","4470","4","Iturbi provides some fine piano playing."
"1373","tt0037514","4470","5","At nearly two and half hours, it is a bit too long for a light musical but it doesn't drag."
"1374","tt0037514","4471","1","Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, and Jose Iturbi star in ""Anchors Aweigh,"" directed by George Sidney."
"1375","tt0037514","4471","2","Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two navy guys on leave in Hollywood."
"1376","tt0037514","4471","3","They meet a little boy Dean Stockwell and on taking him home, they meet his aunt Grayson."
"1377","tt0037514","4471","4","Clarence falls for her."
"1378","tt0037514","4471","5","She wants an audition for Jose Iturbi."
"1379","tt0037514","4471","6","They try to help, but there's a mix up."
"1380","tt0037514","4471","7","This is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra."
"1381","tt0037514","4471","8","Kelly gets to dance with Jerry the Mouse in a delightful sequence."
"1382","tt0037514","4471","9","Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings."
"1383","tt0037514","4471","10","Not one of my favorite voices, but she does well."
"1384","tt0037514","4471","11","Iturbi's piano work is beautiful."
"1385","tt0037514","4471","12","Sinatra gets to show his versatility and why the girls swooned over him, with those big blue eyes and boyish face."
"1386","tt0037514","4471","13","For Kelly, this was a major break for him at MGM.Wonderful movie, very buoyant."
"1387","tt0037514","4472","1","Right from the start you see that ""Anchors Aweigh"" is a great comedy."
"1388","tt0037514","4472","2","Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team!"
"1389","tt0037514","4472","3","The songs they sing together are pure entertainment."
"1390","tt0037514","4472","4","Kathryn Grayson is gorgeous and really sweet."
"1391","tt0037514","4472","5","Dean Stockwell is the cutiest child actor I've never seen."
"1392","tt0037514","4472","6","If you are fond of piano, you'll be amazed by José Iturbi."
"1393","tt0037514","4472","7","This movie was the first one to combine animation with real actors and it did that wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number."
"1394","tt0037514","4472","8","Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest movies."
"1395","tt0037514","4473","1","Although in my opinion this is one of the lesser musicals of stars Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly, Kathryn Grayson and director George Sidney, a lesser musical featuring anyone from that line up is nothing to sneeze at, and in conjunction, the line up makes Anchors Aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws."
"1396","tt0037514","4473","2","Sinatra and Kelly are Clarence Doolittle and Joseph Brady, respectively, two Navy men."
"1397","tt0037514","4473","3","As the film begins, they're just pulling in to the Los Angeles area for some much needed leave."
"1398","tt0037514","4473","4","Brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named Lola."
"1399","tt0037514","4473","5","Doolittle is still a bit wet behind the ears, appropriately enough, and seeks advice on women from Brady in private publicly, scriptwriter Isobel Lennart and Sidney have all of the Navy men comically exaggerating their finesse with women to each other."
"1400","tt0037514","4473","6","Brady promises to help get Doolittle hooked up, but primarily because Doolittle won't leave him alone otherwise."
"1401","tt0037514","4473","7","A kink is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the Navy."
"1402","tt0037514","4473","8","He won't give the police any information about who he is or where he lives."
"1403","tt0037514","4473","9","Brady helps and he and Doolittle end up taking the boy back home."
"1404","tt0037514","4473","10","When the boy's guardian, Susan Abbott Grayson, finally shows up, Doolittle goes gaga for her."
"1405","tt0037514","4473","11","Brady tries to convince him to forget about her; Brady just wants to get back to Lola."
"1406","tt0037514","4473","12","But they keep getting coaxed back to Abbott's home, and eventually something of a love triangle forms."
"1407","tt0037514","4473","13","Things become more complicated when Brady lies about Doolittle knowing a famous musician, Jose Iturbi, who is in residence at a film studio, and claims that Doolittle has set up an audition for Abbott, who is a singer and actress, in front of Iturbi."
"1408","tt0037514","4473","14","Because of the story, the music is a strange combination of militaristic music because of the Navy premise, obviously, Broadway pop what the stars tend to sing in more informal settings, opera what Abbott's character excels at, Liberace like popular classical what Iturbi did, and Mexican music because Abbott frequents a Mexican restaurant in a Mexican section of L.A."
"1409","tt0037514","4473","15","The combination doesn't work as well as it could."
"1410","tt0037514","4473","16","Plenty of the songs are good, and everyone involved is certainly talented as a singer or musician, but the genre hopping tends to lose coherence."
"1411","tt0037514","4473","17","Worse, there are a couple showcases for Iturbi, who was apparently a big star at the time, that effectively bring the plot to a halt and that seem more than a bit hokey at this point in time."
"1412","tt0037514","4473","18","I just watched another film that happened to have outstanding music, Robert Altman's Kansas City 1996, but that misguidedly stopped the plot to periodically turn into a concert film."
"1413","tt0037514","4473","19","Anchors Aweigh takes a similar tactic."
"1414","tt0037514","4473","20","Yes, this is a musical, but there's a difference between songs that propel and are integral to the plot and concert showcases that seem like contractual obligation material."
"1415","tt0037514","4473","21","There are also some plot problems."
"1416","tt0037514","4473","22","It's not very well established why Brady is so against Doolittle's pursuit of Abbott."
"1417","tt0037514","4473","23","We can guess that Brady thinks Doolittle shouldn't become involved with someone who has to take care of a kid, and who seems relatively ""proper"" and traditional, but on the other hand, Brady can tell that Doolittle doesn't have the same womanizing disposition that Brady admits of himself."
"1418","tt0037514","4473","24","Abbott seems like a good fit for Doolittle, and furthermore, Lennart works hard to establish that Brady just wants to get Doolittle out of his hair and get on with meeting Lola it seems that Brady's character should be quickly pawning Doolittle off on any candidate, whether she's a good fit or not."
"1419","tt0037514","4473","25","This might seem like a minor detail, but it's actually the hinge for about a third to half of the plot."
"1420","tt0037514","4473","26","The story also seems a bit drawn out."
"1421","tt0037514","4473","27","Length is a problem."
"1422","tt0037514","4473","28","Anchors Aweigh, clocking in at roughly two hours and twenty minutes, should have been cut down by at least a half hour."
"1423","tt0037514","4473","29","The above surely sounds like I'm complaining about the film too much to justify an 8."
"1424","tt0037514","4473","30","I just wanted to stress what I see as flaws, because the conventional wisdom on Anchors Aweigh is much closer to the idea that it has no flaws."
"1425","tt0037514","4473","31","Sinatra, Kelly and Grayson are certainly charismatic, separately and together."
"1426","tt0037514","4473","32","They turn in good, interesting performances."
"1427","tt0037514","4473","33","Sinatra looks and acts much younger than his actual age of 29  30 while shooting."
"1428","tt0037514","4473","34","He plays an unusually naïve, virginal character completely different than most of the roles he would take later, and different than his public image as a crooner."
"1429","tt0037514","4473","35","For Kelly, this was his breakthrough film, and rightfully so."
"1430","tt0037514","4473","36","His choreography is varied and impressive, as is his acting."
"1431","tt0037514","4473","37","Grayson is charming, her performance is sophisticatedly understated, and she's simply gorgeous."
"1432","tt0037514","4473","38","All of this helps override the flaws with the script and the drawn out pacing."
"1433","tt0037514","4473","39","And there's even a very interesting element that probably only arises because Sidney was allowed to sprawl over a large variety of moods the infamous Kelly dance with Jerry the Mouse of ""Tom and Jerry"" fame in an extended fantasy sequence."
"1434","tt0037514","4473","40","This is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation, and it is extremely well done and enjoyable as long as you're a fan of fantasy."
"1435","tt0037514","4473","41","The fantasy sequences tend to be the best of the film."
"1436","tt0037514","4473","42","Matched in excellence to the dance with Jerry the Mouse is a long song and dance number featuring Kelly and Grayson, where Brady is imagining Abbott in a scene from a period film while he woos her, having to resort to acrobatic stunts to reach her physically as she stands on a high balcony."
"1437","tt0037514","4473","43","As uneven and flawed as the film is, it is largely successful and entertaining to watch."
"1438","tt0037514","4473","44","Fans of classic musicals certainly shouldn't miss Anchors Aweigh, and neither should Sinatra fans, who'll get quite a kick out of his character."
"1439","tt0037514","4474","1","This film like Astaire's ROYAL WEDDING which was shown after it on Turner Classic Network last night is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in Gene Kelly's record: Like Fred Astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a room's walls and ceiling, this film had Gene Kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with Jerry Mouse."
"1440","tt0037514","4474","2","The sequence is nicely done."
"1441","tt0037514","4474","3","What is forgotten is that Kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to Dean Stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day, and sets the stage for the sequence by having Stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background."
"1442","tt0037514","4474","4","Kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white ""Pomeranian"" navy uniform with blue stripes on it."
"1443","tt0037514","4474","5","Jerry Mouse does more than dance with Gene."
"1444","tt0037514","4474","6","He actually talks a first that he did not repeat for many decades."
"1445","tt0037514","4474","7","He also finally puts Tom Cat into his proper place Tom briefly appears as King Jerry's butler, trying to cheer him with a platter of cheeses."
"1446","tt0037514","4474","8","But the sequence of the cartoon with Kelly took about seven minutes of the movie."
"1447","tt0037514","4474","9","Far more of this peculiar film is taken up with Kelly's story of the lost four day furlough in Hollywood, and how Kelly ends up meeting Katherine Grayson and with Frank Sinatra stalking Jose Iturbi at the MGM film studio, the Hollywood Bowl, and Iturbi's own home."
"1448","tt0037514","4474","10","Except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbing."
"1449","tt0037514","4474","11","Kelly has saved Sinatra's life in the Pacific, and is getting a medal as a result."
"1450","tt0037514","4474","12","They are both among the crewmen back in California who are getting a four day leave."
"1451","tt0037514","4474","13","But the script writers to propel what would be a short film Kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one ""Lola"", an unseen good time girl in Hollywood saddle Gene with Frank."
"1452","tt0037514","4474","14","It seems Frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie factories particularly musical comedies who are socially underdeveloped and in need of ""instruction"" about meeting girls or guys if the characters are women."
"1453","tt0037514","4474","15","Frank insists that Gene help ""teach him"" how to get a girl."
"1454","tt0037514","4474","16","Just then a policeman takes them to headquarters to help the cops with a little boy Stockwell who insists on joining the navy and won't give the cops his real name and address."
"1455","tt0037514","4474","17","When a protesting Kelly is able to get this information out of Stockwell by asking him some straight questions which the cops could not ask, they insist Kelly take the boy home to his aunt Grayson."
"1456","tt0037514","4474","18","Still protesting, Kelly gets saddled with increasingly complicated problems mostly due to Sinatra's simplistic soul view of things."
"1457","tt0037514","4474","19","He misses seeing Lola the next day by sleeping late Sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up."
"1458","tt0037514","4474","20","He keeps getting dragged back to Grayson's house, as Sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself, but needs Kelly to train him in love making."
"1459","tt0037514","4474","21","I suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of ANCHORS AWEIGH, but I find this kind of story irritating."
"1460","tt0037514","4474","22","While the singing and dancing and concert music of Kelly, Sinatra, Grayson, and Iturbi are first rate, it is annoying to have to take the idiocies of someone like Sinatra's character seriously."
"1461","tt0037514","4474","23","In the real world Kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day furlough what right has he to insist as Sinatra does that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date."
"1462","tt0037514","4474","24","That kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsense."
"1463","tt0037514","4474","25","The stalking of Iturbi is likewise annoying."
"1464","tt0037514","4474","26","Kelly tries to get Grayson to like Sinatra when he says Sinatra can get her a meeting with Jose Iturbi to audition her singing ability."
"1465","tt0037514","4474","27","For much of the rest of the picture Sinatra and Kelly try to do that, and keep floundering at one point for no really good reason Grayson herself ruins Kelly's attempt to get an interview at MGM with Iturbi."
"1466","tt0037514","4474","28","It is only sheer luck that Iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed Grayson that she does give him an audition of her talent."
"1467","tt0037514","4474","29","Kelly, by the way, ends up with Grayson."
"1468","tt0037514","4474","30","Sinatra's conscience at not being able to help her see Iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her but not pulling Kelly into it, oddly enough and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress Pamela Britton from his native Brooklyn."
"1469","tt0037514","4474","31","And naturally, without any assistance from Kelly, Sinatra and Britton fall in love."
"1470","tt0037514","4474","32","Ah,""consistency""!"
"1471","tt0037514","4474","33","Thy name is not ""screenwriting"" necessarily!"
"1472","tt0037514","4475","1","The United States was still fighting World War II the movie was released in between VE day and VJ day."
"1473","tt0037514","4475","2","Any studio worth its salt was either making fighting movies where fearless American soldiers beat the enemy, or Americans in general were singing and dancing."
"1474","tt0037514","4475","3","Technicolor Musicals were what America thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed."
"1475","tt0037514","4475","4","Most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time til the next musical number!"
"1476","tt0037514","4475","5","I get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970."
"1477","tt0037514","4475","6","Depressing how quickly we forget."
"1478","tt0037514","4475","7","This film could've been called ""The Search for Jose Iturbi"" but now everyone wonders why."
"1479","tt0037514","4475","8","Allow me to explain."
"1480","tt0037514","4475","9","From 1929 his arrival in America until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the finest pianists to grace a concert stage."
"1481","tt0037514","4475","10","He agreed to do a few movies in 1942, but Hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time."
"1482","tt0037514","4475","11","Not only an excellent pianist, but a successful conductor as well, Iturbi was very much a household word for more than 40 years."
"1483","tt0037514","4475","12","The scene where Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies was planned early on and hasn't anyone ever noticed the other pianists were all children."
"1484","tt0037514","4475","13","Joe Pasternak, who produced that movie & many other MGM musicals, credited Iturbi with interesting America's youth in classical music."
"1485","tt0037514","4475","14","Grayson's wanting an audition with Iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time."
"1486","tt0037514","4475","15","Everyone wanted Iturbi back then."
"1487","tt0037514","4475","16","The joke among soldiers was that ""GI"" meant ""Get Iturbi"" he did a lot of concerts at military bases."
"1488","tt0037514","4475","17","Gene Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra an excellent singer, but at the time this movie was made Sinatra was barely 30 and had only been under contract to Columbia Records for four years."
"1489","tt0037514","4475","18","Kelly was already well known as a dancer, but Iturbi had by then been a world wide sensation for 20+ years."
"1490","tt0037514","4475","19","And as to the lack of a plot, Americans didn't need plot."
"1491","tt0037514","4475","20","They were tired of war, they were sick with fear for their loved ones, and worried about the future."
"1492","tt0037514","4475","21","They needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out fine in the end."
"1493","tt0037514","4475","22","They needed music and smiles and joy and romance."
"1494","tt0037514","4475","23","This movie and others like it delivered just what was needed."
"1495","tt0037514","4475","24","Enough lecturing."
"1496","tt0037514","4475","25","Mouse dancing aside, the best scene in the movie occurs between Sinatra and Iturbi with each of them ""ignorantly"" complimenting the other's music."
"1497","tt0037514","4475","26","If you have any interest in Jose Iturbi, the Spaniard who conquered more of America than De Soto, Cortez, and De Leon put together, please drop by my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find a plot summary, excerpts from movie reviews ""of the day"" and pictures from this and certain other MGM musicals of the 1940's, as well as a biography and discography of Iturbi."

"1508","tt0037514","4476","10","George Sidney's Anchors Aweigh 1945 is a great musical comedy."

"1510","tt0037514","4476","12","Frank Sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from Brooklyn."
"1511","tt0037514","4476","13","Shy isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Frank Sinatra, but he plays his part well."
"1512","tt0037514","4476","14","Kathryn Grayson is fantastic as Susan Abbott."
"1513","tt0037514","4476","15","We sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of 88."

"1520","tt0037514","4476","22","Just look at Kelly and Sinatra performing ""We Hate to Leave""."
"1521","tt0037514","4476","23","It's so energetic."""
"1522","tt0037514","4476","24","If You Knew Susie Like I Know Susie"" is quite funny."
"1523","tt0037514","4476","25","It's a nice moment when Frank sings Brahms' Lullaby to little Dean Stockwell."
"1524","tt0037514","4476","26","It's lovely to listen to Grayson singing the tango ""Jealousy"" ."
"1525","tt0037514","4476","27","The most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world, and there Gene sings and dances with Jerry Mouse."
"1526","tt0037514","4476","28","Also Tom Cat is seen there as the butler."
"1527","tt0037514","4476","29","They originally asked Mickey Mouse but he refused."
"1528","tt0037514","4476","30","The movie was nominated for five Oscars but Georgie Stoll got one for Original Music Score."
"1529","tt0037514","4476","31","Anchors Aweigh is some high class entertainment."
"1530","tt0037514","4477","1","This one has a lot going for it Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten and a lesser amount of dross Iturbi, Grayson plus a little ho hum Kelly."
"1531","tt0037514","4477","2","It was Sinatra's first real movie where the producer's spent a buck and you could see it on screen previously he'd appeared in two low budgeters, Higher And Higher and Step Lively but if they'd only relied on the Sinatra pipes and deep sixed Grayson's plus Iturbi's ego tripping piano spots we'd have been left with a much tighter movie and a better showcase for Sinatra."
"1532","tt0037514","4477","3","As it is he scores heavily in all his songs from the two duets with Kelly We Hate To Leave, I Begged Her to his own solos, What Makes The Sunset, The Charm Of You and I Fall In Love Too Easily."
"1533","tt0037514","4477","4","Despite this Step Lively remains the best Sinatra musical of the forties on one tenth the budget."
"1534","tt0037514","4478","1","Overall this is a delightful, light hearted, romantic, musical comedy."
"1535","tt0037514","4478","2","I suppose a small case could be made for the movie being to long."
"1536","tt0037514","4478","3","But I'm not sure what you would cut out."

"1542","tt0037514","4478","9","No that seems to be a common complaint many times that more recent movies don't develop the characters."
"1543","tt0037514","4478","10","Some comment that Iturbi didn't bring much to the movie but this gives us a chance to see and hear a great talent from the 1040s."
"1544","tt0037514","4478","11","So what if he wasn't an actor."
"1545","tt0037514","4478","12","He was an important part of the movie as the basic plot was to get Grayson an audition with him."
"1546","tt0037514","4478","13","Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star."
"1547","tt0037514","4478","14","Louis B."
"1548","tt0037514","4478","15","Mayer brought her to MGM for a screen test that included an aria."
"1549","tt0037514","4478","16","During her audition in the movie there is a shot of the MGM brass nodding and smiling."

"1551","tt0037514","4478","18","This movie is so full of life it is hard to hit all of the highlights."
"1552","tt0037514","4478","19","Great use was made of color and lighting throughout the movie."
"1553","tt0037514","4478","20","You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did."
"1554","tt0037514","4478","21","A nice counter point in the movie is how Sinatra a ladies man even then played the role of wanting to just find a date while on leave."
"1555","tt0037514","4478","22","You'll feel good after seeing this movie."
"1556","tt0037514","4478","23","7/10"
"1557","tt0037514","4479","1","Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me."
"1558","tt0037514","4479","2","At age 15, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals."
"1559","tt0037514","4479","3","Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players."
"1560","tt0037514","4479","4","Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance."
"1561","tt0037514","4479","5","As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm up for On the Town."
"1562","tt0037514","4479","6","Sinatra may have had to work hard at it, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and he would do better in their next pairings."
"1563","tt0037514","4479","7","However, observing his physique, it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean."
"1564","tt0037514","4479","8","Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat."
"1565","tt0037514","4479","9","Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire."
"1566","tt0037514","4479","10","Finally, it was strange to see the fresh faced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a ""thrill"" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold Loeb murder from the 1920s."
"1567","tt0037514","4479","11","An additional note: One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest."
"1568","tt0037514","4479","12","She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film."
"1569","tt0037514","4480","1","In the Citadel film series book The Films of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical."
"1570","tt0037514","4480","2","I sure can't do better than that."
"1571","tt0037514","4480","3","It's such an important film in both the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra."
"1572","tt0037514","4480","4","Kathryn Grayson didn't do too badly with this either."
"1573","tt0037514","4480","5","Louis B."
"1574","tt0037514","4480","6","Mayer had lent Gene Kelly out to Columbia where Harry Cohn had an inspiration to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it, Cover Girl became a classic."
"1575","tt0037514","4480","7","So if Mayer didn't learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly artistic control."
"1576","tt0037514","4480","8","When Anchors Aweigh was finished, Fred Astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance."
"1577","tt0037514","4480","9","The main number everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse."
"1578","tt0037514","4480","10","Originally Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney wasn't lending Mickey out to nobody."
"1579","tt0037514","4480","11","Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit to do an outside film."
"1580","tt0037514","4480","12","Not to worry because MGM had it's own animated rodent one half the team of Tom and Jerry."
"1581","tt0037514","4480","13","Kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did Fred Astaire."
"1582","tt0037514","4480","14","For the next dozen years, these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves weren't up to snuff."
"1583","tt0037514","4480","15","It was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios."
"1584","tt0037514","4480","16","In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit."
"1585","tt0037514","4480","17","In fact Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning him is Oscar for From Here to Eternity."
"1586","tt0037514","4480","18","When Frank Sinatra had half of his contract bought from RKO by MGM he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own."
"1587","tt0037514","4480","19","He'd become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn."
"1588","tt0037514","4480","20","In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells about how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film."
"1589","tt0037514","4480","21","Louis B."
"1590","tt0037514","4480","22","Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing."
"1591","tt0037514","4480","23","One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I Fall in Love Too Easily."
"1592","tt0037514","4480","24","Frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty Hollywood Bowl."
"1593","tt0037514","4480","25","It's Sinatra at his best."
"1594","tt0037514","4480","26","With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth than any other person."
"1595","tt0037514","4480","27","They were lifetime friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone boost in his career."
"1596","tt0037514","4480","28","On a bet Styne and Cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale."
"1597","tt0037514","4480","29","They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings."
"1598","tt0037514","4480","30","She also did some classical numbers."
"1599","tt0037514","4480","31","Here singing in fact is the basis of the plot."
"1600","tt0037514","4480","32","Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell."
"1601","tt0037514","4480","33","Trying to fix her up with Sinatra, Kelly says he can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi."
"1602","tt0037514","4480","34","They spend the film trying to accomplish just that."
"1603","tt0037514","4480","35","My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays the waitress 'Brooklyn' never got a number herself."
"1604","tt0037514","4480","36","She had gotten rave reviews from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood."
"1605","tt0037514","4480","37","I have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in MGM's vaults it might still be."
"1606","tt0037514","4480","38","Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals just aren't made any more."
"1607","tt0037514","4480","39","All that creative talent was under contract to Metro Goldwyn Mayer."
"1608","tt0037514","4480","40","If you had to pay market value for it, the cost might retire some third world country's debt."
"1609","tt0037514","4480","41","But the film results would be extraordinary."
"1610","tt0037514","4481","1","The only reason I give this movie 8/10 stars, and not 10, is because 1 Sinatra is awful and 2 the love interest of Kelly's character leaves much to be desired, IMHO."
"1611","tt0037514","4481","2","Do love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap Al, is the little boy."
"1612","tt0037514","4481","3","The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I have ever seen."
"1613","tt0037514","4481","4","Tom and Jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter's."
"1614","tt0037514","4481","5","I'm 28 and she's 4, so while the character is less iconic than Mickey, he is still a favorite of many children and adults today."
"1615","tt0037514","4481","6","Kelly is as always captivating, his eyes full of fun and excitement."
"1616","tt0037514","4481","7","In every movie I have ever seen him in, he always steals the show."
"1617","tt0037514","4481","8","One of the best dancers of the 20th century."
"1618","tt0037514","4481","9","It is no wonder Paula Abdul ""sampled"" Kelly's moves."
"1619","tt0037514","4481","10","I would also list Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century."
"1620","tt0037514","4481","11","If you were to watch only one part, don't miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse."
"1621","tt0037514","4481","12","You will NOT be disappointed."
"1622","tt0037514","4482","1","ANCHORS AWEIGH sees two eager young sailors, Joe Brady Gene Kelly and Clarence Doolittle/Brooklyn Frank Sinatra, get a special four day shore leave."
"1623","tt0037514","4482","2","Eager to get to the girls, particularly Joe's Lola, neither Joe nor Brooklyn figure on the interruption of little Navy mad Donald Dean Stockwell and his Aunt Susie Kathryn Grayson."
"1624","tt0037514","4482","3","Unexperienced in the ways of females and courting, Brooklyn quickly enlists Joe to help him win Aunt Susie over."
"1625","tt0037514","4482","4","Along the way, however, Joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend."
"1626","tt0037514","4482","5","How is Brooklyn going to take this betrayal."
"1627","tt0037514","4482","6","And does Joe end up with Susie, who loves him too."
"1628","tt0037514","4482","7","The first and second times I saw ANCHORS AWEIGH, I also saw it at the same time as I did ON THE TOWN, the Kelly/Sinatra collaboration from 1949."
"1629","tt0037514","4482","8","Both times I felt that ANCHORS AWEIGH was the better film in terms of plotting and structure all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot, and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them."
"1630","tt0037514","4482","9","Yet, both times I came away feeling that ON THE TOWN is the better film overall."
"1631","tt0037514","4482","10","Having now seen both films a third time, I still stand by that judgement."
"1632","tt0037514","4482","11","Somehow ON THE TOWN, as a film and a piece of entertainment, is just lighter, gayer, purely and simply happier."
"1633","tt0037514","4482","12","The numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot, and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in ANCHORS AWEIGH."
"1634","tt0037514","4482","13","I'm not quite sure why this is."
"1635","tt0037514","4482","14","The typical argument is that the latter film is over long: at almost two and a half hours, this is certainly a valid criticism to make."
"1636","tt0037514","4482","15","I certainly felt the length the first two times I saw it!"
"1637","tt0037514","4482","16","However, it's also a film that grows on you the more you see it, the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making."
"1638","tt0037514","4482","17","And yet, something just doesn't hang together quite right."
"1639","tt0037514","4482","18","It feels almost as if the script was pored over, and every single moment when Kelly could break into dance or Sinatra into song was noted, and that's exactly what happened."
"1640","tt0037514","4482","19","No opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up... and that's probably the film's biggest weakness."
"1641","tt0037514","4482","20","It has 16 numbers give or take a few, and no matter how big a fan you are of Kelly or Sinatra, this really starts to turn one numb after a while."
"1642","tt0037514","4482","21","Contrast this, for example, with the ten numbers in ON THE TOWN."
"1643","tt0037514","4482","22","You might well feel that each song, each dance, can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking... and that's true."
"1644","tt0037514","4482","23","But that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place."
"1645","tt0037514","4482","24","All this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about ANCHORS AWEIGH."
"1646","tt0037514","4482","25","The musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over, like the duets between Kelly and Sinatra 'We Hate To Leave', 'I Begged Her' and 'If You Knew Susie', the singing of Sinatra 'What Makes The Sunset', 'The Charm Of You', and the best of all, 'I Fall In Love Too Easily', and without a doubt the always inventive, always breathtaking dancing of Kelly."
"1647","tt0037514","4482","26","It's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre."
"1648","tt0037514","4482","27","Grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening; Jose Iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it; even Clarence's own Brooklyn, Pamela Britton, is cute and charming... as close as one could get to Betty Garrett without being Garrett herself!"
"1649","tt0037514","4482","28","Sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his, and plays the innocent boy man wonderfully a role he reprises in ON THE TOWN."
"1650","tt0037514","4482","29","His singing is, as usual, simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing."
"1651","tt0037514","4482","30","His solo numbers might seem to drag a little, but when you've got the voice of a century, showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film!"
"1652","tt0037514","4482","31","Gene Kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph."
"1653","tt0037514","4482","32","Third in the billing behind Sinatra and Grayson respectively, ANCHORS AWEIGH really is Kelly's film."
"1654","tt0037514","4482","33","His Joe Brady is a believable, real character he's tough on the outside, glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal, but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside."
"1655","tt0037514","4482","34","Kelly makes this charming rather than cloying, but also gives Joe a real edge that you see in the scene when Joe chases Brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands."
"1656","tt0037514","4482","35","And the dancing again, the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome, as it does with Sinatra's singing."
"1657","tt0037514","4482","36","But once again, if it's Gene Kelly doing the softshoe, or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief... might as well err on the side of overdoing it!"
"1658","tt0037514","4482","37","All of Kelly's dances are breathtaking, be it the pared down simplicity of his tap number with Sinatra to 'I Begged Her', his 'Mexican Hat Dance' with the sweet wide eyed little girl, or his lavish Spanish influenced dance 'La Cumparsita'."
"1659","tt0037514","4482","38","Of course, the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be Kelly in his red, white and blue sailor suit, dancing with Jerry Mouse of 'Tom & Jerry' fame."
"1660","tt0037514","4482","39","A well deserved golden film memory, to be sure it's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945, given the saturation of CGI in the contemporary film market."
"1661","tt0037514","4482","40","But Gene and Jerry still look great, with Kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look."
"1662","tt0037514","4482","41","It would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with Gene Kelly would be Kelly himself in COVER GIRL and a cartoon animation."
"1663","tt0037514","4482","42","It's doubtless that this first daring, inventive Kelly dance with Jerry has reserved a place for ANCHORS AWEIGH in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs."
"1664","tt0037514","4482","43","But it's also notable for being the first of three Kelly/Sinatra film collaborations, and though rather too drawn out, still a great couple of hours of entertainment."
"1665","tt0037514","4482","44","Watch it first, then again and maybe again it'll grow on you before you realise it!"
"1666","tt0037514","4482","45","7.5/10"
"1667","tt0037514","4483","1","Everything a musical comedy should be."
"1668","tt0037514","4483","2","Gene Kelly as Joe Brady doesn't miss a step, and Frank Sinatra as Clarence Doolittle doesn't miss a note."
"1669","tt0037514","4483","3","Scenes with them together are very good, showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot."
"1670","tt0037514","4483","4","Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future best."
"1671","tt0037514","4483","5","Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is delightful."
"1672","tt0037514","4483","6","Kelly certainly earned his nomination as Best Actor."
"1673","tt0037514","4483","7","And there is a bushel of truly funny lines, like: ""You think the navy takes dopes."""
"1674","tt0037514","4483","8","; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep.""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."""
"1675","tt0037514","4483","9","A thoroughly enjoyable movie, just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded World War II."
"1676","tt0037514","4484","1","Released some months before the end of the war, ""Anchors Aweigh"" is one of Gene Kelly's major musical triumphs of the forties Under the direction of George Sidney, it had the benefits of a pleasant score, andbest of allthe services of Gene Kelly in his first true starring role at MGM The year before, in Columbia's ""Cover Girl,"" he had revealed an innovative approach to dance on the screen, a light but agreeable singing voice, and considerable charm In ""Anchors Aweigh,"" although he was billed under Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson, he was laying the solid groundwork for his most revealing years at MGM The film's story, a kind of dry run for ""On the Town"" four years later, follows sailors Kelly and Sinatra on shore leave, spend their holiday in Hollywood, where they become involved in the affairs of an aspiring singer Grayson and her little nephew Dean Stockwell."
"1677","tt0037514","4484","2","Grayson, it appears, has her heart set on an audition with conductor pianist Jose Iturbi She gets the audition, of course; Kelly gets Grayson after some misunderstandings; and Sinatra, has forgotten to be shy, and has lost his heart to a girl from Brooklyn Pamela Britton."
"1678","tt0037514","4484","3","The plot is conventional for the period but, regrettably, it now seems barely tolerable But there is Gene Kelly, who dominates the movie with his agreeable personality Perhaps he grins too much, but when is permitted to dance, the film finally lifts off the ground ""I Begged Her,"" his early song and dance with Sinatra, is amusing and slightly absurd, in which he imagines himself as a bandit chieftain in a Spanish courtyard, courting maiden Grayson with a flamboyant flamenco dance and some athletic leaps He also does a charming Mexican dance with little Sharon McManus in the square of a Mexican settlement in Los Angeles The highlight of the movie, however, is Kelly's famous dance with the cartoon character Jerry the Mouse of ""Tom and Jerry"" fame."
"1679","tt0037514","4484","4","Delightful and innovative, it skillfully combines live action and animation in its tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until Kelly, a sailor in the ""Pomeranian Navy,"" wearing a striped shirt and a beret, shows him how to dance ""Look at me, I'm dancin'!"""
"1680","tt0037514","4484","5","says the gleeful mouse king..."
"1681","tt0040613","1076","1","Super slick entertainment with a stellar cast, an outstanding script, and a firm grip on the approaching 1950's."
"1682","tt0040613","1076","2","At the time, RKO was turning out classic noirs by the dozens."
"1683","tt0040613","1076","3","But whatever the value of those shadowy downers, they reflected a war time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the Eisenhower era."
"1684","tt0040613","1076","4","Few films of the late 40's are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy."
"1685","tt0040613","1076","5","Jim Blandings Cary Grant works as an ad man on Madison Ave. where in his little daughter's words he sells things to people that they don't need, at prices they can't afford."
"1686","tt0040613","1076","6","He's making good money, but like thousands of others, he's tired of living in a cramped urban ""cave""."
"1687","tt0040613","1076","7","So, with wife Myrnah Loy, they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the Connecticutt countryside."
"1688","tt0040613","1076","8","Needless to say, in the arms of nature, they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion."
"1689","tt0040613","1076","9","There's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script."
"1690","tt0040613","1076","10","I don't know if writers Panama and Frank got an Oscar, but they should have."
"1691","tt0040613","1076","11","Of course, the humor revolves around all the problems that pop up when city people build a big house on rural land."
"1692","tt0040613","1076","12","The annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage, with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving Grant a hard time."
"1693","tt0040613","1076","13","Of course, no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than Grant, so it's just one well placed laugh after another, particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own."
"1694","tt0040613","1076","14","Yet, oddly, the film appears to have no comedic high point."
"1695","tt0040613","1076","15","Instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don't peak at any particular point."
"1696","tt0040613","1076","16","That's a real movie triumph for any era."
"1697","tt0040613","1076","17","Reaching back 60 years later, we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind."
"1698","tt0040613","1076","18","With their live in maid, the Blandings may not be a typical American family, but that post war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical."
"1699","tt0040613","1076","19","And what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than Blandings as an ""ad man"" tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more ""ham""."
"1700","tt0040613","1076","20","More than anything, however, there's the movie's sunny optimism."
"1701","tt0040613","1076","21","Oh sure, the feeling falters at times, yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the Blandings just stick to their dream carries them through."
"1702","tt0040613","1076","22","Indeed, life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge, so I expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day."
"1703","tt0040613","1076","23","It's that easily over looked subtext, along with the sheer entertainment value, that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post war period."
"1704","tt0040613","1076","24","So, if you haven't seen it, catch it next time around."
"1705","tt0040613","1077","1","This is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and ARE WE DONE YET., only points out all the more how the 40's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since, regretfully, been lost."
"1706","tt0040613","1077","2","I was 15 when I first saw this and even at that tender age, there was much I could laugh at."
"1707","tt0040613","1077","3","Now of course being familiar with adult frustrations, I see a whole lot that I missed as a youth."
"1708","tt0040613","1077","4","The three main actors..."
"1709","tt0040613","1077","5","Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas...interacted perfectly, but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream."
"1710","tt0040613","1077","6","It's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions."
"1711","tt0040613","1077","7","All in all, this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it."
"1712","tt0040613","1078","1","Coinciding with the start of the baby boom, the years after World War II saw an unprecedented exodus of Americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes."
"1713","tt0040613","1078","2","Directed by H.C."
"1714","tt0040613","1078","3","Potter and co written by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank ""White Christmas"", this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well."
"1715","tt0040613","1078","4","Of course, it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs  Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and an especially acerbic Melvyn Douglas  head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership."
"1716","tt0040613","1078","5","Even though the film is sixty years old now, there is a timeless quality to the Blandings' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it."
"1717","tt0040613","1078","6","Obviously, Hollywood thinks so since it's been remade at least twice first as a very physical Tom Hanks comedy, 1986's ""The Money Pit"", and again last year with Ice Cube's ""Are We Done Yet.""."
"1718","tt0040613","1078","7","One look at HGTV's programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today."
"1719","tt0040613","1078","8","The plot begins with ad man Jim Blandings, his wife Muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom one bath Manhattan apartment."
"1720","tt0040613","1078","9","Rather than pursue Muriel's idea to renovate the apartment for $7,000, Jim sees a photo of a Connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move."
"1721","tt0040613","1078","10","With the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend Bill Cole, the Blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair."
"1722","tt0040613","1078","11","However, the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one."
"1723","tt0040613","1078","12","This sparks the Blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first."
"1724","tt0040613","1078","13","Costs rise with each new complication, tempers flare, and even a romantic triangle is imagined among, Jim, Muriel and Bill."
"1725","tt0040613","1078","14","Priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not so blissful ignorance of the new homeowners."
"1726","tt0040613","1078","15","With his double takes and flawless line delivery, Grant is infallible in this type of farce, and Jim Blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid career characters."
"1727","tt0040613","1078","16","In a role originally meant for Irene Dunne, Myrna Loy shows why she was Hollywood's perfect wife."
"1728","tt0040613","1078","17","She doesn't get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make Muriel an appealing character on her own."
"1729","tt0040613","1078","18","Watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette."
"1730","tt0040613","1078","19","As avuncular, pipe smoking Bill ""Cole Bill Cole"", Melvyn Douglas shows his natural, easy going élan as Grant's foil."
"1731","tt0040613","1078","20","Smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by Harry Shannon as the laconic well digger Mr."
"1732","tt0040613","1078","21","Tesander, Lurene Tuttle as Jim's officious assistant Mary, and Louise Beavers as the Blandings' lovable maid Gussie."
"1733","tt0040613","1078","22","The 2004 DVD provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing Grant and Dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling Grant with his then wife, actress Betsy Drake."
"1734","tt0040613","1078","23","A most appropriate 1949 cartoon, ""The House of Tomorrow"", is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house."
"1735","tt0040613","1078","24","The original theatrical trailers for ten of Grant's film classics complete the extras."
"1736","tt0040613","1079","1","Though not seen in too many films prior, you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since."
"1737","tt0040613","1079","2","Not one of Grant's nor Loy's best films, they make an outstanding effort together."
"1738","tt0040613","1079","3","After all, with that much talent and very good supporting cast, you know the laughs will be there."
"1739","tt0040613","1079","4","The film is light, has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through."
"1740","tt0040613","1079","5","A great example of classic American film fare that has stood the test of time."
"1741","tt0040613","1079","6","Definite Saturday afternoon fare, heavy on the popcorn."
"1742","tt0040613","1080","1","Movie ""comedies"" nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor, foul language, and groin kicking."
"1743","tt0040613","1080","2","Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the undemanding and slow of brain."
"1744","tt0040613","1080","3","Sure, an occasional good comedy will come along, but they're becoming rarer all the time."""
"1745","tt0040613","1080","4","Mr."
"1746","tt0040613","1080","5","Blandings Buildings his Dream House"" shows what 1940s Hollywood was capable of, and it's just screamingly funny."
"1747","tt0040613","1080","6","Jim and Muriel Blandings Cary Grant and Myrna Loy decide to build a house in the Connecticut suburbs."
"1748","tt0040613","1080","7","The film follows their story, beginning with house hunting trips, the house's riotous construction, all the way to the finished home with its ""zuzz zuzz water softener""."
"1749","tt0040613","1080","8","Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course Grant is particularly funny as he watches the house's costs zoom out of control."
"1750","tt0040613","1080","9","However, the film is stolen by the Blandings' wise attorney, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas."
"1751","tt0040613","1080","10","Managing to steal every scene he's in, Douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the Blandings lurch from crisis to crisis."
"1752","tt0040613","1080","11","Reginald Denny as the Blandings' harried architect and Harry Shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful."
"1753","tt0040613","1080","12","I've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh."
"1754","tt0040613","1080","13","I think it's a good film to watch when you need a lift, whether you're building a house or not."
"1755","tt0040613","1081","1","One of the great classic comedies."
"1756","tt0040613","1081","2","Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama."
"1757","tt0040613","1081","3","A fun, satirical film, a buyers beware guide to a new home."
"1758","tt0040613","1081","4","Filled with great characters all of whom, Cary Grant is convinced, are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home."
"1759","tt0040613","1081","5","A great look at life in the late 40's."
"1760","tt0040613","1082","1","Mr."
"1761","tt0040613","1082","2","Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made!"
"1762","tt0040613","1082","3","If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life movies made with wit, taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek, check this one out."
"1763","tt0040613","1082","4","Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed."
"1764","tt0040613","1082","5","Grant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire."
"1765","tt0040613","1082","6","Loy is adorable as his pre NOW wife."
"1766","tt0040613","1082","7","The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker."
"1767","tt0040613","1082","8","Art Direction and Editing are way above par."
"1768","tt0040613","1082","9","The movie never stoops to the low rent, by the numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit."
"1769","tt0040613","1083","1","Another example of the unique talents of Cary Grant."
"1770","tt0040613","1083","2","A performance worthy of Oscar consideration, yet once again shunned by the Academy."
"1771","tt0040613","1083","3","Mr."
"1772","tt0040613","1083","4","Grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city."
"1773","tt0040613","1083","5","The pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis loosely for the more modern Tom Hanks vehicle, ""The Money Pit""."
"1774","tt0040613","1083","6","If you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex, this movie is a must see."
"1775","tt0040613","1084","1","Musings: Pure delight from beginning to end."
"1776","tt0040613","1084","2","Not a laugh riot, but a more subtle, sophisticated humor."
"1777","tt0040613","1084","3","What a goldmine of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr.."
"1778","tt0040613","1084","4","Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed."
"1779","tt0040613","1084","5","A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his ""lallies to be rabbeted"", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know."
"1780","tt0040613","1084","6","Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative."
"1781","tt0040613","1084","7","At that, Barker yells up to his mates, ""OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so...."
"1782","tt0040613","1084","8","YANK 'EM OUT!"""
"1783","tt0040613","1084","9","A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards."
"1784","tt0040613","1084","10","All Grant can do is moan."
"1785","tt0040613","1084","11","Yes, the movie IS dated."
"1786","tt0040613","1084","12","You'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks."
"1787","tt0040613","1084","13","A classic movie that is really a treasure."
"1788","tt0040613","1085","1","This movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about Murphy's Law being applied to home ownership and construction."
"1789","tt0040613","1085","2","If a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional."
"1790","tt0040613","1085","3","Since it was set in the 'simpler' forties, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era."
"1791","tt0040613","1085","4","Grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by Loy and Douglas."
"1792","tt0040613","1085","5","Their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10."
"1793","tt0040613","1086","1","This movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace."
"1794","tt0040613","1086","2","While this makes it pretty different from the average Grant film, it is still highly watchable and entertaining."
"1795","tt0040613","1086","3","It's sort of like someone said ""let's just follow Cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed""."
"1796","tt0040613","1086","4","Considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well."
"1797","tt0040613","1086","5","While the film has pretty modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material."
"1798","tt0040613","1086","6","It's a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family."
"1799","tt0040613","1087","1","There is so much to love in this darling little comedy."
"1800","tt0040613","1087","2","Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just been short of space,will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled Mr."
"1801","tt0040613","1087","3","Blanding."
"1802","tt0040613","1087","4","Melvyn Douglas,with great comedic flare, both narrates and acts as the Blandings' attorney and voice of reason."
"1803","tt0040613","1087","5","As well Myrna Loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife."
"1804","tt0040613","1087","6","But the best performance is Grant's."
"1805","tt0040613","1087","7","He is the American everyman, especially relevant at the time of this film's release, when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war."
"1806","tt0040613","1087","8","The themes are universal,lack of money, work strain, fear of infidelity."
"1807","tt0040613","1087","9","Yes, it does wrap up awfully neatly, but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending."
"1808","tt0040613","1087","10","It is still relevant today, and I must chalk up the poor reviews I see to a present preference for dumbed down, gross out comedies."
"1809","tt0040613","1087","11","The look of the film is slick, and there are some great bits of comedy is well, particularly toward the beginning."
"1810","tt0040613","1087","12","While it may have lost some of it's social relevance, nearly sixty years after it's release, it is still a gem."
"1811","tt0040613","1088","1","Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams."
"1812","tt0040613","1088","2","It all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget."
"1813","tt0040613","1088","3","There are many great laughs even if the story is somewhat thin sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s Hollywood comedy style."
"1814","tt0040613","1088","4","A definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses, which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience."
"1815","tt0040613","1088","5","As he makes his exit, he assures the client Grant that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $100.00 from the total...or at least $50.00...but certainly $25.00."
"1816","tt0040613","1088","6","Hilarious!"
"1817","tt0040613","1089","1","This movie was made in 1948, but it still rings true today."
"1818","tt0040613","1089","2","Very, very funny."
"1819","tt0040613","1089","3","It begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it ""builds"" from there."
"1820","tt0040613","1089","4","Anyone who has ever built a house, will find this movie very endearing."
"1821","tt0040613","1089","5","Great cast."
"1822","tt0040613","1089","6","Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film."
"1823","tt0040613","1089","7","This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's....clothing, architecture and family life."
"1824","tt0040613","1089","8","Many references are made to the cost of things, and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing."
"1825","tt0040613","1089","9","I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely."
"1826","tt0040613","1089","10","I am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it."
"1827","tt0040613","1089","11","A true classic."
"1828","tt0040613","1090","1","One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr."
"1829","tt0040613","1090","2","Blandings Builds His Dream House."
"1830","tt0040613","1090","3","Although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today."
"1831","tt0040613","1090","4","Still Cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of Wham."
"1832","tt0040613","1090","5","What made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post World War II years."
"1833","tt0040613","1090","6","Returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the GI Bill of Rights which included home loans."
"1834","tt0040613","1090","7","The problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand."
"1835","tt0040613","1090","8","Around the time the book by Eric Hodgins and the film were so popular Congress passed and President Truman signed the Taft Ellender Wagner Housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business."
"1836","tt0040613","1090","9","I had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early Fifties."
"1837","tt0040613","1090","10","Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city Rochester."
"1838","tt0040613","1090","11","Their place wasn't quite as grand as a house in Connecticut with eighteen rooms, still they lived there the rest of their lives the way Cary and Myrna most likely did."
"1839","tt0040613","1090","12","Of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners."
"1840","tt0040613","1090","13","Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas around to offer counsel, usually too late."
"1841","tt0040613","1090","14","Truth be told he's kind of sweet on Myrna and Cary knows it."
"1842","tt0040613","1090","15","Myrna Loy's role is simply an extension of Nora Charles."
"1843","tt0040613","1090","16","If you can imagine the Charles's moving to the country and William Powell having the headaches Cary Grant does, the film would still work just fine."
"1844","tt0040613","1090","17","Mr."
"1845","tt0040613","1090","18","Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as comedy because the situations are universal."
"1846","tt0040613","1090","19","And this review is dedicated to my Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years."
"1847","tt0040613","1091","1","I loved this film."
"1848","tt0040613","1091","2","I first saw it when I was 20 which was only four years ago and I enjoyed it so much, I brought my own copy the next day."
"1849","tt0040613","1091","3","The comedy is well played by all involved."
"1850","tt0040613","1091","4","I always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where Mr."
"1851","tt0040613","1091","5","Tsanders explains why he found water at 6 ft in one area and 227 feet in another area."
"1852","tt0040613","1091","6","Also look for Jason Robards father who plays Mr."
"1853","tt0040613","1091","7","Retch."
"1854","tt0040613","1091","8","Talent ran in that family."
"1855","tt0040613","1092","1","By the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over, as films were moving in a different direction, comedically and otherwise."
"1856","tt0040613","1092","2","With television looming on the horizon, Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time."
"1857","tt0040613","1092","3","Where, one wonders, would movies have gone had television not come along, or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years."
"1858","tt0040613","1092","4","Mr."
"1859","tt0040613","1092","5","Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed."
"1860","tt0040613","1092","6","Ad man Jim Blandings, along with his wife and two daughters, are living in a nice but way too cramped New York City apartment, as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs."
"1861","tt0040613","1092","7","So he buys some property in Connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications."
"1862","tt0040613","1092","8","Well, almost."
"1863","tt0040613","1092","9","Had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind."
"1864","tt0040613","1092","10","Then again he might not have."
"1865","tt0040613","1092","11","You decide."
"1866","tt0040613","1092","12","On this frail premise a wonderful film results, full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one."
"1867","tt0040613","1092","13","Nothing comes easy in this life, as Mr."
"1868","tt0040613","1092","14","Blandings learns; but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way."
"1869","tt0040613","1092","15","There is, after all, the long run."
"1870","tt0040613","1092","16","But, Blandings asks himself every few minutes, how long is long."
"1871","tt0040613","1092","17","This movie is a delight."
"1872","tt0040613","1092","18","It is not, I suppose, a masterpiece in the Capra McCarey tradition, but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures, and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically."
"1873","tt0040613","1092","19","There is real warmth in the picture, and a good deal of W.C."
"1874","tt0040613","1092","20","Fieldsian hard edged reality obtruding periodically, but not so much as to leave a bad taste."
"1875","tt0040613","1092","21","The people in the film are all very smart and affluent, but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class."
"1876","tt0040613","1092","22","Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr. and Mrs."
"1877","tt0040613","1092","23","Blandings to perfection; while Melvyn Douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend, who often has to bring up unpleasant topics, such as how the real world works."
"1878","tt0040613","1092","24","There is, too, a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia, which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years, as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place."
"1879","tt0040613","1092","25","These people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural Connecticut."
"1880","tt0040613","1092","26","In a few short years things would change, as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear, destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns, which soon would be connected by highways, littered with bottles and cans, their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city."
"1881","tt0040613","1093","1","I always enjoy this movie when it shows up on TV.The one scene that always stands out, for me that is, is the one with the Myrna Loy and the painters foreman, where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says ""Did you get that, that's yellow, blue, green and white"""
"1882","tt0040613","1094","1","This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and still laugh out loud."
"1883","tt0040613","1094","2","In other places, I have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious, politically correct prigs."

"2015","tt0040613","1103","5","Comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued, and is very difficult to imitate."
"2016","tt0040613","1103","6","A good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long."

"2026","tt0040613","1104","8","Myrna Loy is in a pretty thankless role it's evident that Grant's character Jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting, and Grant, as always, pulls both off with remarkable aplomb, but she gives Muriel a colour, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give a character."

"2046","tt0040613","1105","16","The third character, Bill Cole, an old boyfriend of Myrna, turned lawyer for the Blandings, is suave and debonair, the way Melvin Douglas portrayed him."

"2054","tt0042832","4909","3","Here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong."
"2055","tt0042832","4909","4","The accents are not too bad yes, the ""yat"" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern, the city of 1950 is shown the way it is/was, without the obligatory ""tourist"" shots, and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a ""quirky southerner""."
"2056","tt0042832","4909","5","One of the few films to do justice to this city, and a good film to boot.."
"2057","tt0042832","4910","1","This very good movie crackles with tension."
"2058","tt0042832","4910","2","The stakes are, of course, high will the police and Widmark, the public health doctor, apprehend the criminals who don't know that they are carrying plague before a full scale epidemic breaks out."
"2059","tt0042832","4910","3","But smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene between Widmark and the police captain, between the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a dying plague stricken man whom Palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity, between Widmark and his wife, and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full scale panic."
"2060","tt0042832","4910","4","The movie is beautifully shot by Kazan, in extraordinarily well choreographed long takes shot on location in New Orleans, and ends in a stunning climax, where Palance flees like a rat from his pursuers, through the docks and warehouses of the city."
"2061","tt0042832","4910","5","The commentary is superb, probably the best that I've heard, covering the cinematography, the framing and lighting of shots, the production design, the casting of non professional actors in small roles, and the ironies and parallelisms in the plot, like an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally."
"2062","tt0042832","4910","6","Watch it once to enjoy the film on its own, and, if you are interested in film making, a second time with the commentary on to learn."
"2063","tt0042832","4911","1","This film has, over the past ten years, become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences."
"2064","tt0042832","4911","2","The three storyline threads given us by Kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures."
"2065","tt0042832","4911","3","The domestic chitchat between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between rooms, the small gestures such as the phone book Barbara places on the chair under her son so he can reach the table, those small intimate exchanges between husband and wife, all are well crafted and natural."
"2066","tt0042832","4911","4","More than anything else, I love their porch, that second living room where it is clear they spend much of their summer time."
"2067","tt0042832","4911","5","The second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film but especially between Widmark and Douglas' characters."
"2068","tt0042832","4911","6","It may not be totally original and does get a bit blustery but all in all, it comes across as real, respectful and efficient."
"2069","tt0042832","4911","7","The third thread,the grungy tale of Blackie and his tattered little gang, gets us closest to a dark and frightening noir world."
"2070","tt0042832","4911","8","Palance's Blackie is as cold as a block of ice."
"2071","tt0042832","4911","9","This self proclaimed business man, this self made man clearly has a complexity we only briefly tap in to."
"2072","tt0042832","4911","10","For me, this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience."
"2073","tt0042832","4912","1","One of America's most brilliant film directors was without question Elia Kazan."
"2074","tt0042832","4912","2","His directorial genius was not particularly suited to taut thrillers, since Kazan needed more room to breathe and to be slower and more subtle."
"2075","tt0042832","4912","3","However, 'Panic in the Streets' is a first rate social thriller and is if anything more relevant to today than it was to 1950 when it was released."
"2076","tt0042832","4912","4","The themes of illegal immigrants, people smuggling, imminent plagues, rapid transmission around the world of diseases a worried Richard Widmark says: 'I could be in any American city in ten hours and in Africa tomorrow.', ethnic isolation and ghettoism are today's concerns more than ever."
"2077","tt0042832","4912","5","This film features a spectacular film debut by Jack Palance, and a wonderful performance by Barbara Bel Geddes, two casting strokes of genius."
"2078","tt0042832","4912","6","Richard Widmark is allowed not to be a psychopath for once, and is a deeply caring, warmly loving, intense hero of the people."
"2079","tt0042832","4912","7","He leads basically a one man campaign to stop an epidemic of pneumonic plague in New Orleans, struggling to convince sluggish politicians and complacent policemen that there is a problem."
"2080","tt0042832","4912","8","There is a race against time to find the small time crooks who have contracted the plague from a dead illegal immigrant within 48 hours, before the whole city, and as they are always reminding us, the whole country, are endangered with the worst thing since the 1919 flu."
"2081","tt0042832","4912","9","One amazing scene where Jack Palance, who is infected, is prevented from climbing aboard a ship by a rat barrier on the rope is ironic in the extreme, reminding us in the most gruesome terms that humans can be the worst carriers and vermin of all."
"2082","tt0042832","4912","10","The highly dramatic chase scenes in what they call 'the coffee factory' at the wharfs rivals the most inventive climax scenes of Hitchcock, and with just as spectacular a setting."
"2083","tt0042832","4912","11","Many non professionals appear in the film, which has the gritty realism of, well, something called reality."
"2084","tt0042832","4912","12","Kazan really takes the cameras into places where even people rarely went, and where even rats would have thought twice."
"2085","tt0042832","4912","13","This film was a major feat of social realism."
"2086","tt0042832","4912","14","If it lacks the electricity of the most highly charged thrillers, it is because Kazan took it so seriously that he could not hype it up, for after all, the threat of plague is serious enough to scare anybody without the need for extra guns and molls."
"2087","tt0042832","4912","15","The only unfortunate thing about the film is the title, which gives a false suggestion of superficiality."
"2088","tt0042832","4912","16","But Kazan was anything but superficial."
"2089","tt0042832","4912","17","He clearly considered this project a public duty, to alert us to genuine possibilities."
"2090","tt0042832","4912","18","If only those possibilities had diminished today, but alas, they are getting worse every day."
"2091","tt0042832","4912","19","One day, after a worldwide plague, this film may be shown to a few survivors as an example of how an outbreak was contained on film, but its lessons were forgotten."
"2092","tt0042832","4913","1","The title overstates the content of this movie somewhat, which might lead to some unrealized expectations."
"2093","tt0042832","4913","2","Frankly speaking, there's very little ""panic in the streets"" to be seen here."
"2094","tt0042832","4913","3","In fact, throughout the movie very few people actually know that there's a murderer on the loose who may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters."
"2095","tt0042832","4913","4","Having said that, what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway because, unlike the people ""in the streets"", the viewer knows what's going on and that director Elia Kazan builds very deliberately."
"2096","tt0042832","4913","5","As the plague infected killer is sought, one of the more interesting sidebars I found was the developing relationship between Dr."
"2097","tt0042832","4913","6","Reed Richard Widmark and Police Captain Warren Paul Douglas."
"2098","tt0042832","4913","7","At the beginning, the two really don't like each other, even though they have to work together."
"2099","tt0042832","4913","8","By the end, they've forged a real bond of respect for each other."
"2100","tt0042832","4913","9","Kazan did a good job with that."
"2101","tt0042832","4913","10","Pretty much all the performances here were excellent."
"2102","tt0042832","4913","11","Widmark and Douglas were great, and I was quite taken with a very early look at Jack Palance playing what would become his typical ""heavy"" role."
"2103","tt0042832","4913","12","I found very little to criticize here."
"2104","tt0042832","4913","13","Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes came across as a little bit flat as Reed's wife Nancy, but her role wasn't really central to the story."
"2105","tt0042832","4913","14","All in all, an excellent piece of work."
"2106","tt0042832","4913","15","9/10"
"2107","tt0042832","4914","1","A small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store, and picking stuff just because I haven't seen it."
"2108","tt0042832","4914","2","A large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen."
"2109","tt0042832","4914","3","Long before Elia Kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies not good ones, he made this better than average drama."
"2110","tt0042832","4914","4","Watching it you begin to notice how many decent, good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated."
"2111","tt0042832","4914","5","Contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large... preferably large, and unsubtle, and scandalous."
"2112","tt0042832","4914","6","Kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director. um."
"2113","tt0042832","4914","7","No thanks His future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot."
"2114","tt0042832","4914","8","The plague is coming!"
"2115","tt0042832","4914","9","But here's an atypical Richard Widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope; here's an almost watchable Barabra bel Geddes, with her bathos turned way down well, for her; they're a couple and they share some nicely written scenes about big crises and smaller ones."
"2116","tt0042832","4914","10","Here's an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships crew; here's a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment."
"2117","tt0042832","4914","11","These are the small scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life; something Hollywood, in its greed, now studiously avoids."
"2118","tt0042832","4914","12","These are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them."
"2119","tt0042832","4914","13","It's a personable, human scaled film, not the grotesque, overscaled production that he and others David Lean will later popularize, whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as Pirates of the Caribean and Moulin Rouge."
"2120","tt0042832","4914","14","I just watched it twice and I'll be damned if I could tell you what Jack Palance is seeking in the final scenes, but it doesn't seem that important to me as a viewer."
"2121","tt0042832","4914","15","This reminds me of both No Way Out a Poitier noir with Widmark as the villain, and Naked City, which you should really get your hands on."
"2122","tt0042832","4915","1","And a rather Unexpected plot line too for the era: there is Plague in the City of New Orleans and only Richard Widmark can stop it!"
"2123","tt0042832","4915","2","Elia Kazan's trademark subjects: waterfronts, working men, crowds, fugitives, blue collar folk, violence on a backstreet are all showcased here."
"2124","tt0042832","4915","3","Jack Palance is quite effective as the ice cold mobster out for a big score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise somewhat miscast but certainly watchable as his go fer."
"2125","tt0042832","4915","4","I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as the stalwart, cool wife I thought she and Widmark were a believable couple."
"2126","tt0042832","4915","5","He himself always reminds me somewhat of Sinatra in the face and in the intense quiet manner and that is meant as a compliment if anything."
"2127","tt0042832","4915","6","I'd never even heard of this movie, and yes, you have to admire Widmark's performance."
"2128","tt0042832","4915","7","I also enjoyed Paul Douglas he seemed to play this role many times, they make an unlikely but effective team."
"2129","tt0042832","4915","8","The plague itself is a McGuffin and you gotta know it's not exactly done the way it would have been in Real Life rather small scale at the least no. but I found it carried the plot along nicely."
"2130","tt0042832","4915","9","Check this out."
"2131","tt0042832","4915","10","It's good.  outta"
"2132","tt0042832","4916","1","Plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan."
"2133","tt0042832","4916","2","Kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes."
"2134","tt0042832","4916","3","A man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game."
"2135","tt0042832","4916","4","It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact."
"2136","tt0042832","4916","5","City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease."
"2137","tt0042832","4916","6","A detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles."
"2138","tt0042832","4916","7","Streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community."
"2139","tt0042832","4916","8","Regardless of outcome, you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film's protagonist."
"2140","tt0042832","4916","9","Richard Widmark as Dr."
"2141","tt0042832","4916","10","Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers."
"2142","tt0042832","4916","11","Barbera Bel Geddis as Reed's wife has some good moments with Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of restful more than comic relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the New Orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer Joe McDonald."
"2143","tt0042832","4916","12","Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic."
"2144","tt0042832","4916","13","Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie Black Death. is simply outstanding."
"2145","tt0042832","4916","14","With riveting intensity Palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well."
"2146","tt0042832","4916","15","In addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity, especially in the film's powerful final allegorical moments."
"2147","tt0042832","4916","16","Panic in the Streets is probably Kazan's best non Brando film."
"2148","tt0042832","4916","17","It's tension filled, suspensefully well paced and edited."
"2149","tt0042832","4916","18","It's ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows Kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with Panic he succeeds with aplomb."
"2150","tt0042832","4917","1","'Panic in the Streets 1950' owes more to British noir that its American counterparts."
"2151","tt0042832","4917","2","Like Reed's 'The Third Man 1949' and Dassin's 'Night and the City 1950,' director Elia Kazan chose to film largely on location, capturing the fresh and vibrant decadence of the New Orleans slums."
"2152","tt0042832","4917","3","In a decision borrowed from the masters of Italian neorealism, he also hired many non professional actors for minor roles, lending an air of authenticity to the cityscape."
"2153","tt0042832","4917","4","However, any further comparisons with neorealism would be misguided, for 'Panic in the Streets' is pure melodrama, of the best kind."
"2154","tt0042832","4917","5","A murdered illegal immigrant, fished out of the bay, is found to be infected with pneumonic plague, a deadly air borne mutation of bubonic plague, which is transmitted from human to human and, untreated, has a mortality rate that approaches 100%."
"2155","tt0042832","4917","6","Clinton Reed Richard Widmark, an officer with the U.S."
"2156","tt0042832","4917","7","Public Health Service, convinces the doubtful police chief Paul Douglas to undertake a city wide manhunt for the men responsible for the homicide, lest they also be infected with the illness."
"2157","tt0042832","4917","8","In my younger years, I found Wolfgang Petersen's 'Outbreak 1995' to be among the most horrifying movies I'd ever seen."
"2158","tt0042832","4917","9","That thriller, which owes plenty to 'Panic in the Streets' working title: ""Outbreak"", terrified me so efficiently because it depicted the ebola virus as both an invisible and invincible killer  how does one defend themselves against such a thing."
"2159","tt0042832","4917","10","Kazan's film is the first that I know of to approach the subject of biological epidemics, though it has difficulty ascribing visual recognition to an enemy that is basically undetectable to the human eye; it instead uses Jack Palance as a human personification of the Plague."
"2160","tt0042832","4917","11","Despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society, you never get the sense that Clinton Reed is placing his own life at risk some viewers have noted that Reed never inoculated himself against the plague, though I think it's safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff."
"2161","tt0042832","4917","12","Nevertheless, there's still a strong sense of urgency in the hunt for the infected man's killers, underground street rats who pollute the sewers with their misdeeds."
"2162","tt0042832","4917","13","In medieval times, when the Black Death now widely believed to have been bubonic plague swept across the civilised world, killing a third of Europe's population, many identified the destruction as being the work of the Devil."
"2163","tt0042832","4917","14","Jack Palance's character, Blackie, serves effectively as Satan in human form: the angular jawed thug can occasionally be charming and charismatic, but is always liable to explode into fits of violence; his two hoodlums played by Guy Thomajan and Zero Mostel, through terror more than anything else, are constantly grovelling at his feet."
"2164","tt0042832","4917","15","When one lackey falls ill with fever, Blackie deduces that the man's immigrant cousin must have ""brought something in with him"" the irony of his conclusion not passing unnoticed, and so attempts to ascertain what this presumably valuable object must be."
"2165","tt0042832","4917","16","He cradles the dying Poldi in his arms, a grotesque display of faux affection that is both pathetic and unsettling."
"2166","tt0042832","4917","17","Blackie/Satan is finally stopped  not by the authorities, but by the burden of his own infection/evil  as he attempts to board a cargo ship, the primary vessel by which the Plague spread across Europe."
"2167","tt0042832","4918","1","As the film opens, two thugs kill another thug."
"2168","tt0042832","4918","2","When the body is discovered and about to be autopsied, the doctor realizes that although the man was shot dead, he was also suffering from the Pneumonic plague a very nasty and more virulent version of the Bubonic plague!"
"2169","tt0042832","4918","3","So, it's a race against time to find those who came in contact with the dead man and treat them immediately, otherwise a disaster could erupt."
"2170","tt0042832","4918","4","Oddly, I actually know quite a bit about the Pneumonic plague, as I taught a series of lectures on it for my history classes."
"2171","tt0042832","4918","5","The film really did not do a good job of getting the facts right about the disease in that it looked little like what the people had in the movie."
"2172","tt0042832","4918","6","The biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they really wouldn't have been allowed to show it."
"2173","tt0042832","4918","7","Sure, there is high fever and coughing they got this right but also lots of bleeding and explosive vomiting of blackened blood along with the enormously swollen lymph nodes like you'd get with the Bubonic plague all purply and gross!"
"2174","tt0042832","4918","8","I can certainly understand why they didn't go this far."
"2175","tt0042832","4918","9","Also, I am sure that the federal government would have had a much, much greater involvement in controlling and treating the disease here in the film it was handled on a very local level and everyone seemed ill prepared and a bit dumb."
"2176","tt0042832","4918","10","No one seemed willing to believe the doctors!!"
"2177","tt0042832","4918","11","As for the acting, the film had some excellent actors here."
"2178","tt0042832","4918","12","Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are, respectively, the public health doctor and police chief."
"2179","tt0042832","4918","13","Good actors but also known actors back in 1950."
"2180","tt0042832","4918","14","However, in his first film is the very menacing Jack Palance still going by his original moniker, 'Walter Jack Palance' as well as the relatively unknown at the time Zero Mostel."
"2181","tt0042832","4918","15","Palance was great very scary and very physically adept in his own stunts."
"2182","tt0042832","4918","16","Mostel played a heavy typical of his early work a greasy and cowardly sort of evil."
"2183","tt0042832","4918","17","Overall, despite really not getting the details right and wrapping everything up a little too neatly, the film is very tense and has excellent acting and is well worth seeing."
"2184","tt0042832","4919","1","Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar."
"2185","tt0042832","4919","2","Some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and rate it very highly."
"2186","tt0042832","4919","3","I can almost see where they are coming from."
"2187","tt0042832","4919","4","But I prefer to take a more toned down approach to a long forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi documentary fashion."
"2188","tt0042832","4919","5","Pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor Widmark and a city detective Douglas to apprehend the main carrier Palance."
"2189","tt0042832","4919","6","The film is moody, shot in stark black and white, and makes very good use of locations."
"2190","tt0042832","4919","7","Widmark is wonderful as usual."
"2191","tt0042832","4919","8","Forget the symbolism crime equals disease, and disease equals crime and just enjoy the chase."
"2192","tt0042832","4919","9","It is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short lived post WWII through the early 1950s and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher."
"2193","tt0042832","4919","10","For those who will be watching this for the first time, sit tight for the big chase at the end."
"2194","tt0042832","4919","11","It is something else, and frankly I don't know how they filmed some of it."
"2195","tt0042832","4919","12","I can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie."
"2196","tt0042832","4920","1","No, not really, but this is a very good film indeed, and is sadly a forgotten gem."
"2197","tt0042832","4920","2","Black and white suits the film."
"2198","tt0042832","4920","3","Straight forward formula, a guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before they die."
"2199","tt0042832","4920","4","Very well directed, and the acting is great."
"2200","tt0042832","4920","5","Richard Widmark as the male lead is good but is completely over shadowed in the acting stakes by Paul Douglas as the police captain, and Jack Palance never better than this and Zero Mostel as the baddies."
"2201","tt0042832","4920","6","Sadly Palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies."
"2202","tt0042832","4921","1","Like A Streetcar Named Desire also directed by Gadg both on stage and screen Panic In The Streets depicts a New Orleans in which its major claim to fame the birthplace of Jazz doesn't even rate a mention."
"2203","tt0042832","4921","2","It was Richard Widmark's seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer."
"2204","tt0042832","4921","3","Gadg himself appears in an uncredited small role as a morgue attendant but the film is rich in talent beginning with Jack Palance still being billed as Walter Jack Palanceas the local Mr 'Big' followed side kick Zero Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig plus the rock solid ever reliable Paul Douglas as the cop who comes round to doc Widmark's point of view."
"2205","tt0042832","4921","4","It's a very rewarding movie more so for being little seen."
"2206","tt0042832","4921","5","Catch it if you can."
"2207","tt0042832","4922","1","I wonder what audiences of the day thought when first laying eyes on Walter Jack Palance Blackie."
"2208","tt0042832","4922","2","Certainly he looks like no one else of the time, that skull like face, flattened nose, and elongated body even now he remains an unsettling presence."
"2209","tt0042832","4922","3","And what could be more appropriate than his emergence out of those dingy New Orleans slums that appear to fester like the plague Blackie is loosing on the city."
"2210","tt0042832","4922","4","I'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes."
"2211","tt0042832","4922","5","The movie itself is very skillfully assembled the morgue's black humor, the Widmark Douglas interplay, the un touristy locations, the battles among officialsall are woven into a tensely realistic thriller with a menace unlike others of the time."
"2212","tt0042832","4922","6","Even Widmark's domestic scenes that put a woman Bel Geddes on the marquee manage not to be too disruptive."
"2213","tt0042832","4922","7","Director Kazan certainly shows his aptitude for helming a studio Fox product, no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspect."
"2214","tt0042832","4922","8","Widmark does a solid low key job as the public health officer."
"2215","tt0042832","4922","9","But my money is on the one and only Zero Mostel."
"2216","tt0042832","4922","10","Was there ever a sweatier performer who could squeal louder or get pushed around more than the bulky fall guy e.g."
"2217","tt0042832","4922","11","The Enforcer, 1950."
"2218","tt0042832","4922","12","That scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with Mostel's shrewish wife Liswood, is a gem of frantic subservience as Mostel tries to pacify each like some berserk pinball."
"2219","tt0042832","4922","13","Too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist."
"2220","tt0042832","4922","14","I wonder if it was the voluble Kazan who named him."
"2221","tt0042832","4922","15","But it's not only the professionals that add color."
"2222","tt0042832","4922","16","The locals add both character and authenticity, especially the two Asian guys interviewed by the cops."
"2223","tt0042832","4922","17","That whole scene has an improvised air, as if Kazan recognized their potential and fashioned a nifty little scene on the spot."
"2224","tt0042832","4922","18","Then too, that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration."
"2225","tt0042832","4922","19","And what about those flea bitten coffee shops that have me running to the nearest Denny's."
"2226","tt0042832","4922","20","Anyway, the movie is still a well staged, riveting thriller with an apocalyptic air that oddly foreshadows many of today's mega hits."
"2227","tt0042832","4923","1","""Panic In The Streets"" is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director Elia Kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in New Orleans, using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation."
"2228","tt0042832","4923","2","As a result, the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable."
"2229","tt0042832","4923","3","An important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster, provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken, then increase the tension to a high level."
"2230","tt0042832","4923","4","Following a dispute between the participants in a card game, a man called Kochak Lewis Charles is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area."
"2231","tt0042832","4923","5","When the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus, U.S."
"2232","tt0042832","4923","6","Public Health official Dr Clinton Reed Richard Widmark is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague."
"2233","tt0042832","4923","7","Reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action, anyone infected could be expected to die within days."
"2234","tt0042832","4923","8","As the identity of the dead man is unknown, the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the Police Commissioner are not fully convinced by Reed's briefing."
"2235","tt0042832","4923","9","They doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently."
"2236","tt0042832","4923","10","The investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community, a group of seamen, the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man's identity and his contacts are eventually found."
"2237","tt0042832","4923","11","Kochak, an illegal immigrant, had been in a gang with Blackie Jack Palance, Raymond Fitch Zero Mostel and Vince Poldi Tommy Cook and when gang leader Blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation, he presumes that Kochak must've smuggled something very valuable into the country."
"2238","tt0042832","4923","12","As Kochak and Poldi were related, Blackie assumes that Poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more."
"2239","tt0042832","4923","13","Poldi, however, is very ill and unable to provide any information."
"2240","tt0042832","4923","14","Blackie brings in his own doctor and together with Fitch starts to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed and an exciting chase follows."
"2241","tt0042832","4923","15","Richard Widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man."
"2242","tt0042832","4923","16","In an unusual type of role for him, he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of Dr Reed very convincingly."
"2243","tt0042832","4923","17","Jack Palance's film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges Kochak's reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation."
"2244","tt0042832","4923","18","His distinctive looks also help to make his on screen presence even more compelling."
"2245","tt0042832","4923","19","In typical docu noir style, expressionist cinematography and neo realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place."
"2246","tt0042832","4923","20","Elia Kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside."
"2247","tt0042832","4924","1","A doctor and a policeman in New Orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague."
"2248","tt0042832","4924","2","An effective, and classy, little thriller directed by Elia Kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat."
"2249","tt0042832","4924","3","Set and filmed in and around New Orleans, Panic In The Streets is taken from the story Quarantine, Some Like 'em Cold by Edna and Edward Anhalt who won an Oscar for original story."
"2250","tt0042832","4924","4","It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director."
"2251","tt0042832","4924","5","In turn, Richard Widmark bringing the method a year before Marlon did for Kazan in A Streetcar Named Desire, Paul Douglas, Jack Palance as Walter Jack Palance & the wonderfully named Zero Mostel, all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential Black Death epidemic."
"2252","tt0042832","4924","6","Where the film scores its main suspense points is with Kazan's astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece."
"2253","tt0042832","4924","7","From Widmark's Public Health doctor, with hypodermic needle in hand, running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good; to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them; the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point."
"2254","tt0042832","4924","8","To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema."
"2255","tt0042832","4924","9","With Palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of Widmark's own Tommy Udo from Kiss Of Death three years prior."
"2256","tt0042832","4924","10","It's an imaginative and intelligently written story, one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease."
"2257","tt0042832","4924","11","A blight on society as it were."
"2258","tt0042832","4924","12","It's noirish elements, such as paranoia, blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being."
"2259","tt0042832","4924","13","While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created."
"2260","tt0042832","4924","14","Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway, this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end."
"2261","tt0042832","4924","15","Not essential film noir, and maybe not even essential Kazan, but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day."
"2262","tt0042832","4924","16","7.5/10"
"2263","tt0042832","4925","1","A neat 'race against time' premise A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them."
"2264","tt0042832","4925","2","This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it's well worth downloading."
"2265","tt0042832","4925","3","A lot all. of this movie was filmed in genuine New Orleans locations, which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail, though to me it does look under exposed, even for noir maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are."
"2266","tt0042832","4925","4","There is also a plenty of location background noise, which is slightly distracting car horns in the love scene, anyone."
"2267","tt0042832","4925","5","There are a lot of non professional supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with not much chance for retakes or recasting, though the final chase is worth hanging on for."
"2268","tt0042832","4925","6","There's not much wrong with the lead actors either: Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific, while Widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level most of the time."
"2269","tt0042832","4925","7","Somebody should remake this no supernaturals, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good yarn full of character conflict, and a topical theme."
"2270","tt0042832","4925","8","Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types peppering this dark, sleazy, against the clock drama."
"2271","tt0042832","4925","9","There's even a midget newspaper seller."""
"2272","tt0042832","4925","10","Community."
"2273","tt0042832","4925","11","What community."
"2274","tt0042832","4925","12","D'you think you're living in the Middle Ages."""
"2275","tt0042832","4926","1","Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors this country ever had, showed he was equally at home with movies."
"2276","tt0042832","4926","2","With ""Panic in the Streets"", Mr."
"2277","tt0042832","4926","3","Kazan gives us an early version of what would come later, with perhaps his master piece, ""On the Waterfront"", although both movies share only the water setting, for they are different visions about different subjects."
"2278","tt0042832","4926","4","Mr."
"2279","tt0042832","4926","5","Kazan shot on location in New Orleans."
"2280","tt0042832","4926","6","The adaptation by Daniel Fuchs of the Edna and Edward Anhalt stories that are the basis of the film, is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting ""The Big Easy""."
"2281","tt0042832","4926","7","One of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by Joseph MacDonald that shows New Orleans at its best."
"2282","tt0042832","4926","8","Also the music by Alfred Newman and the song by Billie Holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch."
"2283","tt0042832","4926","9","This film, could have been shot in New York, or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like ""broklynese"" than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country."
"2284","tt0042832","4926","10","One thing comes clear in the movie, Jack Palance, making his screen debut, smolders the screen every time one sees him."
"2285","tt0042832","4926","11","He was so intense!"
"2286","tt0042832","4926","12","At the same time, this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner, who unknown to him, is stricken with a fatal disease."
"2287","tt0042832","4926","13","Blackie, comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man's greasy hair with abandon."
"2288","tt0042832","4926","14","Notable also, was the fact that Mr."
"2289","tt0042832","4926","15","Palance and Mr."
"2290","tt0042832","4926","16","Mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts, something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real."
"2291","tt0042832","4926","17","The film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film."
"2292","tt0042832","4926","18","We see a family man painting furniture with his young son."
"2293","tt0042832","4926","19","Later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his salary, something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis."
"2294","tt0042832","4926","20","Richard Widmark, playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people."
"2295","tt0042832","4926","21","Barbara Bel Geddes, as the wife, sounds as though she's a suburban woman from Connecticut."
"2296","tt0042832","4926","22","The film is enjoyable thanks to Mr."
"2297","tt0042832","4926","23","Kazan's direction and the excellent cast working in the movie."
"2298","tt0042832","4927","1","Just a comment on New Orleans accents..."
"2299","tt0042832","4927","2","An earlier reviewer noted the following: ""This film, could have been shot in New York, or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like ""broklynese"" than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country."""
"2300","tt0042832","4927","3","There was also another comment along these lines from an English reviewer."
"2301","tt0042832","4927","4","Many people in New Orleans do, in fact, sound ""broklynese""."
"2302","tt0042832","4927","5","I have never found out why."
"2303","tt0042832","4927","6","It's mentioned in ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" by John Kennedy Toole."
"2304","tt0042832","4927","7","I always appreciate movies taking place in New Orleans that include this detail, as this one did."
"2305","tt0042832","4927","8","Too often it's just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent."
"2306","tt0042832","4928","1","Given its time of release, the story that unravels in 1950 thriller 'Panic in the Streets' was hardly a surprise."
"2307","tt0042832","4928","2","The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague."
"2308","tt0042832","4928","3","Yet with the current drama in the world today, this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers."
"2309","tt0042832","4928","4","The cast and crew are flawless."
"2310","tt0042832","4928","5","Richard Widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in 'Night and the City,' Jack Palance in his chilling film debut, also starring in this film are Paul Douglas and a young and rather cute Barbara Bel Geddes."
"2311","tt0042832","4928","6","A whole slew of uncredited, non professional actors typical of director Kazan fill in the remaining slots."
"2312","tt0042832","4928","7","Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald films he would later work with Richard Widmark again in 1953's much superior 'Pickup on South Street' and the great Alfred Newman scores it."
"2313","tt0042832","4928","8","Nearly everyone involved here has done better work, 'Panic in the Streets' is quite the rewarding watch, nonetheless."
"2314","tt0042832","4928","9","Especially for the film noir enthusiast."
"2315","tt0042832","4929","1","I can't really condemn the movie because it does work."
"2316","tt0042832","4929","2","There is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie, but I think it's only just in the category."
"2317","tt0042832","4929","3","There's nothing sinister in this piece, and that's where the noir elements fail."
"2318","tt0042832","4929","4","Sure, the disease might be considered sinister, but I have a hard time seeing that."
"2319","tt0042832","4929","5","The movie hints at a darker side: Blackie may be trafficking human beings, the New Orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter, the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie... but those are really only hints."
"2320","tt0042832","4929","6","There's no attempt made to question Reed's motivations, as one with do with Marlowe or Spade, nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to Blackie, which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played out."
"2321","tt0042832","4929","7","That lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end."
"2322","tt0042832","4929","8","The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and direction are well done... but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over."
"2323","tt0042832","4929","9","Worth watching once, maybe twice if you don't remember it from years ago, and then putting away."
"2324","tt0042832","4930","1","""Panic in the Streets"" was a decent thriller, but I felt a bit disappointed by it."
"2325","tt0042832","4930","2","The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never really explores or develops it."
"2326","tt0042832","4930","3","Its well made and entertaining, but its not as interesting as it should have been."
"2327","tt0042832","4930","4","The screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down."
"2328","tt0042832","4930","5","None of the central characters are really compelling or believable."
"2329","tt0042832","4930","6","Fortunately, the film is very well made so it compensates for the weak scripting."
"2330","tt0042832","4930","7","The direction by Elia Kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace."
"2331","tt0042832","4930","8","There are some standout sequences, particularly the memorable chase climax."
"2332","tt0042832","4930","9","When his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later, the man could mostly do no wrong."
"2333","tt0042832","4930","10","The acting is also very good."
"2334","tt0042832","4930","11","Richard Widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character."
"2335","tt0042832","4930","12","Paul Douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well."
"2336","tt0042832","4930","13","The standouts in the cast are the two villains."
"2337","tt0042832","4930","14","Zero Mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, is effectively slimy as one of cinema's ultimate toady characters."
"2338","tt0042832","4930","15","Jack Palance is, unsurprisingly, a chilling villain."
"2339","tt0042832","4930","16","""Panic in the Streets"" is disappointing but still worth watching."
"2340","tt0042832","4930","17","7/10"
"2341","tt0042832","4931","1","When plague breaks out in New Orleans, it's Richard Widmark to the rescue in ""Panic in the Streets,"" one of the lesser celebrated films of the great Elia Kazan."
"2342","tt0042832","4931","2","Kazan keeps the pace brisk, and there are lots of marvelous touches the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens, which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low lifes, portrayed by a menacing Jack Palance, his weak yes man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook, and Louis Charles."
"2343","tt0042832","4931","3","There are also some interesting visuals Palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height."
"2344","tt0042832","4931","4","The acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isn't quite up to the direction and performances."
"2345","tt0042832","4931","5","It has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily."
"2346","tt0042832","4931","6","That aside, it's well worth viewing."
"2347","tt0042832","4931","7","Kazan was a masterful director."
"2348","tt0042832","4932","1","In Panic In The Streets Richard Widmark plays U.S."
"2349","tt0042832","4932","2","Navy doctor who has his week rudely interrupted with a corpse that contains plague."
"2350","tt0042832","4932","3","As cop Paul Douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest."
"2351","tt0042832","4932","4","That's not the issue here, the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease."
"2352","tt0042832","4932","5","As was pointed out by any number of people, for some reason director Elia Kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like they're from Louisiana."
"2353","tt0042832","4932","6","Having been to New Orleans where the story takes place I can personally attest to that."
"2354","tt0042832","4932","7","Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be excused because as a Navy doctor he could be assigned there, but for those that are natives it doesn't work."
"2355","tt0042832","4932","8","But with plague out there and the news being kept a secret, the New Orleans PD starts a dragnet of the city's underworld."
"2356","tt0042832","4932","9","The dead guy came off a ship from Europe and he had underworld connections."
"2357","tt0042832","4932","10","A New Orleans wise guy played by Jack Palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague symptoms."
"2358","tt0042832","4932","11","Palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received notice."
"2359","tt0042832","4932","12","Personally my favorite in this film is Zero Mostel."
"2360","tt0042832","4932","13","This happened right before Mostel was blacklisted and around that time he made a specialty of playing would be tough guys who are really toadies."
"2361","tt0042832","4932","14","He plays the same kind of role in the Humphrey Bogart film, The Enforcer."
"2362","tt0042832","4932","15","Sadly I can kind of identify with Mostel in that last chase scene where he and Palance are being chased down by Widmark, Douglas, and half the New Orleans Police."
"2363","tt0042832","4932","16","Seeing the weight challenged Zero trying to keep up with Palance was something else because I'm kind of in Zero's league now in the heft department."
"2364","tt0042832","4932","17","Kazan kept the action going at a good clip, there's very little down time in this film."
"2365","tt0042832","4932","18","If there was any less it would be an Indiana Jones film."
"2366","tt0042832","4932","19","Panic In The Streets won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay that year."
"2367","tt0042832","4932","20","Kazan also made good use of the New Orleans waterfront and the French Quarter."
"2368","tt0042832","4932","21","Some of the same kinds of shots are later used in On the Waterfront."
"2369","tt0042832","4932","22","In fact Panic In The Streets is about people not squealing when they really should in their own best interest."
"2370","tt0042832","4932","23","Very similar again to On the Waterfront."
"2371","tt0042832","4932","24","Panic In The Streets does everyone proud who was associated with it."

"2378","tt0042832","4933","6","You know how it will likely end, but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout."
"2379","tt0042832","4933","7","The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see."

"2381","tt0042832","4934","1","""Panic in the Streets"" is a fairly unknown little movie from director Elia Kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", ""On the Waterfront"" and ""East of Eden""."
"2382","tt0042832","4934","2","Kazan already won an Oscar in 1947, before this movie, so he was not a completely unknown at the time."
"2383","tt0042832","4934","3","Still ""Panic in the Streets"" is mostly a movie that passed under the radar."
"2384","tt0042832","4934","4","The great thing about this movie is the Oscar winning script."
"2385","tt0042832","4934","5","It has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime/film noir elements."
"2386","tt0042832","4934","6","The dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent and gives the movie a feel of reality and credibility."
"2387","tt0042832","4934","7","The cast is fairly unknown especially at the time it was released but it still features Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first movie roles."
"2388","tt0042832","4934","8","Especially Palance impresses as the tough gangster boss, with a very powerful looking face."
"2389","tt0042832","4934","9","Still the movie drags a little at some points."
"2390","tt0042832","4934","10","The movie starts of very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always makes the right decisions in terms of pace and the point of view the story is told from."
"2391","tt0042832","4934","11","Yet, ""Panic in the Streets"" remains a perfectly watchable movie, mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch."
"2392","tt0042832","4934","12","For fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch.8/10"

"2402","tt0042832","4935","10","Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive."

"2410","tt0042832","4936","6","While Panic in the Streets is a quality film, it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling my reason for bringing the score down to an eight."
"2411","tt0042832","4936","7","It wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster, police procedural, thriller and even romance."
"2412","tt0042832","4936","8","This is not director Elia Kazan's best work, but saying that is a bit disingenuous."
"2413","tt0042832","4936","9","Kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire 1951, On The Waterfront 1954 and East of Eden 1955, after all."
"2414","tt0042832","4936","10","This film predates those, but Kazan has said that he was already ""untethered"" by the studio."
"2415","tt0042832","4936","11","Taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl."
"2416","tt0042832","4936","12","The film is set in New Orleans, a city where Kazan ""used to wander around . . . night and day so I knew it well""."
"2417","tt0042832","4936","13","He wanted to exploit the environment."
"2418","tt0042832","4936","14","""It's so terrific and colorful."

"2420","tt0042832","4936","16","Kazan handles each genre of Panic in the Streets well, but they could be connected better."
"2421","tt0042832","4936","17","The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods."
"2422","tt0042832","4936","18","The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked."
"2423","tt0042832","4936","19","Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, ""Quarantine"" and ""Some Like 'Em Cold""."
"2424","tt0042832","4936","20","The gangster material, which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film, is probably the highlight."
"2425","tt0042832","4936","21","Not surprisingly, Kazan has said that he believes the villains are ""more colorful I never had much affection for the good guys anyway."
"2426","tt0042832","4936","22","I don't like puritans""."
"2427","tt0042832","4936","23","A close second is the only material that approaches the ""panic"" of the title the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed, inoculate them and contain the disease."
"2428","tt0042832","4936","24","While there is plenty of suspense during these two ""moods"", much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama, with pacing more typical of that genre."
"2429","tt0042832","4936","25","The dialogue throughout is excellent."
"2430","tt0042832","4936","26","The stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced."
"2431","tt0042832","4936","27","It is intelligent, delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character."
"2432","tt0042832","4936","28","Conflict isn't created by ""dumb"" decisions but smart moves; events and characters' actions are more like a chess game."
"2433","tt0042832","4936","29","When unusual stances are taken, such as Reed withholding the plague from the newspapers, he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions, which other characters argue over."
"2434","tt0042832","4936","30","In light of this, it's interesting that Kazan believed that ""propriety, religion, ethics and the middle class are all murdering us""."
"2435","tt0042832","4936","31","That idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm, or allowances away from it, made by the protagonists."
"2436","tt0042832","4936","32","For example, head gangster Blackie Jack Palance in his first film role is offered a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card if he'll cooperate with combating the plague."
"2437","tt0042832","4936","33","The technical aspects of the film are fine, if nothing exceptional, but the real reasons to watch are the performances, the intriguing scenario and the well written dialogue."
"2438","tt0042832","4937","1","This film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio terrorism, and the threats of superbugs, West Nile Virus, and SARS."
"2439","tt0042832","4937","2","As a thriller, the tension is fairly intense."
"2440","tt0042832","4937","3","Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than serviceable in their roles."
"2441","tt0042832","4937","4","The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot."
"2442","tt0042832","4937","5","The actor in this film who most left his mark is Jack Palance."
"2443","tt0042832","4937","6","His sharply defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface."
"2444","tt0042832","4937","7","The chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today."
"2445","tt0042832","4937","8","Recommended, 7/10."
"2446","tt0042832","4938","1","Panic In The Streets opens in high noir style, a view along a dark street followed by a camera tilt upwards to a window, behind which is playing out a sleazy card game an opening flourish which, along with some of the location shooting, anticipates some of the atmosphere Welles brought a decade later in Touch Of Evil."
"2447","tt0042832","4938","2","One of the players throws open the window; it's an appropriate action, serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworld."
"2448","tt0042832","4938","3","Shot in high contrast black and white, Panic In The Streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in New Orleans."
"2449","tt0042832","4938","4","Scenes set in such places as the mortuary, the crowded shipping office or amidst the peeling paint of 'Frank's Place' offer a unique, and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere, impossible to recreate in the studio."
"2450","tt0042832","4938","5","With these elements, Kazan's film shows the influence of Dassin's groundbreaking Naked City of two years earlier, which established the gritty, almost documentary style within the noir cycle."
"2451","tt0042832","4938","6","In fact, Widmark's previous role had been in Dassin's even finer Night And The City, a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent."
"2452","tt0042832","4938","7","Joe MacDonald, a favourite with the director, photographed Panic In The Streets' detailed environment."
"2453","tt0042832","4938","8","MacDonald also worked on Kazan's Pinky and Viva Zapata!, and went on to shoot Widmark again three years later in Fuller's masterpiece Pick Up On South Street."
"2454","tt0042832","4938","9","As others have noticed, in a manner typical of some noir films, Kazan's work offers a contrast between the confusion, sickness and immorality of the streets with the modest, calm home life of the Reeds."
"2455","tt0042832","4938","10","But whereas for instance in Lang's The Big Heat 1953 the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the embattled central character ultimately sending him back to work with an increased vigilance and sense of vengeance Panic In The Streets places Reed's rising anxiousness within the confines of what amounts to just another working 'day'."
"2456","tt0042832","4938","11","Despite all the danger, ultimately he returns back to the bosom of his family justified and satisfied."
"2457","tt0042832","4938","12","The implication being that social balance has been restored, at least for the moment by his professionalism and curative skills."
"2458","tt0042832","4938","13","That imbalance of course, has been created by crime and disease."
"2459","tt0042832","4938","14","The two are closely associated in this film."
"2460","tt0042832","4938","15","It reminds one of the tagline from the much cruder Cobra 1986 where ""Crime is the disease."
"2461","tt0042832","4938","16","Meet the cure,"" a neat analogy in context, if one which rings too uncomfortably of social reductionism."
"2462","tt0042832","4938","17","At its climax, as Blackie attempts to flee aboard ship, the visuals specifically allude to rats as being similar to criminals, both posing a menace to society's health."
"2463","tt0042832","4938","18","As the presumably infected Blackie prowls round the cheap rooms and the docks with his cronies, in search of something he suspects everyone is after, if without knowing exactly what it is, 'plague' and 'Blackie' resonate together in the audiences mind, adding further to connected associations."
"2464","tt0042832","4938","19","Ironically Blackie's hunch about Poldi's unfortunate cousin, that ""he brought something in"" of note is correct even if, finally, its nothing he can sell or steal."
"2465","tt0042832","4938","20","Blackie's logical assumption that the police would not normally bother with the murder of some anonymous illegal immigrant has a ring of truth about it, and his so confusion is understandable."
"2466","tt0042832","4938","21","Dr Reed, although home loving, and on the side of society, is a true noir hero."
"2467","tt0042832","4938","22","Familiar to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man who walks alone, forced to travel beyond the limits of the law."
"2468","tt0042832","4938","23","In his way, Reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society at large a dimension of the film that is particularly apposite, given director Kazan's controversial personal history."
"2469","tt0042832","4938","24","The director testified before the infamous HUAC, naming suspected communists and fellow travellers."
"2470","tt0042832","4938","25","His film depicts suspects being hauled in for questioning, and the manhandling of the press, on the grounds that the overriding public good justified the means."
"2471","tt0042832","4938","26","These actions perhaps echo the director's sentiments at the time, presumably accepting the McCarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights it entailed in the light of presumed communist infiltration of the entertainment industry."
"2472","tt0042832","4938","27","In these times of terrorist threats and state response, such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modern."
"2473","tt0042832","4938","28","Standout scenes in the film include a notable scene where Blackie interrogates the dying Poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin's presumed contraband."
"2474","tt0042832","4938","29","Cat like, Blackie stalks his victim across the room, eventually preying over the doomed man's sick bed, holding Poldi's feverish head in his hands a striking, evil cradling."
"2475","tt0042832","4938","30","It's a gesture emphasising the intimate nature of corruption, whether moral or physical."
"2476","tt0042832","4938","31","Apparently, the actors did many or all of their own stunts, which leads to some other, very dramatic scenes at the end, as the police and health authorities close in on the villains under the wharfs."
"2477","tt0042832","4938","32","Half crawling, half scrambling over the slippery timbers at the edge of the dock pool must have been an experience very uncomfortable for Palance, but it is sequence that adds immensely to the immediacy of it all."
"2478","tt0042832","4938","33","Occasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer."
"2479","tt0042832","4938","34","Apparently Dr Reed is left to fight a potential national emergency little government backup."
"2480","tt0042832","4938","35","Perhaps just as astonishingly, he never inoculates himself inviting a dramatic turn which never materialises."
"2481","tt0042832","4938","36","At the end of the film, too, the potential epidemic has been halted, all contactees located, a little too neatly."
"2482","tt0042832","4938","37","But these weaknesses are more than outweighed by the other satisfactions of a film that still makes for compulsive and relevant viewing today."
"2483","tt0043132","6737","1","The director and two stars of LAURA 1944 were reteamed for this solid policier: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while interrogating suspects and, one night, he goes too far; Gene Tierney is the estranged wife of his victim, a decorated war hero who has become involved with the town's leading racketeer and Andrews' No. 1 nemesis, Gary Merrill who had himself been the protégé of Andrews Snr.!"
"2484","tt0043132","6737","2","As usual with Preminger, this is a well crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and enlivened by a good cast that also includes Karl Malden as Andrews' incumbent superior, Tom Tully as Tierney's motor mouth taxi driver dad and Neville Brand as Merrill's chief thug, with notable support also coming from Craig Stevens as the slimy, wife beating victim, Bert Freed as Andrews' sympathetic partner and Robert F."
"2485","tt0043132","6737","3","Nolan as Andrews' stern outgoing superior."
"2486","tt0043132","6737","4","Having already been warned by the latter to mend his ways or else, Andrews panics and impersonates Stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the in this case wrong tracks of Merrill; however, after Tully becomes the prime suspect by which time Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved, the cop goes by himself in Merrill's lair fully intending to get bumped off and 'frame' the racketeer for his own murder!"
"2487","tt0043132","6737","5","Clearly, the protagonist is a complex character and Andrews rises to the challenge with a first rate characterization that is typically complemented by the in house Fox noir style."
"2488","tt0043132","6738","1","Where the Sidewalk Ends is quite a good film noir crime drama and is shot well in black and white and on location as well."
"2489","tt0043132","6738","2","A copper accidentally kills a bloke who is suspected of murder and to protect himself, he covers this up and blames it on another person he doesn't like who has committed a lot of crimes in the past."
"2490","tt0043132","6738","3","But towards the end, he owns up but not before falling in love with a woman he meets who is the lover of the person he killed..."
"2491","tt0043132","6738","4","The cast includes Dana Andrews While the City Sleeps, Curse of the Demon, Gene Tierney Laura, The Ghost and Mrs Muir, Gary Merrill Mysterious Island, Karl Malden The Streets of San Francisco, Beyond the Posidon Adventure and Craig Stevens The Deadly Mantis."
"2492","tt0043132","6738","5","Good parts from all."
"2493","tt0043132","6738","6","Where the Sidewalk Ends is worth checking out if you get the chance."
"2494","tt0043132","6738","7","Excellent."
"2495","tt0043132","6738","8","Rating: 3 stars out of 5."
"2496","tt0043132","6739","1","""Film noir"" is an overused expression when it comes to describing films."
"2497","tt0043132","6739","2","Every crime drama seems to be a ""noir""."
"2498","tt0043132","6739","3","But ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" really is a good example of what the genre is all about."
"2499","tt0043132","6739","4","Very briefly, an overzealous detective Andrews accidentally kills a no goodnik who works for the mobsters."
"2500","tt0043132","6739","5","The killing is blamed on the father Tom Tully of a woman Andrews meets and falls for Tierney."
"2501","tt0043132","6739","6","To save Dad from Old Sparky, Andrews captures the rest of the mob and turns himself in."
"2502","tt0043132","6739","7","The morally guilty cop is driven by impulses from the past."
"2503","tt0043132","6739","8","His father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail."
"2504","tt0043132","6739","9","But that doesn't excuse his actions after he accidentally offs the no goodnik in self defense."
"2505","tt0043132","6739","10","He immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but he hesitates."
"2506","tt0043132","6739","11","He's already in hot water with the department and this could finish his career."
"2507","tt0043132","6739","12","Then, at just the wrong moment, the phone rings."
"2508","tt0043132","6739","13","It's Andrews' partner and Andrews tells him the suspect they're trailing isn't at home."
"2509","tt0043132","6739","14","He hides the body and later disposes of it by slugging a watchman and dumping the body in the river."
"2510","tt0043132","6739","15","What motivates a guy to do something so dumb."
"2511","tt0043132","6739","16","Okay."
"2512","tt0043132","6739","17","His job was at risk."
"2513","tt0043132","6739","18","But now he's committed multiple felonies."
"2514","tt0043132","6739","19","At least I think they must be multiple."
"2515","tt0043132","6739","20","I counted obstruction of justice, assault, disposing of a body without a permit, littering, first degree mopery, and bearing false witness against his neighbor."
"2516","tt0043132","6739","21","In the end, we don't know whether to root for Andrews or not."
"2517","tt0043132","6739","22","The suspect didn't deserve to die, true, but it was after all an accident because Andrews didn't know he was a war hero and ""had a silver plate in his head."""
"2518","tt0043132","6739","23","Maybe it's that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was, among other things such as characteristic lighting."
"2519","tt0043132","6739","24","If noir involved nothing more than black and white photography, murder, criminals, mystery, and suspicious women, then we'd have to include all the Charlie Chan movies under that rubric."
"2520","tt0043132","6739","25","Andrews is pretty good."
"2521","tt0043132","6739","26","He's a kind of Mark MacPherson from ""Laura"" gone bitter."
"2522","tt0043132","6739","27","He never laughs, and rarely smiles, even when seated across a restaurant table from Gene Tierney, a situation likely to prompt smiles in many men."
"2523","tt0043132","6739","28","He has no sense of humor at all."
"2524","tt0043132","6739","29","His few wisecracks are put downs."
"2525","tt0043132","6739","30","When he shoves a stoolie into a cab and the stoolie says, ""Careful."
"2526","tt0043132","6739","31","I almost hit my head,"" Andrews' riposte is, ""That's okay."
"2527","tt0043132","6739","32","The cab's insured."""
"2528","tt0043132","6739","33","Andrews could seem kind of wooden at times but this is a role that calls for stubborn and humorless determination and he handles it well."
"2529","tt0043132","6739","34","His underplaying is perfect for the part."
"2530","tt0043132","6739","35","Little twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states."
"2531","tt0043132","6739","36","And I guess the director, Otto Preminger, stopped him from pronouncing bullet as ""BOO let"" and police as ""POE lice."""
"2532","tt0043132","6739","37","Never could make up my mind about Gene Tierney."
"2533","tt0043132","6739","38","She does alright in the role of Tom Tully's daughter, a model, but she's like Marilyn Monroe in that you can't separate the adopted mannerisms from the real personality traits."
"2534","tt0043132","6739","39","Did Tierney actually have such an innocent, almost saintly persona."
"2535","tt0043132","6739","40","When she answered the phone at home, did her voice have the same sing along quality that it has on screen."
"2536","tt0043132","6739","41","Poor Tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff, before there were any effective meds for bipolar disorder."
"2537","tt0043132","6739","42","And Andrews too, nice guy though he appears to have been, slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcements."

"2644","tt0043132","6746","7","There's a lot more to the film than this including a plot involving a slimy villain Gary Merrill and a love interest for Andrews Gene Tierney."
"2645","tt0043132","6746","8","All in all, this is one of the better examples of the genre with great gritty dialog, superb lighting and a simple yet very effective story."
"2646","tt0043132","6746","9","This is the way Noir was meant to be."
"2647","tt0043132","6747","1","'Where the Sidewalk Ends 1950' opens, appropriately, with Dana Andrews' and Gene Tierneys' names inscribed on the sidewalk, as dirty water streams down between the bars of a sewer grate."
"2648","tt0043132","6747","2","The sidewalk represents respectability, integrity and morality  only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter."
"2649","tt0043132","6747","3","But even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion, and, when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end, sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting one's shoes wet."
"2650","tt0043132","6747","4","Mark Dixon Dana Andrews was born in the gutter, his father a professional criminal, and has spent his entire life clawing his way back onto the sidewalk, perpetually balanced on the edge of the kerb."
"2651","tt0043132","6747","5","As a police detective, Dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked, but he possesses a mean streak that he can't escape."
"2652","tt0043132","6747","6","When his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead, Dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he despised, a cheap criminal who'll cheat and lie to cover up his offence.'"
"2653","tt0043132","6747","7","Where the Sidewalk Ends' was the only film to reunite Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney and director Otto Preminger after the superb 'Laura 1944,' though the two films, as far as noir goes, couldn't be further apart."
"2654","tt0043132","6747","8","Whereas the earlier picture had the strong intimacy of a country house murder tale, this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama."
"2655","tt0043132","6747","9","Given her ravishingly memorable performance as Laura Hunt, it's unfortunate that here Tierney is grossly underused, occupying the typical niche of the pretty, helpless romantic interest much as she did that same year in Jules Dassin's 'The Night and the City 1950'."
"2656","tt0043132","6747","10","Andrews, on the other hand, has rarely been better, exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that I hadn't expected of him."
"2657","tt0043132","6747","11","Gary Merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss Scalise, but he doesn't seem mean enough for the role, and I think that an actor like Richard Conte who played Mr."
"2658","tt0043132","6747","12","Brown in 'The Big Combo 1955' would have better suited the character; I hadn't realised this, but Conte appeared just one year earlier in Preminger's 'Whirlpool 1949.'"
"2659","tt0043132","6747","13","The tension, as Dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime, is absolutely riveting  certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era  though I feel that the situation still wasn't exploited to its full potential."
"2660","tt0043132","6747","14","The taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified Dixon as the perpetrator, but Preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes Dixon on the stairs."
"2661","tt0043132","6747","15","Had the witness been brought in as Dixon was re enacting his own movements outside the apartment entrance, we could have had some genuine fireworks."
"2662","tt0043132","6747","16","And why, for that matter, couldn't the taxi driver's testimony have immediately absolved Jiggs Taylor Tom Tully from suspicion of murder."
"2663","tt0043132","6747","17","Niggling inconsistencies such as these tarnish an otherwise excellent screenplay from Ben Hecht, who infuses his gritty criminal underworld with hard hitting cops and wise cracking felons."
"2664","tt0043132","6747","18","Andrews' seething and implosive law enforcer, tormented by rage and remorse, has rarely been done better, at least the equal of Robert Ryan in Nicholas Ray's 'On Dangerous Ground 1952.'"
"2665","tt0043132","6748","1","New York police detective Mark Dixon Dana Andrews is a guy who has to deal with his own demons on a daily basis at the same time as coping with the normal ups and downs of everyday life."
"2666","tt0043132","6748","2","The strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals, leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law."
"2667","tt0043132","6748","3","He has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used."
"2668","tt0043132","6748","4","Dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals."
"2669","tt0043132","6748","5","He is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his father's reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence."
"2670","tt0043132","6748","6","When a rich Texan is murdered following an evening's gambling run by gangster Tommy Scalise Gary Merrill, Dixon is assigned to the case."
"2671","tt0043132","6748","7","Scalise tells Dixon's superior officer Detective Lieutenant Thomas Karl Malden that the victim had been accompanied by Ken Paine Craig Stevens and his wife Morgan Gene Tierney and that Paine had committed the murder."
"2672","tt0043132","6748","8","Dixon goes to Paine's apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when Paine punches him, Dixon retaliates and Paine collapses and dies."
"2673","tt0043132","6748","9","Dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river."
"2674","tt0043132","6748","10","Paine's wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at Scalise's place, adds that her father had gone to Paine's apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that she'd returned home with facial bruising."
"2675","tt0043132","6748","11","Paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father, Jiggs Taylor Tom Tully, had threatened that if it happened again he would beat Paine up."
"2676","tt0043132","6748","12","This information leads to Taylor being arrested and charged with murder."
"2677","tt0043132","6748","13","Nobody accepts Dixon's explanation that Scalise had killed the Texan and then had Paine killed to eliminate him as a witness."
"2678","tt0043132","6748","14","Dixon continues to make various attempts to get Scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in Paine's death and the cover up."
"2679","tt0043132","6748","15","He does this and also records that he is going alone to confront Scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for Dixon's murder."
"2680","tt0043132","6748","16","The confrontation with Scalise and the eventual means by which Dixon achieves his own redemption, provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller."
"2681","tt0043132","6748","17","Dana Andrews' strained and preoccupied expressions convey his character's perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow Paine's accidental death."
"2682","tt0043132","6748","18","Dixon, however, isn't the only one to experience misfortune as Morgan, a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her."
"2683","tt0043132","6748","19","Her father, who'd some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police, unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit."
"2684","tt0043132","6748","20","Ken Paine who'd been a war hero had experienced unemployment and a loss of self esteem which led to alcoholism and wife beating and Scalise who'd been set up in business by Dixon's father also suffers his own misfortunes."""
"2685","tt0043132","6748","21","Where The Sidewalk Ends"" is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity."
"2686","tt0043132","6749","1","The charm of Otto Preminger's grandiose, visionary film noir is that it has ambiguous intentions, betraying the gloomy essence of the central character, who is still vexed by living in the shadow of his criminal father."
"2687","tt0043132","6749","2","Dana Andrews' driven, vindictive cop is shown as an outsider, irrational and destructive, who maybe can change because he might've found a good woman to look after him."
"2688","tt0043132","6749","3","The troubled man reclaims himself with his own tangled impression of rectitude."
"2689","tt0043132","6749","4","The distressing mood permanently circuited into the latter half of the story by screenwriter Ben Hecht reverberates in Andrews' tense performance as Preminger saturates the film in a relevantly prosaic substance of style."
"2690","tt0043132","6749","5","We don't just see and hear the city at night; we feel it because Preminger lets us see and hear even the most peripheral and distant factors of it."
"2691","tt0043132","6749","6","Dana Andrews furnishes a complex character unfolded through his streaks of violence and the hatred that always infests him."
"2692","tt0043132","6749","7","As the plot develops, he is secretly entangled in situational snares, yet he is renewed by the outward acts that can be seen in the vintage noir protagonist's visceral facial expressions before he executes them."
"2693","tt0043132","6749","8","This reflection of a specific phase in the development of the genre is an engrossing, feral and shady film noir that is set in the double dealing climate of the underworld, where the hero is so estranged that he is always swelling with rage, and even though he loses his rational resistance, occupational principle, and ethical limits, he's still a good cop."
"2694","tt0043132","6749","9","Preminger just winks at telling a social conscience drama about a corrupted community within the sprawling cityscape, rather keeping the thriller riding on Andrews' shoulders as an existential journey of personal ramifications about a man with an Oedipal fixation who is becoming disconnected though with the ever shrinking influences of the law on his side and an undying perception of right and wrong."
"2695","tt0043132","6749","10","The production companies in the early 1950s pussed out on the social problem picture, and rather made ""low budget, low risk thrillers"" such as this, apparently in an attempt to evade the conniptions of conservative critics and social busybodies."
"2696","tt0043132","6749","11","But there is an expressionistic matter of factness to Preminger's inimitable approach."
"2697","tt0043132","6749","12","He injects each scene with a sense of everyday drama as a backdrop for the plot."
"2698","tt0043132","6749","13","Each supporting character must pull their own weight by doing something interesting, but none of them are cartoons or depressing comic reliefs."
"2699","tt0043132","6749","14","To him, every character thinks they're the star, as per the straight from the shoulder self assertion of Karl Malden as a missionary police inspector and a veteran waitress at a lunch counter."
"2700","tt0043132","6749","15","It is those who are the stars Andrews and Gene Tierney, both anguished by their futile attempts to subdue their emotional intensity who don't want to be."
"2701","tt0043132","6750","1","This is a very well made film, meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife."
"2702","tt0043132","6750","2","The plot is convincingly worked out and exciting."
"2703","tt0043132","6750","3","The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero."
"2704","tt0043132","6750","4","It's made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld characters."
"2705","tt0043132","6750","5","A couple of slight reservations: I found the ending slightly one sided as it celebrates the hero's successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system, which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters which has been maintained up to that point."
"2706","tt0043132","6750","6","Also I found the lead female character somewhat weak: little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero, all she seems to do is weep and swoon as the tough guys battle it out."
"2707","tt0043132","6751","1","Pretty good film from Preminger; labyrinthine at times, as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live."
"2708","tt0043132","6751","2","In this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying, as its hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head."
"2709","tt0043132","6751","3","Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet, and has never been better."
"2710","tt0043132","6751","4","The story may be pure melodrama but Andrews gives it weight, and almost raises it to the level of tragedy."
"2711","tt0043132","6751","5","As his girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but unremarkable."
"2712","tt0043132","6751","6","Gary Merrill makes for a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to Andrews' coolness; his smiling, amiable seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open, as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him."
"2713","tt0043132","6751","7","There are no major surprises in this film, which seems transitional for all concerned."
"2714","tt0043132","6751","8","For director Preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his Laura stars, Andrews and Tierney, who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made."
"2715","tt0043132","6751","9","The supporting cast, Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand are, understandably, more optimistic, as they were all on their way up."
"2716","tt0043132","6751","10","Preminger, as serene an observer as ever, lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view, as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain, much less resolve."
"2717","tt0043132","6752","1","A detective Dana Andrews with a reputation for violence accidentally kills a suspect in a murder Craig Stevens and then tries to cover it up."
"2718","tt0043132","6752","2","The Otto Preminger directed film has plenty of atmosphere but the story gets watered down when the dead man's wife Gene Tierney falls for Andrews."
"2719","tt0043132","6752","3","He was doing fairly well digging himself into and out of a big hole, but she was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for a noir film."
"2720","tt0043132","6752","4","Gary Merrill is great as Scalese, a crime boss that Andrews is obsessed with bringing down, and the tension between them gives the film its energy and drive, especially a scene in a bath house with Merrill, Andrews, and Neville Brand, and the night time rendezvous outside of Bellevue Hospital, that sets up what ought to have been the film's conclusion."
"2721","tt0043132","6752","5","High marks for atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc... and the general portrayal of the underworld, though the love angle and the simplistic good cop bad cop elements don't help its cause."
"2722","tt0043132","6753","1","Otto Preminger's noir classic works almost as a flip side of LAURA...while that film was glitzy and features the high fa luting Clifton Webb, this film is a whole lot seamier."
"2723","tt0043132","6753","2","Dana Andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves."
"2724","tt0043132","6753","3","Preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked."
"2725","tt0043132","6753","4","Andrews is quite fine a lot less wooden than he's been in the past and the stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney is stunningly beautiful!"
"2726","tt0043132","6753","5","Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim."
"2727","tt0043132","6753","6","WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must see and a terrific companion piece to Preminger's equally lurid WHIRLPOOL also starring Tierney."
"2728","tt0043132","6754","1","Director Otto Preminger reunites with his Laura stars Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this rough and ready to rumble film noir: Where The Sidewalk Ends."
"2729","tt0043132","6754","2","This film is complete with a well written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected turns, and clever dialogue and an eye pleasing look with great camera movements and dark and gritty film noir lighting."
"2730","tt0043132","6754","3","Dana Andrews stars as Detective Mark Dixon, part mobster and part cop, who has a reputation of being too physically tough with criminals."
"2731","tt0043132","6754","4","After one case sees Dixon in search of suspects and answers, he gets far more involved than he wanted."
"2732","tt0043132","6754","5","Dana Andrews is terrific in his role tough and edgy, Andrews' Dixon is ready to knock any and all off their heels if they get on his bad side."
"2733","tt0043132","6754","6","He's the perfect film noir anti hero he's not very nice all the time, but we still root for him."
"2734","tt0043132","6754","7","Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role, as much as it is, being a sweet shoulder for Dixon."
"2735","tt0043132","6754","8","There might not be too much to Tierney's role, but she certainly goes above and beyond what others could do with the role, knocking every member of the audience out with her kind smile, gentle manner, and twinkle in her eye."
"2736","tt0043132","6754","9","The supporting cast isn't too bad either Karl Malden being the most memorable, stepping in and giving a good supporting performance as Lieutenant Thomas."
"2737","tt0043132","6754","10","Where The Sidewalk Ends is no Laura, but it is a great film noir filled with great characters, story, and picture."
"2738","tt0043132","6755","1","Ah, noir."
"2739","tt0043132","6755","2","My favourite genre."
"2740","tt0043132","6755","3","Otto Preminger's follow up to ""Laura"" is a film noir set in a postwar New York, where corruption and violence run rampant."
"2741","tt0043132","6755","4","It stars Dana Andrews as Sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics have landed him in hot water with his superiors."
"2742","tt0043132","6755","5","When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to pin the blame on crime boss Tommy Scalese."
"2743","tt0043132","6755","6","Dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes involved with the dead man's wife, the beautiful Morgan Taylor."
"2744","tt0043132","6755","7","Of course, in typical noir fashion, things quickly go down hill."
"2745","tt0043132","6755","8","While the film does nothing interesting camera or narrative wise, it does have a constant tone of dread and gloom."
"2746","tt0043132","6755","9","Like most great noirs, it is also wonderfully paced, sucking the viewer in right from the start."
"2747","tt0043132","6755","10","Still, like most of Preminger's workmanlike films, it's not something I'd watch again."
"2748","tt0043132","6755","11","It lacks the verbal wit of Wilder, the visual flamboyance of Hitchcock or the spatial experimentation of Welles."
"2749","tt0043132","6755","12","Like Lang's later work, ""Sidewalk"" feels very much a ""clone"" of what a noir should be, instead of something really artistically genuine."
"2750","tt0043132","6755","13","Thematically the film is nothing special."
"2751","tt0043132","6755","14","It's about a cop who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal."
"2752","tt0043132","6755","15","In one scene Dixon explains that his father himself was a small time crook, the film flirting with the notion of predestination, but this one scene is as far as Otto goes, or dares to take his ideas."
"2753","tt0043132","6755","16","The camera work is likewise disappointing."
"2754","tt0043132","6755","17","There's no intelligence in Otto's camera."
"2755","tt0043132","6755","18","No effort is made to assign the camera to anything."
"2756","tt0043132","6755","19","It doesn't play with space or architecture or empahsise the step by step police procedural."
"2757","tt0043132","6755","20","It's just tripod set ups with the occasional dolly in and out."
"2758","tt0043132","6755","21","Meaningless, though most people don't care about these things."
"2759","tt0043132","6755","22","There is, however, one good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters noir cage which itself enters a vehicle lift another cage and is taken up into the chief gangster's lair."
"2760","tt0043132","6755","23","Like Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"", Otto retopologizes the film, constantly likens ""upstairs"" to hell."
"2761","tt0043132","6755","24","This works well, but the set design fails to reinforce it."
"2762","tt0043132","6755","25","7/10 Otto seems content to follow the Hawksian mould of what a noir is, rather than toy with the possibilities of where noir can go."
"2763","tt0043132","6755","26","Like ""Detour"", ""Night in the City"", ""Scarlet Street"", ""In A Lonely Place"", ""Act of Violence"", ""Bomberang"" and ""Johnny Eager"", ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" is one of those well made second tier film noirs."
"2764","tt0043132","6755","27","It's competent and engaging, but lacks that extra special magic."
"2765","tt0043132","6756","1","Otto Preminger, completing a noir cycle at Twentieth Century Fox, reunited his ""Laura"" leads for this stark, gritty detective drama."
"2766","tt0043132","6756","2","Dana Andrews again portrays a cop, but this time he's hardened, cynical and has been accused of police brutality by his superior ""You don't hate hoods, you liked to beat them up!""."
"2767","tt0043132","6756","3","Mark Dixon Andrews despises criminals, as his own father was a crook."
"2768","tt0043132","6756","4","He doesn't want to be ""Sandy Dixon's kid"" so he became a policeman, but his methods are harsh and hated."
"2769","tt0043132","6756","5","One night, investigating a murder, he unknowingly punches a suspect, Ken Paine Craig Stevens so hard that it kills him."
"2770","tt0043132","6756","6","A shaken Dixon does his best to cover it up, intending to frame a hated thug, Scalise Gary Merrill for the crime."
"2771","tt0043132","6756","7","However, the blame falls on Paine's father in law, Jiggs Taylor Tom Tully, whose daughter, department store model Morgan Taylor Tierney is estranged from her husband but keeps getting drawn into his gambling schemes."
"2772","tt0043132","6756","8","Paine had slapped his wife, enraging her father, who did show up at his son in law's apartment, but not until Dixon had departed with the body."
"2773","tt0043132","6756","9","With no better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged."
"2774","tt0043132","6756","10","Riddled with guilt, Mark falls for Morgan and offers money for an attorney."
"2775","tt0043132","6756","11","He decides to take on Scalise anyway but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death, confessing everything."
"2776","tt0043132","6756","12","In the end, he cannot live with the knowledge with what he has done, and he permits the letter to be read by his superior and by Morgan."
"2777","tt0043132","6756","13","Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan professes her love for Mark and will wait for him."
"2778","tt0043132","6756","14","It was great to find this film on DVD, after so many years of televised obscurity."
"2779","tt0043132","6756","15","Eddie Mueller, a film noir historian, provides the commentary and does a good job, but I find his assertion that audiences wouldn't have caught the significance of the casting of the two leads, since ""Laura"" had been made six years earlier."
"2780","tt0043132","6756","16","In that respect, he is mistaken because they had appeared in ""The Iron Curtain"" two years prior to WTSE and the film was a box office success."
"2781","tt0043132","6756","17","Andrews and Tierney were fabulous together, and Ruth Donnelly is tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner Martha, fanning the flames between the detective and the dame."
"2782","tt0043132","6756","18","The night cityscapes give the film an air of menace."
"2783","tt0043132","6756","19","Gary Merrill is great as the low life Scalise, who had a criminal past with Dixon's dad ""Your father liked me,"" he taunts Mark."
"2784","tt0043132","6756","20","Karl Malden and a young Neville Brand are terrific also."
"2785","tt0043132","6756","21","And Tom Tully is just touching and funny as Morgan's unjustly accused pop."
"2786","tt0043132","6756","22","A watchable film noir with a fantastic cast."
"2787","tt0043132","6757","1","Dana Andrews stands ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" in this 1950 film that also stars Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand."
"2788","tt0043132","6757","2","Andrews plays New York City Detective Sgt."
"2789","tt0043132","6757","3","Mark Dixon, a cop with a bad temper who has gotten into trouble in the past for beating suspects."
"2790","tt0043132","6757","4","When a man is murdered at a gambling club owned by a mobster, Scalise Merrill, Dixon and his partner go to investigate."
"2791","tt0043132","6757","5","Scalise blames the murder on Ken Paine Stevens, who has now left the club after fighting not only with his wife, Morgan Tierney but the victim."
"2792","tt0043132","6757","6","Dixon thinks the victim won a lot of money and was killed as a result by the mobster's men."
"2793","tt0043132","6757","7","He goes to see Paine and, not realizing he has a plate in his head from the war, knocks him to the floor and inadvertently kills him."
"2794","tt0043132","6757","8","Now he must cover up the murder."
"2795","tt0043132","6757","9","As a further complication, he falls for Morgan; her father Ken Tully, who went to Paine's apartment after he saw that Paine had hit his daughter, is arrested for the crime."
"2796","tt0043132","6757","10","This is a really terrific, gritty noir with some good performances."
"2797","tt0043132","6757","11","The ruggedly handsome and weathered Andrews is convincing as a tough yet nervous detective who has to stay one step ahead of his colleagues."
"2798","tt0043132","6757","12","The movie reunites him with his fabulous ""Laura"" costar, Gene Tierney, and she looks lovely as a model with bad taste in men who apparently is used to being roughed up."
"2799","tt0043132","6757","13","Little does she know, she's got another one on her hands."
"2800","tt0043132","6757","14","Ken Tully does a terrific job as her father, who protests his innocence despite some damning evidence."
"2801","tt0043132","6757","15","Karl Malden is very tough as Dixon's boss."
"2802","tt0043132","6757","16","My only problem with this well directed, fast moving and absorbing film is the ending."
"2803","tt0043132","6757","17","Pure Hollywood and, putting myself in Tierney's place, I doubt I would react the same way."
"2804","tt0043132","6757","18","A minor criticism for a film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger."
"2805","tt0043132","6757","19","I didn't find it as awe inspiring as ""Laura,"" but few things in this world are."
"2806","tt0043132","6757","20","If you like film noir, this is a must see."
"2807","tt0043132","6758","1","Where the Sidewalk Ends 1950Where One Ends, Another BeginsThis is a prototypical film noir, and as such, pretty flawless, from both style and content points of view."
"2808","tt0043132","6758","2","The photography and night settings are first rate cinematographer Joseph LaShelle lets the drama ooze in scene after scene, and the close ups on faces pure expressionism."
"2809","tt0043132","6758","3","I can watch this kind of film for the visuals alone, even when the actors struggle and the plot stinks."
"2810","tt0043132","6758","4","But the acting is first rate here, and the plot features what I consider the core of most noir films, the alienated male lead representing the many men returning home to a changed United States after the war and feeling lost themselves."
"2811","tt0043132","6758","5","In fact, not only is Dana Andrews really convincing as the troubled, loner detective, he has a small but important counterpart in the film, the lead female's first husband, an decorated ex GI fallen onto hard times and booze."
"2812","tt0043132","6758","6","The fact the one man kills the other might be of monumental significance, overall the regular guy struggling through his inner problems to success while the medal wearing soldier slips into an accidental death with a silver plate in his head."
"2813","tt0043132","6758","7","The woman transitions from one to the other we assume they marry and have children as suggested earlier in the movie."
"2814","tt0043132","6758","8","Even if this is pushing an interpretation onto it after the fact, we can still see the path of one man with some psychological baggage careening through a crisis to the highest kind of moral order turning himself in for a small crime just at the point he has actually gotten away with it."
"2815","tt0043132","6758","9","This movie belongs to Andrews."
"2816","tt0043132","6758","10","He plays a far more restrained and moving type than Kirk Douglas plays in a similar role in William Wyler's Detective Story made just one year later, and Andrews certainly is less theatrical."
"2817","tt0043132","6758","11","You could easily see both movies side by side for a textbook compare and contrast session."
"2818","tt0043132","6758","12","The fact that Andrews as Detective Dixon is morally struggling through it all, and Douglas as Detective McLeod is not, might explain why one man gets his girl and the other doesn't."
"2819","tt0043132","6758","13","Gene Tierney pulls off a hugely sympathetic, demurring, and ultimately conventional and ""pretty"" type of woman not just a cardboard desirable, but someone you want Dixon to actually marry."
"2820","tt0043132","6758","14","The criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama, but is effective enough in its play with types and clichés."
"2821","tt0043132","6758","15","The bit parts are kept snappy, the small details like the portable craps table nice touches, far from the character actors or the glamour of gambling in Casablanca."
"2822","tt0043132","6758","16","But then, Curtiz's great movie is iconic even in the details it makes no effort to be subtle and real and penetrating, but instead is sweeping and memorable and inspiring."
"2823","tt0043132","6758","17","They come at opposite ends of the war, and represent opposite possibilities for their leading men."
"2824","tt0043132","6758","18","Bogart is beginning his active duty, Dixon, and the man Dixon has killed, are all through."
"2825","tt0043132","6758","19","Through, thoroughly, but not washed up."
"2826","tt0043132","6758","20","It's no accident that many, possibly most, film noirs have what you would call ""happy"" endings."
"2827","tt0043132","6758","21","The man overcomes his adversaries and transforms his inner self, and the moviegoer, then and now, understands just how beautiful that must feel."
"2828","tt0043132","6759","1","WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS deserves to be a better known film directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world LAURA."
"2829","tt0043132","6759","2","And this time, he's got the same co stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY."
"2830","tt0043132","6759","3","It must be said that Tierney here is under used in what amounts to more of a supporting role while the spotlight goes to Andrews."
"2831","tt0043132","6759","4","He plays a tough, hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thugs in too vigorous a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him."
"2832","tt0043132","6759","5","When suspicion falls on a cab driver TOM TULLY, he goes along with the investigation into the murder but starts to feel guilt because he's in love with the cabbie's daughter GENE TIERNEY."
"2833","tt0043132","6759","6","Tierney, by the way, looks a little too elegant for the girl she's playing here and doesn't seem to fit into the squalid background elements of the story."
"2834","tt0043132","6759","7","The story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper and it's discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero."
"2835","tt0043132","6759","8","By the end, it turns into a morality tale with Andrews developing a conscience over his crime."
"2836","tt0043132","6759","9","It's fascinating as film noir with capable performances from a strong supporting cast."
"2837","tt0043132","6759","10","A good entry in the field of noir, forcefully directed by Preminger and nicely played by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slight miscasting of her character."
"2838","tt0043132","6760","1","I'm a big fan of fan of film noir, and this film by Otto Preminger easily stands as one of the best that I've seen!"
"2839","tt0043132","6760","2","Preminger has reunited two of his stars from the hit 'Laura' Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, for an entirely different sort of crime film."
"2840","tt0043132","6760","3","Laura was based around love, and this film is based around hate; as we watch police detective Mark Dixon, a copper already suffering scrutiny from his superiors for his heavy handed tactics, accidentally kill a suspect and try to pin the murder on a known criminal; a man by the name of Tommy Scalisi."
"2841","tt0043132","6760","4","The plot is brilliantly worked, and Preminger excellently balances several plot points; but it all comes back down to the main moral implication surrounding our main character."
"2842","tt0043132","6760","5","The fact that the film is set in the criminal underground means that the plot is given an excellent base to work from, and director Otto Preminger expertly captures the sleazier side of life by showing the main characters gambling, beating one another and their women, shooting and more and this also helps to offset the film from the earlier 'Laura', which was very much set in upper class society."
"2843","tt0043132","6760","6","The role of Mark Dixon gives Dana Andrews one of the most interesting parts of his career."
"2844","tt0043132","6760","7","Here, we have a character that is difficult to like as he's so cold but the fact that we can understand his motives ensures that he's easy to sympathise with, and that allows the audience the ability to plug into his plight."
"2845","tt0043132","6760","8","The character development is well timed, and as we've follows this character and his motivations throughout the film; everything makes sense by the end."
"2846","tt0043132","6760","9","His co star is the beautiful Gene Tierney, who isn't given as much to do in this film as she was in Laura; a film that made Tierney its linchpin."
"2847","tt0043132","6760","10","She does well with what she's got, however, and the lead duo's chemistry is excellent and Tierney helps to complete every scene she's in."
"2848","tt0043132","6760","11","I can't say that this is a better film than the earlier Laura; that's a hard act to follow, but this film certainly fits into the film noir formula better than Preminger's earlier film."
"2849","tt0043132","6760","12","The film also makes a good comparison piece for Laura; as just about everything in this film is opposite to the 1944 movie, yet it's all strangely familiar."
"2850","tt0043132","6760","13","Highly recommended to all!"
"2851","tt0043132","6761","1","Otto Preminger's Dana Andrews cycle of films noirs are among the largely unsung jewels of the genre."
"2852","tt0043132","6761","2","Because they lack paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, they may have seemed out of place at the time, but the clear eyed imagery, the complex play with identity, masculinity and representation, the subversion of traditional psychological tenets, the austere, geometrical style all seem startlingly modern today, and very similar to Melville."
"2853","tt0043132","6761","3","The lucid ironies of this film are so loaded, brutal and ironic that the 'happy' ending is one of the cruellest in Hollywood history."
"2854","tt0043132","6761","4","Brilliant on the level of entertaining thriller as well, tense, and packed with double edged dialogue."
"2855","tt0043132","6762","1","At first glance, it would seem natural to compare Where the Sidewalk Ends with Laura."
"2856","tt0043132","6762","2","Both have noirish qualities, both were directed by Otto Preminger, and both star Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney."
"2857","tt0043132","6762","3","But that's where most of the comparisons end."
"2858","tt0043132","6762","4","Laura dealt with posh, sophisticated people with means who just happen to find themselves mixed up in a murder."
"2859","tt0043132","6762","5","Where the Sidewalk Ends is set in a completely different strata."
"2860","tt0043132","6762","6","These are people with barely two nickels to rub together who are more accustomed to seeing the underbelly of society than going to fancy dress parties."
"2861","tt0043132","6762","7","Where the Sidewalk ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems with their fists or some other weapon."
"2862","tt0043132","6762","8","Small time hoods are a dime a dozen and cops routinely beat confessions out of the crooks."
"2863","tt0043132","6762","9","Getting caught up in a murder investigation seems as natural as breathing."
"2864","tt0043132","6762","10","While I haven't seen his entire body of work, based on what I have seen, Dana Andrews gives one of his best performances as the beat down cop, Det."
"2865","tt0043132","6762","11","Sgt."
"2866","tt0043132","6762","12","Mark Dixon."
"2867","tt0043132","6762","13","He's the kind of cop who is used to roughing up the local hoods if it gets him information or a confession."
"2868","tt0043132","6762","14","One night, he goes too far and accidentally kills a man."
"2869","tt0043132","6762","15","He does his best to cover it up."
"2870","tt0043132","6762","16","But things get complicated when he falls for the dead man's wife, Morgan Taylor Tierney, whose father becomes suspect number one in the murder case."
"2871","tt0043132","6762","17","As Morgan's father means the world to her, Dixon's got to do what he can to clear the old man without implicating himself."
"2872","tt0043132","6762","18","Technically, Where the Sidewalk Ends is outstanding."
"2873","tt0043132","6762","19","Besides the terrific performance from Andrews, the movie features the always delightful Tierney."
"2874","tt0043132","6762","20","She has a quality that can make even the bleakest of moments seem brighter."
"2875","tt0043132","6762","21","The rest of the cast is just as solid with Tom Tully as the wrongly accused father being a real standout."
"2876","tt0043132","6762","22","Beyond the acting, the direction, sets, lighting, and cinematography are all top notch."
"2877","tt0043132","6762","23","Overall, it's an amazingly well made film."
"2878","tt0043132","6762","24","If I have one complaint and admittedly it's a very, very minor quibble it's that Tierney is almost too perfect for the role and her surroundings."
"2879","tt0043132","6762","25","It's a little difficult to believe that a woman like that could find herself mixed up with some of these unsavory characters."
"2880","tt0043132","6762","26","It's not really her fault, it's just the way Tierney comes across."
"2881","tt0043132","6762","27","She seems a little too beautiful, polished, and delicate for the part."
"2882","tt0043132","6762","28","But, her gentle, kind, trusting nature add a sense of needed realism to her portrayal."
"2883","tt0043132","6763","1","Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when folks at least folks who might do such a thing sit around and talk about film noir."
"2884","tt0043132","6763","2","Yet some of the best films of the genre, ""Out of the Past,"" ""The Killers,"" ""In A Lonely Place,"" ""Night and the City,"" manage a level of sleek sophistication that elevates them beyond a moody catch phrase and its connotations of foreboding shadows, fedoras, and femme fatales."
"2885","tt0043132","6763","3","""Where the Sidewalk Ends,"" a fairly difficult to find film the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in Manhattan was a rough bootleg from the AMC cable channel belongs in a category with these classics."
"2886","tt0043132","6763","4","From the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass, a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective Marc Dixon's crumbling world, and as the moments pass, it inches ever closer, threatening suffocation."
"2887","tt0043132","6763","5","Sure, he's that familiar ""cop with a dark past"", but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a bleak stare and troubled intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he seems."
"2888","tt0043132","6763","6","And yeah, he's been smacking around suspects for too long, and the newly promoted chief Karl Malden, in a typically robust and commanding outing is warning him ""for the last time."""
"2889","tt0043132","6763","7","Yet Dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now."
"2890","tt0043132","6763","8","And boy didn't they had have it coming."
"2891","tt0043132","6763","9","""Hoods, dusters, mugs, gutter nickel rats"" he spits when that tough nut of a boss demotes him and rolls out all of the complaints the bureau has been receiving about Dixon's right hook."
"2892","tt0043132","6763","10","The advice is for him to cool off for his own good."
"2893","tt0043132","6763","11","But instead he takes matters into his own hands."
"2894","tt0043132","6763","12","And what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts, and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before."
"2895","tt0043132","6763","13","Right away he's in deep with the cops, the syndicate, his own partner."
"2896","tt0043132","6763","14","Dixon's questionable involvement in a murder ""investigation"" threatens his job, makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has sworn to bring in."
"2897","tt0043132","6763","15","Like Bogart in ""Lonely Place,"" can he ""escape what he is."""
"2898","tt0043132","6763","16","When he has nowhere else to turn, he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty the marvelous Gene Tierney who seems as if she can turn his barren bachelor's existence into something worth coming home to."
"2899","tt0043132","6763","17","The pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping."
"2900","tt0043132","6763","18","The group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder, passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy."
"2901","tt0043132","6763","19","And all of this top notch direction and acting isn't too slick or buffed to loosen the film's emotional hold."
"2902","tt0043132","6763","20","Gene Tierney's angelic, soft focus beauty is used to great effect."
"2903","tt0043132","6763","21","She shows herself to be an actress of considerable range, and her gentle, kind nature is as boundless here as is her psychosis in ""Leave Her to Heaven."""
"2904","tt0043132","6763","22","The scenes between Tierney and Andrews's Dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to self destruction."
"2905","tt0043132","6763","23","Near the end of his rope, cut, bruised, and exhausted Dixon summarizes his lot: ""Innocent people can get into terrible jams, too,.."" he says."
"2906","tt0043132","6763","24","""One false move and you're in over your head."""
"2907","tt0043132","6763","25","Perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right with one slight shift in the wind, one wrong decision or punch, or, most frighteningly, due to factors you have no control over."
"2908","tt0043132","6763","26","Noir has always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface."
"2909","tt0043132","6763","27","""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" does so in a realistic fashion."
"2910","tt0043132","6763","28","One nit pick of an aside: This otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldn't seem out of place on Mystery Science Theater."
"2911","tt0043132","6763","29","How very odd."
"2912","tt0043132","6763","30","But Noir fans heck, ANY movie fans who haven't seen this one are in for a terrific treat."
"2913","tt0043132","6764","1","In Where The Sidewalk Ends, Otto Preminger reunites Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney, surely in hopes of recapturing the magic of his Laura."
"2914","tt0043132","6764","2","But they're wildly dissimilar films, set in different strata of New York not to mention at opposite poles of the noir universe."
"2915","tt0043132","6764","3","A fine mist of the Gothic hovers over the upscale Manhattan of Laura, with its erotic obsession and faint whiff of necrophilia; Where The Sidewalk Ends is pure urban soot and grit befouling a town of basement apartments, steam rooms and parking garages."
"2916","tt0043132","6764","4","But it's every bit as fine a movie as its revered forerunner, and dyed in the wool noir Laura, by contrast, one of the clutch of films from 1944 which the French first dubbed `noir,' was still very much a sophisticated murder mystery."
"2917","tt0043132","6764","5","Daylight enters only on very temporary sufferance, and director of photography Joseph LaShelle makes the most of the alleys and brownstones, the docks and the El."
"2918","tt0043132","6764","6","This is quintessential big city specifically Big Apple noir, like several others from the bumper crop of 1950, like Side Street and Sleeping City and The Tattooed Stranger and Edge of Doom."
"2919","tt0043132","6764","7","As the movie opens, police detective Dana Andrews is on the carpet for his brutal ways, particularly his vendetta towards crime boss Gary Merrill whom we learn was set up in business by Andrews' ne'er do well father."
"2920","tt0043132","6764","8","When an out of towner is stabbed to death at a floating crap game operated by Merrill, the hair trigger Andrews roughs up a witness, causing him a fatal crack to the skull exacerbated by a steel plate installed in the veteran's head."
"2921","tt0043132","6764","9","Realizing that his job's already on the line, Andrews dumps the body in the river after making it look like the suspect had taken a powder."
"2922","tt0043132","6764","10","Of course, that's far from an end to it."
"2923","tt0043132","6764","11","The corpse is discovered, his estranged wife turns out to be Tierney, and all the evidence starts to turn toward her father Tom Tully, a hack driver who happened not only to have been cruising the same mean streets the night of the murder but to have ample reason to want his abusive son in law dead."
"2924","tt0043132","6764","12","But the embittered loner Andrews finds in Tierney a summons to his better nature; he tries to exonerate her father while still keeping his own involvement in the whole sordid business a secret...."
"2925","tt0043132","6764","13","Not so epigrammatic as Laura, the script for Where The Sidewalk Ends by Ben Hecht shows a pungency of its own in a second dressing down, his superior tells Andrews, `Look at you all bunged up like a barrelhouse fag'."
"2926","tt0043132","6764","14","But while Laura spread its attention over half a dozen characters, here Andrews is all but the sole focus even Tierney's role is far less central than her half spectral Laura."
"2927","tt0043132","6764","15","And Andrews may never have excelled his performance here."
"2928","tt0043132","6764","16","It's tight lipped and taciturn, but never more eloquent than when his face is silently registering the anguish to which his own obstinacy has brought him."
"2929","tt0043132","6764","17","He's a pent up sufferer who can find release only through the safety valve of violence he even lashes out against his loyal partner, Bert Freed."
"2930","tt0043132","6764","18","To be sure, he finds too swift a road to redemption though the agency of his beautiful co star."
"2931","tt0043132","6764","19","But that was the style of the times, and a sweetened up ending does little to undermine this New York story of violence, corruption and urban entanglements."
"2932","tt0043132","6765","1","We're a long way from LAURA."
"2933","tt0043132","6765","2","Once again Otto Preminger directs, Dana Andrews stars as a police detective named Mark, and Gene Tierney is the beautiful woman who haunts him, but nothing else about WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS resembles everyone's favorite sophisticated murder mystery."
"2934","tt0043132","6765","3","Instead of deliciously quotable dialogue we get gritty, harrowing realism."
"2935","tt0043132","6765","4","While the earlier film took place in the ritzy upper echelons of New York society, here we're in the low rent district of dark streets, hoodlums, cheap restaurants and crummy flats."
"2936","tt0043132","6765","5","Tierney, gorgeous as ever, now works as a department store mannequin and lives in Washington Heights the neighborhood of the ""doll"" who once got a fox fur out of LAURA's Mark McPherson."
"2937","tt0043132","6765","6","This time Andrews is Mark Dixon, an older, sadder, more troubled version of the cool cop in a trench coat."
"2938","tt0043132","6765","7","WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS belongs to a sub genre of noir, movies about police brutality focusing on cops who can't control their violent impulses."
"2939","tt0043132","6765","8","Like Kirk Douglas's character in DETECTIVE STORY, Dixon owes his seething contempt for crooks to his father's criminal past."
"2940","tt0043132","6765","9","Where Douglas is self righteous and blind to his own faults, Andrews is burdened by repressed guilt and self loathing."
"2941","tt0043132","6765","10","He accidentally kills a suspect and covers up his actions with an attempt to throw suspicion on a slimy gangster Gary Merrill whom he has been vainly pursuing for years."
"2942","tt0043132","6765","11","Instead, a kindly cab driver is suspected because he's the father of the dead man's estranged and mistreated wife Morgan Gene Tierney."
"2943","tt0043132","6765","12","Dixon, falling in love with the wife of the man he killed, tries desperately to save her father without giving himself away."
"2944","tt0043132","6765","13","Among noir protagonists, Dana Andrews had this distinction: he was incapable of appearing unintelligent."
"2945","tt0043132","6765","14","Even when playing an average Joe, as he usually did, he always comes across as unusually sensitive and perceptive; more than that, his air of being too thoughtful for his own comfort gives him that haunted and haunting quality that was his essence as an actor."
"2946","tt0043132","6765","15","He played ordinary guys, cops and soldiers, but always with a tragic undercurrent of seeing and knowing too much."
"2947","tt0043132","6765","16","His conscientious heroes are marked by exhaustion, guilt, the inability ever to ""lighten up."""
"2948","tt0043132","6765","17","No other actor could have expressed so well the bottled up anger, the slow burning pain, the agonized intelligence of Mark Dixon."
"2949","tt0043132","6765","18","He also has a muted tenderness, a muffled warmth and even wry humor that make him heartbreaking."
"2950","tt0043132","6765","19","This comes out when he takes Morgan to a restaurant where he's a regular, and for the first time we see this cold, brutal man trading mock insults with the waitress, whose sarcasm can't hide her affection and concern for him."
"2951","tt0043132","6765","20","When Dixon asks his partner for money to get a lawyer for Morgan's father, he supplies it even though they recently argued and Dixon threw a punch at him."
"2952","tt0043132","6765","21","There are no words about loyalty or knowing he's a good guy deep down, but we see it all in the man's anguished silence and his wife's resignation as she hands over some jewelry to pawn."
"2953","tt0043132","6765","22","Dixon's goodness comes across through other people's reactions to him as much as through Andrews's deeply moving performance."
"2954","tt0043132","6765","23","Though Dana Andrews was a minor star, he may be the quintessential forties man."
"2955","tt0043132","6765","24","He goes through some movies hardly ever taking off his overcoat; with that boxy, mid century silhouette, further fortified by the fedora, the glass of bourbon, the cigarette he doesn't take out of his mouth when he talks, he looks imprisoned in the masculine ideal of toughness and impassivity."
"2956","tt0043132","6765","25","While many noirs romanticize the two fisted tough guy, WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS offers an unflinching portrait of the reality behind the façade, a gripping and melancholy exploration of the roots and consequences of violence."
"2957","tt0043132","6765","26","Andrews was sadly underrated in his own time he was the only one of the three protagonists in THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES not nominated for an Academy Award, though his low key performance is far more compelling than Frederic March's hammy, Oscar winning drunk."
"2958","tt0043132","6765","27","Fortunately, Andrews appeared in some films that ensured his immortality, and now at last this little known film, which contains his best performance, can be seen as part of the marvelous Fox Film Noir set."
"2959","tt0043132","6765","28","This series, including a number of never before released titles such as NIGHTMARE ALLEY and THIEVES' HIGHWAY, suggests that Twentieth Century Fox may have had the finest record of all the major studios when it came to film noir."
"2960","tt0043132","6766","1","Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is Otto Preminger's 'Where the Sidewalks Ends,' from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel 'Night Cry' by Frank Rosenberg..."
"2961","tt0043132","6766","2","Dana Andrews is the honest, tough New York policeman, always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong arm methods as much as he detests crooks..."
"2962","tt0043132","6766","3","When he hit someone, his knuckles hurt..."
"2963","tt0043132","6766","4","And the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain Gary Merrill who points up the title."
"2964","tt0043132","6766","5","'Why are you always trying to push me in the gutter.' he asks Andrews."
"2965","tt0043132","6766","6","'I have as much right on the sidewalk as you.'"
"2966","tt0043132","6766","7","Dana Andrew's obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden, painful discovery that he is the son of a thief..."
"2967","tt0043132","6766","8","His deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta..."
"2968","tt0043132","6766","9","By a twist of irony unique to the film itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of 'Laura' are united once more, and Andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later, but no longer the romantic, beaten down by his job, by the cheap crooks..."
"2969","tt0043132","6766","10","This time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect..."
"2970","tt0043132","6766","11","The killing is accidental, the victim worthless, yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail..."
"2971","tt0043132","6766","12","Using his knowledge of police procedure, he covers up his part in the crime, plants false clues, and tries to implicate a gang leader, but cannot avoid investigating the case himself..."
"2972","tt0043132","6766","13","The double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder, is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical, satisfying, and in no way a compromise..."
"2973","tt0043132","6766","14","The film is one of the best detective films of the 50's, with curious moral values, also one of Preminger's best..."
"2974","tt0043132","6766","15","Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism..."
"2975","tt0043137","6916","1","Winchester '73 was the film that moved Mann from the b movies to the big league, rescuing James Stewart's floundering post war career in the process by casting him as a conflicted hero although since he inherited the project from Fritz Lang, maybe Lang deserves the credit for that."
"2976","tt0043137","6916","2","Both men would go to much darker places Mann with the remarkably bleak Devil's Doorway, which remained shelved by MGM until the success of Broken Arrow convinced them to release it  but a movie about a man hunting down his own brother as the rifle of the title is handed from person to person along the trail before it ends up in one of the director's beloved mountainside shootouts is still stronger meat than you'd expect from the studio system."
"2977","tt0043137","6916","3","Great dialogue, an impressive supporting cast  Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C."
"2978","tt0043137","6916","4","Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them  and Mann's outstanding visual sense raise the bar with this one."
"2979","tt0043137","6917","1","This is a story of the Winchester Rifle Model 1873 ""The Gun That Won The West"" To cowman, outlaw, peace officer or soldier, the Winchester 73 was a treasured possession."
"2980","tt0043137","6917","2","An Indian would sell his soul to own one..."
"2981","tt0043137","6917","3","Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo that would go on to create a run of superior Westerns that added a new, psychological depth to the genre."
"2982","tt0043137","6917","4","The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam pursuing the man who killed his father."
"2983","tt0043137","6917","5","Riding into Dodge City with his trusty friend, Johnny Williams Millard Mitchell, Lin runs into Dutch Henry Brown Stephen McNally, the man he wants."
"2984","tt0043137","6917","6","But with Wyatt Earp Will Geer having taken all the guns from those entering the town, both men are unable to have the shoot out that they are ready for."
"2985","tt0043137","6917","7","The men instead square up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that Lin eventually wins."
"2986","tt0043137","6917","8","But before he can leave town with the magnificent prize, Dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and skips town fast."
"2987","tt0043137","6917","9","As Lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle, the rifle will changed hands a number of times, with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches."
"2988","tt0043137","6917","10","Very much a benchmark for what became known as the so called ""psychological Western"", Winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past."
"2989","tt0043137","6917","11","Tho shot in black and white the only one of the duos Westerns that was the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes."
"2990","tt0043137","6917","12","The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City."
"2991","tt0043137","6917","13","It's just the starting point that would see Mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states."
"2992","tt0043137","6917","14","Stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as McAdam, proving once and for all that he was one of Americas finest and most versatile actors."
"2993","tt0043137","6917","15","The support cast isn't too bad either."
"2994","tt0043137","6917","16","Shelley Winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and the always great Dan Duryea add further class to proceedings."
"2995","tt0043137","6917","17","There's even bit parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson in here, tho the latter playing an Indian brave is a stretch too far."
"2996","tt0043137","6917","18","Originally the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who even had the script ready to run."
"2997","tt0043137","6917","19","But Lang walked away from it, something that proved to be a blessing for Western fans."
"2998","tt0043137","6917","20","For as great as a director that Lang was, with Mann directing and with a new script from Borden Chase & Robert Richards in hands it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre."
"2999","tt0043137","6917","21","Not only with the further efforts that Mann & Stewart produced, but also in who they influenced."
"3000","tt0043137","6917","22","The likes of Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller were all taking notes, and gleefully for the Western purists, they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further."

"3049","tt0043137","6923","1","CONTAINS SPOILER With the possible exception of John Wayne, no other actor sat taller in the saddle in Westerns than James Stewart, and this movie proves it."
"3050","tt0043137","6923","2","This superb tale of revenge centered around a Winchester rifle,has only one weak spot I can think of: the casting of Will Geer as a very unEarp like Wyatt Earp."
"3051","tt0043137","6923","3","The casting of the villains was good:Stephen McNally, as surly Dutch Henry,Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean, and John McIntireversatile at playing both good guys and bad guys as a slick gun runner."
"3052","tt0043137","6923","4","The showdown between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is great!"
"3053","tt0043137","6923","5","I'd stack this Western against the whole crop of Westerns made today."
"3054","tt0043137","6923","6","They wouldn't stand a chance!"
"3055","tt0043137","6924","1","This complicated western was a milestone in the career of JAMES STEWART after his return from war service, wanting to change his image by doing a western, which is largely regarded as the reason for the influx of westerns in the '50s since it's very impressive."
"3056","tt0043137","6924","2","Too bad it wasn't photographed in Technicolor."
"3057","tt0043137","6924","3","Stewart wins first prize for ""the gun that won the West"", but then has to spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when it's stolen."

"3060","tt0043137","6924","6","And wouldn't you know that, it being a Universal International film, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON both quite unknown at the time have bit roles."
"3061","tt0043137","6924","7","An interesting sequence features the first Indian attack, whereby CHARLES DRAKE reveals himself to be a coward who rides off, leaving Shelley alone in the horse drawn wagon."
"3062","tt0043137","6924","8","He later redeems himself, but it's just one of the twists and turns that has the gun passing from one unsavory hand to another but finally ending up with the rightful owner."
"3063","tt0043137","6924","9","STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have quite a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic but not quite as DUEL IN THE SUN's blazing guns finale."
"3064","tt0043137","6924","10","McNally makes the perfect villain and DAN DURYEA is equally treacherous in the kind of villainous role he played throughout the '40s as a low life gunslinger."
"3065","tt0043137","6924","11","Tightly constructed story is extremely well directed by Anthony Mann, and it's fun to see ROCK HUDSON credited as Young Bull wearing Indian war paint and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who casts longing glances at the then slim and attractive Shelley Winters."
"3066","tt0043137","6924","12","Well worth viewing and definitely an above average story."
"3067","tt0043137","6925","1","Lin McAdam James Stewart wins a rifle, a Winchester in a shooting contest."
"3068","tt0043137","6925","2","Dutch Henry Brown Stephen McNally is a bad loser and steals the gun."

"3070","tt0043137","6925","4","The rifle gets in different hands on the way."
"3071","tt0043137","6925","5","Will it get back to the right owner."
"3072","tt0043137","6925","6","Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece, Winchester '73 1950."
"3073","tt0043137","6925","7","Stewart is the right man to play the lead."
"3074","tt0043137","6925","8","He was always the right man to do anything."
"3075","tt0043137","6925","9","The terrific Shelley Winters plays the part of Lola Manners and she's great as always."
"3076","tt0043137","6925","10","Dan Duryea is terrific at the part of Waco Johnnie Dean."
"3077","tt0043137","6925","11","Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend Steve Miller."
"3078","tt0043137","6925","12","Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the movie, and they're played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell."
"3079","tt0043137","6925","13","The young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and the young Anthony Tony Curtis plays Doan."
"3080","tt0043137","6925","14","There are many classic moments in this movie."
"3081","tt0043137","6925","15","In one point the group is surrounded by Indians, since this is a western."
"3082","tt0043137","6925","16","It's great to watch this survival game where the fastest drawer and the sharpest shooter is the winner."
"3083","tt0043137","6925","17","All the true western fans will love this movie."
"3084","tt0043137","6926","1","The narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother."
"3085","tt0043137","6926","2","The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness."
"3086","tt0043137","6926","3","His brother, who operates under the persona of Dutch Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, stands for the classic stage coach robbing western outlaw, chased by his brother for having killed their father."
"3087","tt0043137","6926","4","The world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town, and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman Wyat Earp."
"3088","tt0043137","6926","5","Present as well are such flat characters typical of the western, such as the murderous Indian warrior, the besieged cavalryman, and the bonnet clad damsel in distress."
"3089","tt0043137","6926","6","Another important archetype in this film, that which gives the film it's name, is a custom made Winchester rifle."
"3090","tt0043137","6926","7","The weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably."
"3091","tt0043137","6926","8","Once it is stolen from its rightful owner, it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it."
"3092","tt0043137","6926","9","In this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the blood stained letter in Saving Private Ryan."
"3093","tt0043137","6926","10","This gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols."
"3094","tt0043137","6926","11","Being essentially a revenge film, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet, and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven."
"3095","tt0043137","6926","12","There is also a tacit theme of rape in Winchester '73."
"3096","tt0043137","6926","13","Waco Johnny Dean, one of the film's villains played very effectively by Dan Duryea, abducts a woman after killing her husband."
"3097","tt0043137","6926","14","The volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband, and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off."
"3098","tt0043137","6926","15","Waco Johnny Dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous Winchester rifle."
"3099","tt0043137","6926","16","The main story of Winchester '73 is reminiscent of the mythological tale of Jason and his quest for the golden fleece, as told in Apollonius' Argonautica."
"3100","tt0043137","6926","17","Both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some sort of intangible quality."
"3101","tt0043137","6926","18","Like Jason, Stewart's character hops from one adventure to the next in search of a one of a kind prize."
"3102","tt0043137","6926","19","Another theme in Winchester '73 that is similar to a mythic tale is the struggle between brothers."
"3103","tt0043137","6926","20","Several stories of antiquity deal with this issue, such as the Hebrew Bible's tale of Cain and Abel, and the vulgate tale of Romulus and Remus."
"3104","tt0043137","6926","21","As for the theme of abduction and rape present in Anthony Mann's film, it is present in many mythological works, such as the rape of Europa as told by Ovid in his Metamorphoses."
"3105","tt0043137","6926","22","Winchester '73 is a fine example of the western genre, and acts as the objective correlative for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes."
"3106","tt0043137","6927","1","One of the greatest westerns of all time!"
"3107","tt0043137","6927","2","But this one, unlike many others, does not deal with the nature, horses, shootouts, etc., but instead deals with one rifle, the Winchester '73, and how this one rifle effects others and how they effect it."
"3108","tt0043137","6927","3","A rifle is not a living, breathing, human being, right."
"3109","tt0043137","6927","4","You may be inclined to believe that it is not."
"3110","tt0043137","6927","5","But it seems to have a mind of its own, for two very similar reasons: it gets back to its rightful owner in the end, even though that throughout the rest of the picture, its unthoughtful ""owners"" do their best to make sure it does not, and it never seems to be content until it gets back to its original owner, so, coincidentally, the unthoughtful ""owners"" always seem to lose it somehow or get killed trying to protect and keep it, until it gets back to James Stewart, then it is ""content""."
"3111","tt0043137","6927","6","But, not every one of the owners deserves to have it."
"3112","tt0043137","6927","7","Stewart does, of course, since he won it."
"3113","tt0043137","6927","8","McNally does not, since he had to be a dirty thief and steal it."
"3114","tt0043137","6927","9","Drake definitely does not, because he would probably lose it in some poker game, and besides, Drake is too cowardly to fight, so why should he have a one of a kind rifle if he will not even use it."
"3115","tt0043137","6927","10","Duryea does not, because he is just a chuckling maniac, and we all know that chuckling maniacs do not deserve guns."
"3116","tt0043137","6927","11","This film has a sort of noir edge that only Westerns can have, such as the Ox Bow Incident."
"3117","tt0043137","6927","12","Westerns have their own type of noir, much different than the 30's and 40's Bogart films."
"3118","tt0043137","6927","13","It is, hands down, the best one out of all five Stewart Mann westerns, even though my personal favorite is ""Bend of the River""."
"3119","tt0043137","6927","14","The other four became much different than this one."
"3120","tt0043137","6927","15","I do not think it a coincidence to see that the other four were color, and this is black and white."
"3121","tt0043137","6927","16","This is because of the noir edge."
"3122","tt0043137","6927","17","All five films had the revenge and the dark past on Stewart's part play into the film, to the point where this is not just Stewart's dark side, but also actually a sort of character, not one to be listed in the credits, but one that you can only recognize and know that it is there, always present."
"3123","tt0043137","6927","18","However, this one, not just on revenge and the dark past, but also in terms of supreme danger, and characters that were very different than Stewart make it surpass the other four in all aspects."
"3124","tt0043137","6927","19","But Stewart never crosses the line."
"3125","tt0043137","6927","20","He does, however, walk the line between light and dark."
"3126","tt0043137","6927","21","This is why black and white played such an integral part in the film."
"3127","tt0043137","6927","22","They could have all been black and white, or they could have all been color."
"3128","tt0043137","6927","23","But this one is in black and white, and the other four are in color, and there is a very good reason for that."
"3129","tt0043137","6928","1","The larger than life figures of Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson, and the specters of George Armstrong Custer and Sitting Bull, loom over director Anthony Mann's hugely entertaining first western with James Stewart."
"3130","tt0043137","6928","2","Although Stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story, Winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece, with the eponymous, one in a thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners, including a wry trader John McIntire, especially great and outlaw Dan Duryea, who's even more despicable than usual."
"3131","tt0043137","6928","3","The film's conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with Mann's pared down, compositionally rigorous film making."
"3132","tt0043137","6928","4","His themes of psychological unrest and past dictating present faintly underlie this tall tale of good and bad men chasing after a fabled gun, but they starkly emerge in a vignette about a husband's cowardice and failed attempt at atonement, and are defined in Stewart's conversations with sidekick Millard Mitchell."
"3133","tt0043137","6928","5","Mann's use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns."
"3134","tt0043137","6928","6","Instead of gazing at vistas from afar, he incorporates them into the drama as characters that redirect, complicate, or evoke the human characters' goals."
"3135","tt0043137","6928","7","Just as mountains, caves, and rapids had to be accounted for in The Naked Spur, here a gunfight occurs amidst the loose rocks and boulders of a small mountain, a physical obstruction that fatalistically determines the roles of victor and victim between two equally skilled sharpshooters."
"3136","tt0043137","6928","8","I would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer William H."
"3137","tt0043137","6928","9","Daniels's contribution, particularly his superlative day for night, open range photography."
"3138","tt0043137","6928","10","Not merely an adept outdoorsman, Mann presents an equally vivid picture of Wyatt Earp patrolled Dodge City, primarily through scaled, multiple plane staging."
"3139","tt0043137","6928","11","The shooting contest does not depend on brisk camera shifts or twitchy cuts for effect because Mann instinctively knows where to place the camera and how to move it to display the greatest density of information in a given shot."
"3140","tt0043137","6928","12","Nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue, relying on the actors' eyes or a well chosen image to convey the stakes."
"3141","tt0043137","6928","13","One scene in particular serves to explain his attitude: Mitchell's telling of Stewart's motivation to Shelley Winters, which is interrupted by the climactic gunfight that soon enough reveals all."
"3142","tt0043137","6928","14","Light without feeling insubstantial, intense without being overbearing, Winchester '73 seems more modern than its contemporaries and is a joy to behold."
"3143","tt0043137","6929","1","Saw this flick on ENCW last nite for the third or fourth time."
"3144","tt0043137","6929","2","Enjoyed it so much I ordered the DVD."
"3145","tt0043137","6929","3","This really is a standout and of course the first of the Mann Stewart pairings."
"3146","tt0043137","6929","4","More here than the usual oater, although not quite as powerful as The Searchers."
"3147","tt0043137","6929","5","Lots of obvious symbolism about achieving manhood but mainly it's the acting by Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and the Waco Johnny Dean Dan Duryea."
"3148","tt0043137","6929","6","Steve Miller not The Joker is interesting as a handsome would be hero who's interested in Lola but too yellow ."
"3149","tt0043137","6929","7","Like Stewart in The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance, he's practically reduced to putting on an apron and serving his enemies coffee."
"3150","tt0043137","6929","8","Decaf no doubt."
"3151","tt0043137","6929","9","Tony Curtis from the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson behaving like no Indian I've seen on screen have interesting cameos."
"3152","tt0043137","6929","10","Special performances by John McIntire as a too lucky card dealing/gun trader who hangs out at a very low grade Western version of Rick's American Cafe."
"3153","tt0043137","6929","11","Nobody wants to spend the night there."
"3154","tt0043137","6929","12","Jay C."
"3155","tt0043137","6929","13","Flippens out over a kiss from Lola Winters and has some nice scenes with Stewart before he gets to Bend of the River and Far Country."
"3156","tt0043137","6929","14","Will Geer as Wyatt Earp and the Indian Chief who takes Walter Brennan's teeth from him in Red River are pleasant sightings."
"3157","tt0043137","6929","15","This is the kind of western that only Stewart, not Wayne nor Scott could have pulled off."
"3158","tt0043137","6929","16","Worth the shot, I repeat. :"
"3159","tt0043137","6930","1","This is quite an unusual and unique little western, that is made mostly original due to its story that revolves around an unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and all of those who get to poses it at one point or another in the movie."
"3160","tt0043137","6930","2","It's mostly a very entertaining movie to watch but not without still being a real western as well."
"3161","tt0043137","6930","3","The movie got done in a typical '40's/'50's style of western genre film making, so the lovers of the genre should not be turned off by its somewhat unusual main premise."
"3162","tt0043137","6930","4","Because the rifle is actually being the main plot device of the movie, it allows the story to follow multiple characters throughout the movie, who are all connected of course and the story makes full circle in the end."
"3163","tt0043137","6930","5","Without that this movie would had been a pretty messy one to watch, since the story often jumps from the one hazardous occasion into the other, with constantly different characters involved."
"3164","tt0043137","6930","6","Quite amazing how they even managed to put Wyatt Earp in this all."
"3165","tt0043137","6930","7","But it's no criticism really."
"3166","tt0043137","6930","8","I liked that the movie and its story were being original and how the movie seemed to move from the one event to the other."
"3167","tt0043137","6930","9","It gave the movie a bit of a sense of adventure and entertainment."
"3168","tt0043137","6930","10","It's also a really great looking movie."
"3169","tt0043137","6930","11","I liked the settings the movie used and it seems quite amazing that this was actually the director Anthony Mann's first western."
"3170","tt0043137","6930","12","Luckily he would go on to direct more westerns later on, which also often would star James Stewart in the main lead."
"3171","tt0043137","6930","13","It was a pretty daring casting choice to pick James Stewart as the main lead."
"3172","tt0043137","6930","14","He is one of the softest and most polite looking and acting actors, so casting him as a tough gunslinger seems like a bit of an odd pick."
"3173","tt0043137","6930","15","But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and it shows how versatile and really capable as an actor he actually was."
"3174","tt0043137","6930","16","It also has some other surprising actors in the movie, that are not often get connected with this genre."
"3175","tt0043137","6930","17","Shelley Winters plays the female lead and also later well known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in some small roles."

"3177","tt0043137","6931","1","By 1955, five years after this one was released James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed another six films together, four of them Westerns."
"3178","tt0043137","6931","2","Their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a Universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic."
"3179","tt0043137","6931","3","Buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known and that's not counting Ray Teal or 'Anthony' Curtis, later to become Tony."
"3180","tt0043137","6931","4","Perhaps ten years later the 'psychological' western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw Ahab into the mix with Cain and Abel, to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way, and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned."
"3181","tt0043137","6931","5","One to add to the DVD collection."
"3182","tt0043137","6932","1","WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man Jimmy Stewart obsessed with getting back his prized possession, a repeating rifle made by Winchester."

"3184","tt0043137","6932","3","This 1950 B&W effort by Anthony Mann is more a crime film than a traditional western, and the cowboys often seem more like modern day gangsters than old fashioned cowboys."
"3185","tt0043137","6932","4","Shelley Winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is headed for a ranch with a man Charles Drake she may marry."
"3186","tt0043137","6932","5","She ends up falling for Stewart, but not before she is passed around a bit."
"3187","tt0043137","6932","6","Winters is the most complex character in a film filled with unusual characters."
"3188","tt0043137","6932","7","Watch for a young Dan Dureyea as a nutty killer and Tony Curtis in a very small role."

"3190","tt0043137","6933","1","A new creative team emerged in 1950 when brilliant actor James Stewart teamed with the equally brilliant director Anthony Mann to make a series of westerns that helped define that genre for the future."
"3191","tt0043137","6933","2","Until that time Stewart was mainly noted for an aw..aw..aw approach to family oriented comedies, dramas, and romances."
"3192","tt0043137","6933","3","Not that he wasn't already a multi talented Hollywood star."
"3193","tt0043137","6933","4","One of his best screen performances ever and one of the best for anyone on celluloid was as Macaulay 'Mike' Connor, a sarcastic writer for a scandal rag in ""The Philadelphia Story."""

"3195","tt0043137","6933","6","His portrayal of gun shy yet expert shot Thomas Jefferson Destry Jr. in the comedy western ""Destry Rides Again"" helped make that film a classic."

"3202","tt0043137","6933","13","""Winchester '73"" and ""The Man from Laramie"" were the best but the others were almost as effective."
"3203","tt0043137","6933","14","Mann became a successful director of A films as a result going on to direct what some critics believe to be the greatest western of them all Gary Cooper's ""Man of the West."""
"3204","tt0043137","6933","15","Stewart became fabulously wealthy as a result of the partnership because he signed for part of the royalties in return for a fraction of the salary he was usually paid, a wise move indeed followed by many other actors from then on."
"3205","tt0043137","6933","16","Winchester '73 was also one of the first films, maybe the first, to tell a story from the standpoint of a traveling gun."

"3228","tt0043137","6934","2","It's not your everyday western it uses a rifle, which passes hands from various characters as a mechanism for telling the story about these people."
"3229","tt0043137","6934","3","Rock Hudson plays an indian chief, Jimmy Stewart plays a great leading man with heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a gal who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west."

"3240","tt0043137","6935","7","The end showdown is a classic a tense rifle battle fought at long range in and around a rocky outcrop."

"3243","tt0043137","6936","1","Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after WWII."
"3244","tt0043137","6936","2","Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction."
"3245","tt0043137","6936","3","Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured Winchester 73 going to the winner."
"3246","tt0043137","6936","4","This is a good script with several stories going on at the same time."
"3247","tt0043137","6936","5","Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull."
"3248","tt0043137","6936","6","Thank God, with in a few years, we would begin to let Indians play themselves in western films."
"3249","tt0043137","6936","7","The film is in black and white and was shot in Tucson Arizona."
"3250","tt0043137","6936","8","I would not put Winchester 73 in the category of Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane, but it gets an above average recommendation from me.."
"3251","tt0043137","6937","1","This stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all."

"3257","tt0043137","6937","7","Flippen."
"3258","tt0043137","6937","8","Shelley Winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure."
"3259","tt0043137","6937","9","Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, teen heartthrobs in later years, have brief but good roles."
"3260","tt0043137","6938","1","For the viewer who comes upon it long after its making, ""Winchester '73"" has something in common with ""Casablanca."""
"3261","tt0043137","6938","2","While you watch it, you get this feeling that you're looking at a string of clichés encountered so often in the genre; then you realise that the clichés became clichés only after being copied from this particular film, and that they were so widely copied because this film was so great."
"3262","tt0043137","6938","3","In other words, it's a seminal work."""
"3263","tt0043137","6938","4","Winchester '73"" is a joy to watch."
"3264","tt0043137","6938","5","The broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but mostly because you've seen them copied so many times in later movies, and nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you."
"3265","tt0043137","6938","6","The dialogue, the pacing and Mann's direction are excellent."
"3266","tt0043137","6938","7","Stewart shines in particular, and if you're a fan this is a ""must see,"" but he is not alone in delivering a good performance."

"3273","tt0043137","6939","3","I say that for the whole thing: the acting, mature dialog, no nonsense story and excellent cinematography."
"3274","tt0043137","6939","4","Director Anthony Mann, who did several well photographed film noirs around this same era, also made some westerns such as this one."

"3285","tt0043137","6939","15","It was a bit of a stretch, however, to see Rock Hudson playing an Indian ""Young Bull"", but you can't have everything."
"3286","tt0043137","6940","1","In 1942 a film TALES OF MANHATTAN told a set of stories that were basically unrelated, but tied together with a suit of men's evening wear."
"3287","tt0043137","6940","2","Each story began when the ""tails"" were passed from one owner Charles Boyer, for instance to another Ceasar Romero."
"3288","tt0043137","6940","3","WINCHESTER '73, a superior film, and a great western, has a similar plot twist."
"3289","tt0043137","6940","4","Initially it is about how Jimmy Stewart is seeking Stephen Horace MacMahon for some deadly grudge."
"3290","tt0043137","6940","5","But in the course of the film the two men get into a shooting contest, the prize given by Marshall Wyatt Earp Will Geer being one of the new Winchester rifles."
"3291","tt0043137","6940","6","Stewart barely beats out MacMahon, but the gun is stolen from Stewart, and the chase is on."
"3292","tt0043137","6940","7","The gun passes from hand to hand, including John McIntyre as an arrogant trader who fatally does not know when to stop being arrogant, to Rock Hudson in a surprising role and a brief one at that, to Charles Drake, to Dan Duryea as the delightfully deadly and psychotic Waco Johnny Dean, to MacMahon."
"3293","tt0043137","6940","8","Eventually it does return to Stewart."
"3294","tt0043137","6940","9","The film is expertly directed by Anthony Mann."

"3301","tt0043137","6940","16","The characters are remarkably human."
"3302","tt0043137","6940","17","Winters first appears as the future bride of Drake, but she sees a really big negative side to him an unforgivable side."
"3303","tt0043137","6940","18","Drake is aware of this lapse, and it helps lead to his destruction."
"3304","tt0043137","6940","19","Other characters have realistic touches, such as J.C."
"3305","tt0043137","6940","20","Flippen as an army sergeant who fights an Indian attack with Steward and Steward's friend Millard Mitchell."
"3306","tt0043137","6940","21","Oh yes, and with Flippen's fellow soldier Tony Curtis."
"3307","tt0043137","6940","22","Flippen makes one believe this soldier has been on a hundred battlefields before, since 1861 probably."
"3308","tt0043137","6940","23","Steward had showed emotions in other films."
"3309","tt0043137","6940","24","In IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE he showed a degree of anger at times, and also a near nervous breakdown when he thinks everything is wrong with his life."
"3310","tt0043137","6940","25","But here he showed a demonic anger at the expense of a surprised Duryea who normally would show such anger himself."
"3311","tt0043137","6940","26","The parts of this film fit very neatly together, under Mann's competent hands."
"3312","tt0043137","6940","27","This is one western that never wears out, as the audience watches the travels of a Winchester rifle."
"3313","tt0043137","6941","1","Buffs of the adult western that flourished in the 1950s try and trace its origins to the film that kicked off the syndrome."
"3314","tt0043137","6941","2","Of course, we can go back to Howard Hawks's Red River 1948 or further still to John Ford's My Darling Clementine 1946, but if we want to stick with this single decade, then it has to be one of a couple of films made in that era's initial year."
"3315","tt0043137","6941","3","One is ""The Gunfighter,"" an exquisitely grim tale of a famed gunslinger Ringo facing his last shootout."
"3316","tt0043137","6941","4","Another from that same year is ""Winchester '73,"" and it's worth noting that Millard Mitchell appears in both as grim, mustached, highly realistic range riders."
"3317","tt0043137","6941","5","In The Gunfighter, he's the town marshal expected to arrest Ringo but once rode with him in an outlaw gang."
"3318","tt0043137","6941","6","In Winchester, he's the sidekick to Jimmy Stewart, a kind of Horatio to Stewart's Hamlet in this epic/tragic tale."
"3319","tt0043137","6941","7","The plot is simple enough: Stewart's lonesome cowpoke wins a remarkable Winchester in a shooting match, beating the meanest man in the west Stephen McNally, who is actually his own brother and caused the death of their father."
"3320","tt0043137","6941","8","When the brother steals the gun, Stewart and Mitchell go after him in a cowboy odyssey that takes them all across the frontier, meeting up with both outlaws and Indians."
"3321","tt0043137","6941","9","In one wonderful bit, two future stars Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis play an Indian chief and a U.S. cavalry soldier during a well staged pitched battle."
"3322","tt0043137","6941","10","Dan Duryea steals the whole show as a giggling outlaw leader, while Shelly Winters, just before she began to gain weight, is fine as the shady lady who ties all the plots together."
"3323","tt0043137","6941","11","Today, filmmakers would go on for about four hours to bring such an ambitious idea to the screen, but Anthony Mann does so in an extremely economical amount of time, with not a minute wasted."
"3324","tt0043137","6941","12","Such western legends as Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp terrifically played by Will Geer make brief appearances, adding to the historicity as well as the epic nature."
"3325","tt0043137","6941","13","The final battle between good and bad brothers, high atop a series of jutting rock canyons, is now legendary among western buffs."
"3326","tt0043137","6941","14","It's also worth noting that Stewart, however much associated he became with western films, does what is actually his first western leading man role here yes, he was in Destry Rides Again eleven years earlier, but was cast in that comedy spoof because he seemed so WRONG for westerns!"
"3327","tt0043137","6942","1","In the fifties the age restrictions for films in Brazil were the following: no restriction, 10 years old, 14 years old and 18 years old."
"3328","tt0043137","6942","2","Usually the westerns were allowed for ten years old, when they had a bit more of violence they would go to 14, but it was rare to see a western restricted for younger than 18."
"3329","tt0043137","6942","3","Winchester 73 was one of those, and I think this explains very well how this film was considered different from average."
"3330","tt0043137","6942","4","The hero, James Stewart was fighting against his own brother who had killed their father."
"3331","tt0043137","6942","5","He was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized, far from the average good guy."
"3332","tt0043137","6942","6","Anthony Mann tried variations on this type of character in the next films he did with Stewart."
"3333","tt0043137","6942","7","Shelley Winters, the leading lady was far from virtuous, she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle."
"3334","tt0043137","6942","8","Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains that will always be remembered."
"3335","tt0043137","6942","9","The story of the film, which always follows the man who stays with the rifle, is one of the best suited for a western."
"3336","tt0043137","6942","10","It was to be made into a Fritz Lang film, which did not come through."
"3337","tt0043137","6942","11","When it was offered to Mann he made a point of starting from zero again and not taking anything that was prepared for Lang."
"3338","tt0043137","6942","12","With Winchester, Mann created a different conception of western, but still maintaining all its traditions."
"3339","tt0043137","6942","13","Winchester still is a great film to see again and again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made in those who saw it when it was originally released."
"3340","tt0043137","6943","1","The traditional Western is synonymous with wide open spaces, clearcut morality, inevitable storylines, the optimistic faith in a hero's ability to shape his own destiny, to escape his past."
"3341","tt0043137","6943","2","These qualities reflect directly the American sense of self, the self shaping Dream, the pushing of boundaries and frontiers, which is why the genre is still alluded to by opportunistic politicians."
"3342","tt0043137","6943","3","With some noble exceptions eg Wellman, Hawks, the Western was healthily free of neuroses or real anxiety."
"3343","tt0043137","6943","4","Anthony Mann changed all that forever, and this first foray into the genre is one of the most violent, vivid, complex, not to say exciting Westerns ever made."
"3344","tt0043137","6943","5","The traditional Western depends on a hero who exemplifies rugged wholesomeness, whatever misfortunes he may have had in the past, a supporter of order and right, who dominates the film, removes its obstacles, restores harmony in effect; and an obvious villain, who often, ironically, drives the plot, forces the hero into certain actions."
"3345","tt0043137","6943","6","The difference between the two is often delineated as mythically simple as the wearing of white or black hats."
"3346","tt0043137","6943","7","Mann's background was in film noir, a genre antithetical to wide open spaces and optimism."
"3347","tt0043137","6943","8","Noir was neurotically charged, focusing on the dissolution of an unstable protagonist, where morality is blurred, the hero is as often the villain, trapped in an interior labyrinth of his own making, a passive victim to destiny."
"3348","tt0043137","6943","9","Noir is about regress not progress, the interrogating and denying of modes and signs of representation, not the creation and confirmation of them."
"3349","tt0043137","6943","10","WINCHESTER 73 is fraught with noir anxiety."
"3350","tt0043137","6943","11","Noir is often considered a psychological genre, visualising the traumas of its protagonist's head. 73 does this too, and is all the more disturbing in that that protagonist is lovely, homespun Jimmy Stewart, initiating here his great run of difficult films with Mann and Hitchcock."
"3351","tt0043137","6943","12","In many ways, good natured and sweet, representing right and trying to restore disruptions to the natural order, he is also a near lunatic who will stop at nothing to achieve murderous revenge, whose relentless quest mirrors Ethan Edwards in THE SEARCHERS in its inhuman persistance, whose human instincts are frayed by this quest, and whose bursts of violence are genuinely terrifying to witness."
"3352","tt0043137","6943","13","As in noir, his anxiety has a psychological base unlike most 'healthy' heroes who have outgrown symbolically killed their fathers, McAdam's father was killed before he could complete the process; his chasing his brother is less moral revenge than an anguished protest against stunted growth."
"3353","tt0043137","6943","14","The climactic shoot out is not cathartic: McAdam staggers back into 'normal' society, like he's just witnessed some of the world's most ghastly horrors."
"3354","tt0043137","6943","15","What is most unsettling about the film is that it's not really about a hero or a villain at all, but an inanimate piece of weoponry that drives the action. 73 opens with the gun of the title privileged, on display behind a glass window, while its admirers are trapped, squashed, undifferentiated, framed, admiring it outside."
"3355","tt0043137","6943","16","Throughout the film, human power is reduced to the most arbitrary of signifiers names change; Lin and Dutch mime shooting each other because they've no guns; quests lose their moral vitality and their practitioners veer close to madness; armies have to ask for help from Confederate strangers to fight battles; a man becomes worthy of respect only when he mentions his name; another man is revealed as a coward when he abandons his fiancee to the Indians; the gun retains its prestige, power, wholeness."
"3356","tt0043137","6943","17","It's not the revenge plot which drives the film, but the story of the gun; this wrenches the film out of conventional expectations, and creates an eerie, alienating, modern feel."
"3357","tt0043137","6943","18","We become so caught up in the revenge plot that when we follow, with the gun, another plot entirely, we feel slightly bewildered."
"3358","tt0043137","6943","19","This emphasis on the gun, symbol of potent masculinity, actually allows for a critique of that masculinity, revealing pointless elaborate rituals at the expense of society and order; brute capitalist greed; murderous Indian traders who defraud both seller and enemy; cowards; psychotic killers; before returning to its 'true' owner, a broken hero thoroughly compromised, who has become as murderous as the murderer he seeks."
"3359","tt0043137","6943","20","The gun is never imprinted with the name of its owner, not only because there is no fixed owner, but because there is no fixed masculinity, an insight anathema to the traditional Western.73 brilliantly invokes Western myths Wyatt Earp, Dodge City, the Cavalry, the Civil War, the wide open West only to undermine them."
"3360","tt0043137","6943","21","Earp has an inflated reputation that is all name but never proven Dodge City is no safer against outlaws than anywhere else; the Cavalry is inept Custer has just lost Little Big Horn and the bitter feud of the War is shown to be irrelevant."
"3361","tt0043137","6943","22","The myth of the open West is a site for a very closed, inescapable, circular plot which traps its characters, refuses to allow them shape their destiny, but allowing it to shape them."
"3362","tt0043137","6943","23","The old John Ford silhouette of riders on a vast mountain is reprised, but signals here not progress but repetition and circularity."
"3363","tt0043137","6943","24","But for all its deconstruction, the film is also tangibly vivid in a way few Westerns ever achieve."
"3364","tt0043137","6943","25","Mann's incisive technique intrudes his camera in crucial positions, alternating revealing distance with intense examination, making the saloon doors and stagecoaches seem thrillingly alive and lived in."
"3365","tt0043137","6944","1","For Anthony Mann the Western was 'legend' and 'legend' makes the very best cinema!"
"3366","tt0043137","6944","2","Mann's work was full of intensities and passions, visually dramatic, and the action always excitingly photographed..."
"3367","tt0043137","6944","3","Stewart, a docile actor with the ability of displaying anger, neurosis and cruelty, made with Anthony Mann, five remarkable Westerns: ""Winchester '73;"" "" Bend of the River;"" ""The Naked Spur;"" ""The Far Country;"" and ""The Man from Laramie."""
"3368","tt0043137","6944","4","In ""Winchester '73,"" Stewart reveals his darker side..."
"3369","tt0043137","6944","5","He offers all the reserves of anger, inner ambivalence, and emotional complexity in his nature that his audiences had, up till this time, failed to catch..."
"3370","tt0043137","6944","6","A carefully chosen cast increases the proceedings in fine style: Shelley Winters is at her saucy best; Dan Duryea perfect as the vicious, sneering psychopathic villain; John McIntire great as the unscrupulous character; Charles Drake so good as the man who attempts to face his tormentor; and a very young Rock Hudson, attempts the role of an Indian Chief..."
"3371","tt0043137","6944","7","""Winchester '73"" is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly prized, rifle in the Dodge City Kansas of 1876..."
"3372","tt0043137","6944","8","Stewart and his estranged brother, who bears another name Stephen McNally, compete fiercely for possession of it, and though Stewart wins, McNally steals it and sets off cross country with Stewart in pursuit..."
"3373","tt0043137","6944","9","What gives the pursuit an element of the demonic, is Stewart's determination to revenge his father's death at the hands of that same renegade brothera revenge fed by long standing fratricidal hatred..."
"3374","tt0043137","6944","10","Photographed in gorgeous Black & White, the film comes on as powerful and arresting, acted with deep feeling and intense concentration, not only by Stewart but by all the supporting characters..."
"3375","tt0043137","6944","11","Look fast for a promising newcomer, Tony Curtis, the soldier who finds the rifle after the Indian attack..."
"3376","tt0043137","6945","1","My favorite movie genre is the western, it's really the only movie genre that is of American origin."
"3377","tt0043137","6945","2","And despite Sergio Leone, no one does them quite like Americans."
"3378","tt0043137","6945","3","Right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is Winchester 73."
"3379","tt0043137","6945","4","It was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart."
"3380","tt0043137","6945","5","It was also a landmark film in which Stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from Universal."
"3381","tt0043137","6945","6","Many such deals followed for players, making them as rich as the moguls who employed them."
"3382","tt0043137","6945","7","Anthony Mann up to this point had done mostly B pictures, noir type stuff with no real budgets."
"3383","tt0043137","6945","8","Just before Winchester 73 Mann had done a fine western with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, that never gets enough praise."
"3384","tt0043137","6945","9","I'm sure James Stewart must have seen it and decided Mann was the person he decided to partner with."
"3385","tt0043137","6945","10","In this film Mann also developed a mini stock company the way John Ford was legendary for."
"3386","tt0043137","6945","11","Besides Stewart others in the cast like Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C."
"3387","tt0043137","6945","12","Flippen and Rock Hudson would appear in future Mann films."
"3388","tt0043137","6945","13","It's a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him."
"3389","tt0043137","6945","14","Why I won't say, but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of James Stewart on screen."
"3390","tt0043137","6945","15","Anthony Mann reached into Jimmy Stewart's soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we have."
"3391","tt0043137","6945","16","The hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film."
"3392","tt0043137","6945","17","After Stewart and sidekick Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer because guns aren't carried in Earp's Dodge City."
"3393","tt0043137","6945","18","There's a shooting contest for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the betting favorite is Dutch Henry Brown, played with menace by Stephen McNally."
"3394","tt0043137","6945","19","Stewart, Mitchell and Geer go into the saloon and Stewart and McNally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that aren't there."
"3395","tt0043137","6945","20","Look at the closeups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 pages of dialog."
"3396","tt0043137","6945","21","Another character Stewart runs into in the film is Waco Johnny Dean played by Dan Duryea who almost steals the film."
"3397","tt0043137","6945","22","This may have been Duryea's finest moment on screen."
"3398","tt0043137","6945","23","He's a psychopathic outlaw killer who's deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns."
"3399","tt0043137","6945","24","Another person Stewart meets is Shelley Winters who's fiancé is goaded into a showdown by Duryea and killed."
"3400","tt0043137","6945","25","Her best scenes are with Duryea who's taken a fancy to her."
"3401","tt0043137","6945","26","She plays for time until she can safely get away from him."
"3402","tt0043137","6945","27","Guess who she ultimately winds up with."
"3403","tt0043137","6945","28","There are some wonderful performances in some small roles, there ain't a sour note in the cast."
"3404","tt0043137","6945","29","John McIntire as a shifty Indian trader, Jay C."
"3405","tt0043137","6945","30","Flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and Rock Hudson got his first real notice as a young Indian chief."
"3406","tt0043137","6945","31","Even John Alexander, best known as 'Theodore Roosevelt' in Arsenic and Old Lace has a brief, but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at different times."
"3407","tt0043137","6945","32","Mann and Stewart did eight films together, five of them westerns, and were ready to do a sixth western, Night Passage when they quarreled and Mann walked off the set."
"3408","tt0043137","6945","33","The end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films."
"3409","tt0046187","4187","1","This is a pretty decent example of film noir."
"3410","tt0046187","4187","2","The setting is the early 50's with the Communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the US Government."
"3411","tt0046187","4187","3","Richard Widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples."
"3412","tt0046187","4187","4","He gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing A List about him."
"3413","tt0046187","4187","5","The interesting thing was that he was not only an anti hero but through most of the film, an unlikeable anti hero."
"3414","tt0046187","4187","6","That is not very normal."
"3415","tt0046187","4187","7","Jean Peters gave a so so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold."
"3416","tt0046187","4187","8","That great character actress Thelma Ritter shines as the stool pigeon."
"3417","tt0046187","4187","9","The plot had its fair share of twists and turns, wisecracks and tough talk."
"3418","tt0046187","4187","10","There is a fight scene near the end of the movie in the subway station that was pretty gritty and exciting."
"3419","tt0046187","4187","11","I think noir fans like myself will enjoy this film."
"3420","tt0046187","4187","12","For non noir viewers, it may seem a little dated and the whole Commie thing a tad overdone."
"3421","tt0046187","4188","1","Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films."
"3422","tt0046187","4188","2","While ""Shock Corridor"" and ""The Naked Kiss"" represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of America and ""The Big Red One"" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, ""Merrill's Marauders"" painted war as necessary hell and ""Pickup on South Street"" is about the dangers of communist spies."
"3423","tt0046187","4188","3","All of his films make for very entertaining viewing, and even though he was often pigeonholed as a b filmmaker, Fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors."
"3424","tt0046187","4188","4","""Pickup on South Street"" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the film making style is remarkably ahead of its time."
"3425","tt0046187","4188","5","Its also a very quickly pace, tight, and occasionally brutal film noir."
"3426","tt0046187","4188","6","The acting across the board is fantastic."
"3427","tt0046187","4188","7","Richard Widmark makes for a great anti hero and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend."
"3428","tt0046187","4188","8","The show stealer is Thlema Ritter however, in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie."
"3429","tt0046187","4188","9","The angles Fuller employs are great, making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal this is very violent for its time."
"3430","tt0046187","4188","10","The camera continuously moves around just as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later."
"3431","tt0046187","4188","11","""Pickup on South Street"" is a great action paced noir thriller."
"3432","tt0046187","4188","12","""Shock Corridor"" remains my favorite Fuller film, but this is a very close second."
"3433","tt0046187","4188","13","8/10"
"3434","tt0046187","4189","1","Richard Widmark is a tainted character in this movie."
"3435","tt0046187","4189","2","He is a professional pickpocket."
"3436","tt0046187","4189","3","He's been in prison three times, yet at the beginning of the film, he tries to make it four."
"3437","tt0046187","4189","4","Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody."
"3438","tt0046187","4189","5","Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark."
"3439","tt0046187","4189","6","This is a period piece during the McCarthy era where the Red Scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely."
"3440","tt0046187","4189","7","What is unusual about this film is that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films."
"3441","tt0046187","4189","8","This is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film."
"3442","tt0046187","4189","9","The film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as the under card for double features in the theater."
"3443","tt0046187","4189","10","The sets show it is a limited budget film."
"3444","tt0046187","4189","11","The script made J Edgar Hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift."
"3445","tt0046187","4189","12","Hoover wanted it changed."
"3446","tt0046187","4189","13","Instead, it became a B under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953."
"3447","tt0046187","4189","14","The script & acting in it are better than other big features were that year."
"3448","tt0046187","4190","1","Thelma Ritter did steal the picture."
"3449","tt0046187","4190","2","I just finished watching it again."
"3450","tt0046187","4190","3","I couldn't help becoming emotional in her final scene."
"3451","tt0046187","4190","4","She didn't get the Oscar."
"3452","tt0046187","4190","5","That's why you shouldn't put too much faith in Oscars."
"3453","tt0046187","4190","6","Richard Widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3 D, flawed human being."
"3454","tt0046187","4190","7","Jean Peters was great as the streetwise, tough girl in her best role ever."
"3455","tt0046187","4190","8","And Richard Kiley must have been very good; why else would I have hated him so."
"3456","tt0046187","4190","9","Yes, it was heavy handed on the patriotism; but, without it, you don't have much of a film."
"3457","tt0046187","4190","10","Watch their faces!"
"3458","tt0046187","4190","11","The top three stars didn't really need much script."
"3459","tt0046187","4190","12","I would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue."
"3460","tt0046187","4190","13","If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in ""The Thief"", maybe you know what I mean."
"3461","tt0046187","4190","14","When I was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to NYC, I made my Bronx uncle drive us to the foot of South Street looking for No."
"3462","tt0046187","4190","15","66."
"3463","tt0046187","4190","16","That's when I knew that Hollywood couldn't be trusted."
"3464","tt0046187","4190","17","But I did find the river."
"3465","tt0046187","4190","18","I'm not giving away much of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it for myself."
"3466","tt0046187","4190","19","If you have seen it, no elucidation is necessary."
"3467","tt0046187","4190","20","Just maybe, someone who is reading these comments hasn't seen ""Pickup On South Street""."
"3468","tt0046187","4190","21","You will like it; just don't go looking for 66 South Street in New York City."
"3469","tt0046187","4191","1","This 1953 Sam Fuller movie contains some of his best work, and its sad that he couldn't continue to get the backing of major Hollywood studios to do his stuff."
"3470","tt0046187","4191","2","The story line goes something like this."
"3471","tt0046187","4191","3","A tough hard broad read prostitute is riding the subway one hot summer day, and gets her pocketbook picked by Skip McCoy."
"3472","tt0046187","4191","4","What Skip and the dame don't realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spies."
"3473","tt0046187","4191","5","This opening shot without dialogue, and mostly in tight close ups is a beaut,one of the many that Fuller uses throughout the movie."
"3474","tt0046187","4191","6","Playing the babe known as Candy is Jean Peters, who was never better nor better looking."
"3475","tt0046187","4191","7","One forgets how beautiful she was, and she handles this role very well."
"3476","tt0046187","4191","8","The Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark, who had already made his mark, and set his style with 1947's Kiss Of Death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh, and although he's a little ""softer"" here, he's still scary."
"3477","tt0046187","4191","9","These hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there, but its noir and nasty all the way."
"3478","tt0046187","4191","10","The standout performance belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter,who plays Moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral."
"3479","tt0046187","4191","11","Ritter received a well deserved Oscar nomination for her performance, but lost out to the boring but popular performance of Donna Reed as the B girl read prostitute in ""From Here To Eternity."""
"3480","tt0046187","4191","12","Hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad, and loves to Oscar them even though their performance is usually awful."
"3481","tt0046187","4191","13","See for instance Shirley Jones in ""Elmer Gantry."
"3482","tt0046187","4191","14","Set among the docks and dives of New York City, with crisp black and white photography by the great Joe MacDonald,and some very good art direction."
"3483","tt0046187","4191","15","Especially good is the set representing the New York City subways and Widmark's shack near the river."
"3484","tt0046187","4191","16","Made at the height of the cold war and red scare, the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie, played by Richard Kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal American."
"3485","tt0046187","4192","1","In what will probably find itself on my list of Fuller's best movies that is, once I see more of them that just this and Shock Corridor, Pickup on South Street is a film noir where the femme fatale, as well as the male protagonist, are not the stereotypical ones in the genre."
"3486","tt0046187","4192","2","Like most of his other works, Fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of New York style that is usually absent in the Hollywood noirs."
"3487","tt0046187","4192","3","On a small budget at least for the likes of Darryl F."
"3488","tt0046187","4192","4","Zanuck Fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere."
"3489","tt0046187","4192","5","The good guys are basically the ones who won't get violent with you even as they're looking for an extra buck."
"3490","tt0046187","4192","6","Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter are all terrific in the lead parts."
"3491","tt0046187","4192","7","Widmark is one only a few actors I can think of who could've really pulled off this character."
"3492","tt0046187","4192","8","He's a little like Bugs Bunny, as he can be a wise ass who is a little sneaky."
"3493","tt0046187","4192","9","On the other hand, the character of Skip McCoy does have a set of values in his life."
"3494","tt0046187","4192","10","He doesn't go into other people's affairs, and doesn't try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river, after being sent away for three years."
"3495","tt0046187","4192","11","He slips up, unbeknownst to him, when he pickpockets a woman Peters on the train, and lifts an item that's under the eye of the Government."
"3496","tt0046187","4192","12","It may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money."
"3497","tt0046187","4192","13","But at what cost is the centerpiece of the film, as it involves stoolie Moe Ritter is one of the finest, and most believable, character actors from the period, the woman's ex a volatile Kiley, and the police department."
"3498","tt0046187","4192","14","Aside from the thematic elements, which are told with a keen dramatic, journalistic style as was Fuller's previous position, along with boxer, the dialog is fresh and involving."
"3499","tt0046187","4192","15","There's a spontaneity in many of Fuller's camera moves."
"3500","tt0046187","4192","16","And what a third act."
"3501","tt0046187","4192","17","This is a lean, tight film noir that is worth checking out even if you're not familiar with Fuller it's comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works."
"3502","tt0046187","4193","1","Director Sam Fuller has something of a cult following, particularly in Europe."
"3503","tt0046187","4193","2","Yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable."
"3504","tt0046187","4193","3","He did however direct one really terrific movie in ""Pickup on South Street""."
"3505","tt0046187","4193","4","Made pretty early on in his career, the movies that followed were vastly inferior."
"3506","tt0046187","4193","5","From the first to the last frame, ""Pickup"" works on all levels."
"3507","tt0046187","4193","6","It's filmed with flawless fluidity, boasting fine performances all round."
"3508","tt0046187","4193","7","Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances, are at their peak."
"3509","tt0046187","4193","8","Widmark, who was no stranger at playing villains, while truly mean to the core, still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making Jean Peters character's falling for him all the more credible."
"3510","tt0046187","4193","9","Fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie."
"3511","tt0046187","4193","10","There is a scene in which Jean Peters get roughed up by Widmark."
"3512","tt0046187","4193","11","It's truly shocking in its reality."
"3513","tt0046187","4193","12","This is not a case of carefully choreographed photography."
"3514","tt0046187","4193","13","Less self conscious than many film noir's of the period this remains a great example of the genre."
"3515","tt0046187","4194","1","Samuel Fuller brings his customary playful and stylish direction to this seedy, pulpy story and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of 1950s cinema."
"3516","tt0046187","4194","2","Richard Widmark plays a petty thief tough guy a role he perfected over the course of many movies, who snatches a young lady's Jean Peters wallet on a New York subway and with it a piece of much wanted microfilm."
"3517","tt0046187","4194","3","This is 1953, so of course the microfilm is property of Commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back."
"3518","tt0046187","4194","4","When the girl shows up at Widmark's waterfront shack, sent by an abusive boyfriend to reclaim the film, Widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her ""comrades"" down for big money."
"3519","tt0046187","4194","5","The plot thickens, people start dying, and Widmark and Peters fall in love."
"3520","tt0046187","4194","6","Fuller handles the love story clumsily, but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction."
"3521","tt0046187","4194","7","It's as if he included a love story under duress, and so made it intentionally unbelievable, as love stories so frequently were and still are in Hollywood films."
"3522","tt0046187","4194","8","Peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough New Yawk cookie, part gangster moll and part damsel in distress."
"3523","tt0046187","4194","9","When violence occurs against her, we genuinely care about her well being, and it's typical of Fuller's renegade, ahead of his time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion."
"3524","tt0046187","4194","10","But the ultimate success of ""Pickup on South Street"" rests squarely on the world weary shoulders of Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, a feisty lady who makes money any way she can, whether that be selling neckties or acting as a police informant."
"3525","tt0046187","4194","11","Ritter gives the performance of her career; in a breathtaking monologue, she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad trajectory of her character's life, and the hopelessness she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle, crime and hardship."
"3526","tt0046187","4194","12","It's as if every character Ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to vent in those other movies."
"3527","tt0046187","4194","13","The scene is the highlight of Fuller's film, and a highlight of 50s cinema, period."
"3528","tt0046187","4194","14","Grade: A+"
"3529","tt0046187","4195","1","This film is a spicy little piece of film making from Sam Fuller which gives Richard Widmark the chance to show of some of his best, most edgy acting in the role of Skip McCoy, a small time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful Candy's Jean Peters pocket on a crowded bus."
"3530","tt0046187","4195","2","It turns out Candy was doing a favor for her ex.boyfriend, who's working for the ""commies""."
"3531","tt0046187","4195","3","Superficially, there's a mystery here regarding Candy's motives and Skip spends much of the film determining her motives ."
"3532","tt0046187","4195","4","Actually he seems to just initially assume that she's a ""commie"", going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture."
"3533","tt0046187","4195","5","But the real question is  what's going on with Skip."
"3534","tt0046187","4195","6","What are his motives, and why does Candy like him so much."
"3535","tt0046187","4195","7","Why do we the audience want to like him so much."
"3536","tt0046187","4195","8","Basically what the film makers have done here is create a very striking ""male fatale"" in Widmark's character and his performance."
"3537","tt0046187","4195","9","Just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like ""The Big Sleep"" or ""The Glass Key"" along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face, the film makers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers."
"3538","tt0046187","4195","10","Widmark is handsome, and there's also a charm in his boyish insouciance  but the first two times he meets our leading lady, he robs her and then punches her in the face."
"3539","tt0046187","4195","11","Eventually the question becomes  would Skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck his comments to the police, like ""you're waving a flag at ME."" make us suspect he would or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend Moe Thelma Ritter."
"3540","tt0046187","4195","12","I'm not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way."
"3541","tt0046187","4195","13","Thelma Ritter's character work deserves special mention  she has created a truly indelible character here."
"3542","tt0046187","4195","14","Fuller isn't afraid to give her plenty of ""business""  in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world, particularly her used ties."
"3543","tt0046187","4195","15","Another example of Fuller's ""business"" would be the scene with Victor Perry an actor I've seen elsewhere used to less effect using the chopsticks to intimidate Candy."
"3544","tt0046187","4195","16","The emphasis on Moe's relationship with Skip provides one of cinema's most revealing ""honor among thieves"" themes."
"3545","tt0046187","4195","17","In fact Skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police, with the notable exception of Capt."
"3546","tt0046187","4195","18","Tiger Murvyn Vye who has a grudge against him."
"3547","tt0046187","4195","19","I loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack."
"3548","tt0046187","4195","20","Those are the kind of details that make this film feel real  whether or not it really is ""realistic"" or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions."
"3549","tt0046187","4195","21","All told, I would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the ""film noir"" school of film making."
"3550","tt0046187","4195","22","A predictable plot is off set by a host of colorful characters uniformly well performed, cheap sets are disguised by the film's unrelenting pace, and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is."
"3551","tt0046187","4195","23","This is the best film I've seen so far by Sam Fuller and helps me to see better why he's regarded as a master director  here he accomplished some things that I think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like ""The Crimson Kimono"" and ""Shock Corridor"" as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense."
"3552","tt0046187","4195","24","This is one of my favorite performances from Widmark that I've seen so far  and Widmark was a talent that I'm tempted to say based on the few extraordinary films I've seen with him was comparable to that of Alan Ladd or Humphrey Bogart, although arguably he didn't make as many classic films."
"3553","tt0046187","4196","1","This crime thriller is sort of like a film noir, though changes the context from post war to Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity."
"3554","tt0046187","4196","2","In ""Pickup on South Street"", policemen are good guys, criminals are genuine guys, and the only enemies are ""The Commies"", who are ultimately differentiated from the good guys in that they are emotionally personable, driven by an actual care for their own worth, as shown in the constant tracked in close ups that speckle the movie."
"3555","tt0046187","4196","3","This movie revolves around characters."
"3556","tt0046187","4196","4","The personalities in this film are rather unique and detailed: Skip the pick pocket who is able to stare down any danger, and sometimes while going through their personal possessions; Moe the informer who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of nearly all the other characters and the audience; Candy, the ill named innocent girl who only thinks she's doing government work and doesn't fully comprehend the conspiracy she's involved with; and Joey, the ex boyfriend evil Commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everybody and, ironically, is the worst person at doing it."
"3557","tt0046187","4196","5","Throw in a bunch of very colorful supporting characters such as the guy with the chopsticks and the policemen and ""Pickup on South Street"" treats you to a splendor of personalities as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames."
"3558","tt0046187","4196","6","PolarisDiB"
"3559","tt0046187","4197","1","'Shock Corridor 1963' was my first film from Samuel Fuller, and there I was impressed with the director's astute blending of B movie and big budget aesthetics, even if the story itself was pure schlock."
"3560","tt0046187","4197","2","'Pickup on South Street 1953' was released a decade earlier in Fuller's career, obviously produced on a larger budget from a big name studio, Twentieth Century Fox."
"3561","tt0046187","4197","3","Nevertheless, the visuals are still notable in that there's a somewhat raw, naturalistic element to the photography, not unlike Dassin's 'The Night and the City 1950' and Kazan's 'Panic in the Streets 1950' the latter was also shot by cinematographer Joe McDonald."
"3562","tt0046187","4197","4","In some scenes, Fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors' faces that they're out of focus, bluntly registering the intimate thoughts, emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features, the eye."
"3563","tt0046187","4197","5","Though unexpectedly prone to melodrama, and with just a hint of anti Communist propaganda, 'Pickup on South Street' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of New York City."
"3564","tt0046187","4197","6","When just out of prison pickpocket Skip McCoy Richard Widmark snags the purse of a woman on the subway Jean Peters, he pockets more than he'd originally bargained for."
"3565","tt0046187","4197","7","The woman, Candy, and her cowardly ex boyfriend Joey Richard Kiley had been smuggling top secret information to the Communists, and McKoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro film."
"3566","tt0046187","4197","8","Will he turn in the MacGuffin to the proper authorities, or sell it to the highest bidder."
"3567","tt0046187","4197","9","If 'Pickup on South Street' has a flaw, it's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti Communist agenda, reeking of propaganda like nothing since WWII Dwight Taylor, who supplied the story, also notably wrote 'The Thin Man Goes Home 1944,' the only propagandistic movie of the series."
"3568","tt0046187","4197","10","For no apparent reason, every identifiable character  even the smugly self serving Skip McCoy  eventually becomes a self sacrificing patriot, the transformation predictable from the outset."
"3569","tt0046187","4197","11","In traditional film noir, the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance, the rational punishment for his sins, but apparently not when they've served their country; patriotism wipes the slate clean."
"3570","tt0046187","4197","12","Richard Widmark, an actor who I'm really beginning to like, plays the haughty pickpocket with composure, though always with that hint of ill ease that suggests he's biting off more than he can chew."
"3571","tt0046187","4197","13","The opening scene on the train is the film's finest, as McCoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim's hand bag, recalling Bresson's 'Pickpocket 1959.'"
"3572","tt0046187","4197","14","Thelma Ritter is terrific as a tired street woman who'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it though, of course, she draws the line at Commies."
"3573","tt0046187","4197","15","Jean Peters is well cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side, playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour; Fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow legged strut of a prostitute."
"3574","tt0046187","4197","16","Nevertheless, Peters must suffer a contrived love affair with Widmark that really brings down the film's attempts at realism."
"3575","tt0046187","4197","17","Fascinatingly, upon its release, 'Pickup on South Street' was promptly condemned as Communist propaganda by the FBI, and the Communist Party condemned it for being the exact opposite."
"3576","tt0046187","4197","18","Go figure."
"3577","tt0046187","4198","1","From the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work RICHARD WIDMARK stealing from a woman's purse JEAN PETERS, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is relentlessly fascinating to watch."
"3578","tt0046187","4198","2","Partly it's because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast, the B&W photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters, and because Samuel Fuller's direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like John ASPHALT JUNGLE Huston."
"3579","tt0046187","4198","3","In fact, it has the same urgency as the Huston film about a heist that goes wrong but the payoff is not quite as strong."
"3580","tt0046187","4198","4","JEAN PETERS is excellent as the hard edged girl whom Widmark describes as being ""knocked around a lot""."
"3581","tt0046187","4198","5","She gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a micro film in her purse for her boyfriend RICHARD KILEY, something the FBI already knows about."
"3582","tt0046187","4198","6","They're on her trail when the theft occurs."
"3583","tt0046187","4198","7","THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman called ""Moe"" who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life."
"3584","tt0046187","4198","8","She's particularly touching in her final scene with Kiley."
"3585","tt0046187","4198","9","This one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time."
"3586","tt0046187","4198","10","Good noir from Fox and notable for the performances of Widmark, Peters and Ritter."
"3587","tt0046187","4199","1","The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive."
"3588","tt0046187","4199","2","It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter."
"3589","tt0046187","4199","3","Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much."
"3590","tt0046187","4199","4","That's the case here for an 80 minute black and white, mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography wise."
"3591","tt0046187","4199","5","The story is the story here as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc. as a pickpocket Widmark inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. say that three times!."
"3592","tt0046187","4199","6","Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant."
"3593","tt0046187","4199","7","She and Widmark are the stars of this film."
"3594","tt0046187","4199","8","Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her."
"3595","tt0046187","4199","9","Only in world of film!!"
"3596","tt0046187","4199","10","Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it."
"3597","tt0046187","4199","11","This an average film noir which means good, but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25 $35."
"3598","tt0046187","4199","12","For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market."
"3599","tt0046187","4200","1","Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: A ""Red Scare"" movie devoid of hysteria, in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot."
"3600","tt0046187","4200","2","Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm; unbeknownst to either of them, it harbors secrets vital to the Cold War."
"3601","tt0046187","4200","3","Peters, as it happens, was under surveillance by FBI agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who's running her, cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley."
"3602","tt0046187","4200","4","In trying to retrieve the precious film, both sides enlist the help of Thelma Ritter, a streetwise old jane who's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears."
"3603","tt0046187","4200","5","Fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story, which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality."
"3604","tt0046187","4200","6","From the subways to the waterfront, his midsummer Manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that's almost pungent."
"3605","tt0046187","4200","7","The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender, and they're scored to ""Again,"" a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House, also starring Widmark."
"3606","tt0046187","4200","8","The pace slackens for Ritter's beautifully written and played death scene among the most poignant vignettes in all noir, and a kind of mirage oasis in a film parched of sentimentality."
"3607","tt0046187","4200","9","This is writer/director Fuller's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle; his later explorations of American pathology The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld U.S.A. never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street."
"3608","tt0046187","4201","1","Pickup on South Street 1953, directed by movie maverick Samuel Fuller, contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication."
"3609","tt0046187","4201","2","Subway rider Candy Susan Peters collides with pickpocket Skip McCoy Richard Widmark dipped in shades of Sinatra cool."
"3610","tt0046187","4201","3","She's unaware that she carries valuable microfilm; McCoy is unaware of grifting it."
"3611","tt0046187","4201","4","Both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents."
"3612","tt0046187","4201","5","Thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges."
"3613","tt0046187","4201","6","Candy is doubly watched Skip and the police and therefore doubly naive; Skip, the overconfident petty thief, is singularly unaware, trailed by federal agents; the feds, all knowing, are ultimately helpless."
"3614","tt0046187","4201","7","They can't stop the ""passing"" of government secrets or the spread of communism."
"3615","tt0046187","4202","1","Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's Cold War influenced low budget noir vehicles."
"3616","tt0046187","4202","2","With a running length of under 80 minutes, PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is tough, gritty, explosive and endlessly entertaining."
"3617","tt0046187","4202","3","Widmark stars as pickpocket Skip McCoy, who has already been picked up three times."
"3618","tt0046187","4202","4","Yet McCoy can't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster's moll Candy Jean Peters."
"3619","tt0046187","4202","5","Candy's wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the Communist movement, and it's her last job for ex boyfriend Richard Kiley to make the delivery."
"3620","tt0046187","4202","6","However, when Widmark lifts it, Peters must do whatever it takes to re claim the film she initially knows nothing about."
"3621","tt0046187","4202","7","It's a tasty set up, with Widmark's character, while not the psycho of KISS OF DEATH, a real live wire, unpredictable and tough, yet curiously charming."
"3622","tt0046187","4202","8","When Bogart or Mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get: a lone anti hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end Bogart, or an overly laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap Mitchum."
"3623","tt0046187","4202","9","With Widmark you just don't know what you are going to get, and with his incredibly modern acting style his films always hold up well he is amazing to watch."
"3624","tt0046187","4202","10","Here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film, or handing it over to the police and fighting the ""Commies"" on the right side of the law."
"3625","tt0046187","4202","11","And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet."
"3626","tt0046187","4202","12","Peters gets her best role as the moll with a heart of gold Candy."
"3627","tt0046187","4202","13","Widmark's unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with Peters; the gorgeous tramp quickly and rather unbelievably the romance angle is rather rushedfalls under Widmark's spell, yet Widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around."
"3628","tt0046187","4202","14","Peters hard edged beauty, yet lack of over lacquered Hollywood glamour Lana Turner would never have worked well in this role, is a major asset to the film."
"3629","tt0046187","4202","15","Candy is not innocent, yet she's very vulnerable, constantly being passed between and slapped around by men."
"3630","tt0046187","4202","16","Widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face, yet by the final act he's a lot more tender to her after she cops one hell of a going over from Kiley."
"3631","tt0046187","4202","17","The scene in the hospital with Peters and Widmark shouldn't work, but it does."
"3632","tt0046187","4202","18","Thelma Ritter is brilliant as stoolie Moe, well deserving of her Oscar nomination."
"3633","tt0046187","4202","19","Ritter's performance, like everything else in the film, is gritty, real and heartbreakingly honest."
"3634","tt0046187","4202","20","Her death scene is stunning."
"3635","tt0046187","4202","21","Fuller's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting."
"3636","tt0046187","4202","22","Fuller loved a good close up, and PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is full of uncomfortable, cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot."
"3637","tt0046187","4202","23","Fuller isn't afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard Old Hollywood really allowed, yet stunningly pulls away from Ritter's death scene to give the audience maximum impact."
"3638","tt0046187","4202","24","The urban locales and unusual, confronting camera angles give PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET, a bold, uncompromisingly modern look.10/10."
"3639","tt0046187","4203","1","This is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s."
"3640","tt0046187","4203","2","This minimalist and fast working director has something unusual for his earlier films a cast with some stars."
"3641","tt0046187","4203","3","Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of Communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of America and they'll stop at nothing to succeed."
"3642","tt0046187","4203","4","The film starts with Peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents."
"3643","tt0046187","4203","5","They know she is a link in a long espionage chain."
"3644","tt0046187","4203","6","Unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation a small time pickpocket Widmark is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that Peters is carrying."
"3645","tt0046187","4203","7","Widmark thinks it's just another purse he's ransacked only later does he realize the seriousness of what he's stolen."
"3646","tt0046187","4203","8","Now it's Widmark on his own with Commies and the FBI hot on his trail."
"3647","tt0046187","4203","9","Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish."
"3648","tt0046187","4203","10","Although she didn't get top billing, a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter."
"3649","tt0046187","4203","11","This supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon."
"3650","tt0046187","4203","12","Seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady."
"3651","tt0046187","4203","13","As far as the script and directing go, they are very good but with one small exception."
"3652","tt0046187","4203","14","At first, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted."
"3653","tt0046187","4203","15","It's one of the few times on film you'll see a woman punched square in the mouth!"
"3654","tt0046187","4203","16","Now THAT'S tough."
"3655","tt0046187","4203","17","Later, inexplicably, they become amazingly close too close to be believable."
"3656","tt0046187","4203","18","Still, with so much great drama and such an effective Noir like film, this can be overlooked."
"3657","tt0046187","4203","19","See this film."
"3658","tt0046187","4204","1","and anyone who watches this film will agree."
"3659","tt0046187","4204","2","This film was directed in the days when plot, character believability and theme actually mattered."
"3660","tt0046187","4204","3","Jean Peters, Widmark, and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight."
"3661","tt0046187","4204","4","Ritter is in top form as informer ""Moe"" she survives in the Bowery section of NY, acting as a stool pigeon for NYC police."
"3662","tt0046187","4204","5","The only other film in which I have seen Peters is ""Niagara"", and she certainly proves her acting ability here, complete with Brooklyn accent."
"3663","tt0046187","4204","6","Widmark is appropriately menacing, as the anti hero who must discern what the right thing is, despite his need for cash."
"3664","tt0046187","4204","7","The photography is brilliant."
"3665","tt0046187","4204","8","The neon, the subway station though it looks cleaner than the real thing!"
"3666","tt0046187","4204","9","the harbor shack where Widmark lives as a transient."
"3667","tt0046187","4204","10","Excellent use is made of the city, with ""Lightning Louie"" in Chinatown; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop."
"3668","tt0046187","4204","11","10/10."
"3669","tt0046187","4205","1","Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America's great directors."
"3670","tt0046187","4205","2","I'm not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywood's great craftsmen."
"3671","tt0046187","4205","3","But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywood's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music."
"3672","tt0046187","4205","4","During the time he worked for Hollywood studios, he knew how to take an assignment, shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts...on time and on budget."
"3673","tt0046187","4205","5","Pickup on South Street is a case in point."
"3674","tt0046187","4205","6","On the surface it's one more of Hollywood's early Fifties' anti Commie movies, complete with appeals to patriotism, a hard boiled hero and a slimy and copiously perspiring bad guy."
"3675","tt0046187","4205","7","Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut, exciting drama with any number of off kilter twists."
"3676","tt0046187","4205","8","The hero, Skip McCoy, is a three time loser, a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his stripes until the very end."
"3677","tt0046187","4205","9","The girl in the caper, Candy, has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined."
"3678","tt0046187","4205","10","One of the most appealing characters, Moe Williams, is a stoolie."
"3679","tt0046187","4205","11","And in an unusual approach to Hollywood's battle against Commies, the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isn't motivated by anything so ennobling."
"3680","tt0046187","4205","12","He just wants payback for a personal reason, and winds up becoming...at least for now...a good guy."
"3681","tt0046187","4205","13","Plus, all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio."
"3682","tt0046187","4205","14","He had to make do."
"3683","tt0046187","4205","15","Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star, but Jean Peters is a surprise."
"3684","tt0046187","4205","16","She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb, and no better than her boy friends...or her clients...want her to be."
"3685","tt0046187","4205","17","And Richard Kiley, who later would become a two time Tony award winning star on Broadway, is convincingly slippery and cowardly."
"3686","tt0046187","4205","18","It's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us, I mean introduced to us, ""The Impossible Dream"" from Man of La Mancha, More than anything else, this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash, pursued by the Feds and the Commies, moves straight ahead with great economy."
"3687","tt0046187","4205","19","The whole enterprise, with a classic noir look, only takes 80 minutes to tell."
"3688","tt0046187","4205","20","The dialogue, with Fuller as screenwriter, has that party corny, partly pungent hard boiled pulp fiction style."
"3689","tt0046187","4205","21","""That muffin you grifted...she's okay,"" one character says to Skip about Candy."
"3690","tt0046187","4205","22","Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next."
"3691","tt0046187","4205","23","Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams."
"3692","tt0046187","4205","24","All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest, part comedy relief and part sad inevitability."
"3693","tt0046187","4205","25","The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fuller's talents and strengths."
"3694","tt0046187","4205","26","In 2 minutes and 15 seconds, starting right after the credits, Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie, to establish for us what the story is about, and to show us what kind of characters Skip and Candy we're going to be involved with."
"3695","tt0046187","4205","27","And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot, packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us."
"3696","tt0046187","4205","28","Says Glenn Erickson, in my opinion one of the best of movie critics, ""In what should be an inconsequential story, Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up: stiff necked, aggressive self interest that when fully expressed recognizes what's wrong and what's right and isn't afraid to fight for it."
"3697","tt0046187","4205","29","As always in his work, the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort."""
"3698","tt0046187","4205","30","He's right, and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years."
"3699","tt0046187","4206","1","Skip McCoy is a three time loser pick pocket, unable to curb his instincts back on the street, he picks the purse of Candy on a subway train."
"3700","tt0046187","4206","2","What he doesn't realise is that Candy is carrying top secret microfilm, microfilm that is of high interest to many many organisations."
"3701","tt0046187","4206","3","Director Samuel Fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of New York City."
"3702","tt0046187","4206","4","Communist spies and shady government operatives all blend together to make Pickup On South Street a riveting viewing from first minute to the last."
"3703","tt0046187","4206","5","Based around a Dwight Taylor story called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller enthused this adaptation with heavy set political agenda, something that many at the time felt was over done, but to only focus on its anti communist leanings is doing it a big disservice."
"3704","tt0046187","4206","6","Digging a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as any that Fuller has directed, the main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece, a crook and a shallow human being, his heroics are not born out of love for his country, they are born out of his sheer stubborn streak."
"3705","tt0046187","4206","7","It's quite an achievement that Fuller has crafted one of the best anti heroes of the 50s, and i'm sure he was most grateful to the performance of Richard Widmark as McCoy, all grin and icy cold heart, his interplay with the wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent, and is the films heart."
"3706","tt0046187","4206","8","However it is the Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter who takes the acting honours, her Moe is strong and as seedy as the surrounding characters, but there is a tired warmth to her that Ritter conveys majestically."
"3707","tt0046187","4206","9","It's a B movie in texture but an A film in execution, Pickup On South Street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director."
"3708","tt0046187","4206","10","9/10"
"3709","tt0046187","4207","1","Skip McCoy Richard Widmark pick pockets Candy's Jean Peters wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the Communist cause."
"3710","tt0046187","4207","2","She is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact."
"3711","tt0046187","4207","3","However, Skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone's noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and Joey Richard Kiley and Candy who want the microfiche back."
"3712","tt0046187","4207","4","Skip can only be traced through Moe Thelma Ritter who sells information on criminals."
"3713","tt0046187","4207","5","It is made clear to Skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film, but he intends to hold out for a high price."
"3714","tt0046187","4207","6","This leads to Joey hunting after him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who has fallen in love with Skip."
"3715","tt0046187","4207","7","Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss."
"3716","tt0046187","4207","8","Its a well acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away."
"3717","tt0046187","4207","9","Its a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from Joey."
"3718","tt0046187","4207","10","Its a good film."
"3719","tt0046187","4208","1","Every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one."
"3720","tt0046187","4208","2","This also happened in the '50's with quite a few little movies, that not a lot of people have ever heard of."
"3721","tt0046187","4208","3","There are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the '50's that are worth digging out."
"3722","tt0046187","4208","4","""Panic in the Streets"" is another movie like that that springs to the mind."
"3723","tt0046187","4208","5","Both are movies that aren't really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources."
"3724","tt0046187","4208","6","I was really surprised at how much I ended up liking this movie."
"3725","tt0046187","4208","7","It was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed."
"3726","tt0046187","4208","8","Like all 'old' movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and it's characters you're in for a real treat with this movie."
"3727","tt0046187","4208","9","The movie has a really great story that involves espionage, though the movie doesn't start of like that."
"3728","tt0046187","4208","10","It begins as this typical crime thriller with a touch of film noir to it."
"3729","tt0046187","4208","11","But ""Pickup on South Street"" just isn't really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on."
"3730","tt0046187","4208","12","It ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watch."
"3731","tt0046187","4208","13","I also really liked the characters within this movie."
"3732","tt0046187","4208","14","None of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses."
"3733","tt0046187","4208","15","Really humane."
"3734","tt0046187","4208","16","It also especially features a great performance from Thelma Ritter, who even received a well deserved Oscar nomination for."
"3735","tt0046187","4208","17","It has really got to be one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen."
"3736","tt0046187","4208","18","Even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great, original, special little movie that deserves to be seen by more!"
"3737","tt0046187","4208","19","10/10"
"3738","tt0046187","4209","1","""Pickup On South Street"" is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists."
"3739","tt0046187","4209","2","The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing."
"3740","tt0046187","4209","3","The use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality."
"3741","tt0046187","4209","4","Samuel Fuller's style of directing and the cinematography by Joseph MacDonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere."
"3742","tt0046187","4209","5","Ace pickpocket and repeat offender Skip McCoy Richard Widmark gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named Candy Jean Peters on the New York subway."
"3743","tt0046187","4209","6","She was being used by her ex boyfriend Joey Richard Kiley to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her, she was carrying US Government secrets recorded on microfilm."
"3744","tt0046187","4209","7","Two FBI agents had been following Candy and witnessed the theft."
"3745","tt0046187","4209","8","One of the agents continues to tail her back to Joey's apartment and the other, Zara Willis Bouchey, visits Police Captain Dan Tiger Murvyn Vye."
"3746","tt0046187","4209","9","Zara explains that the FBI has been following Candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist group."
"3747","tt0046187","4209","10","In order to identify the pickpocket, Tiger calls in a ""stoolie"" called Moe Thelma Ritter who after being given a precise description of the ""cannon's"" method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects."
"3748","tt0046187","4209","11","Once Tiger sees Skip's name on the list he's immediately convinced that he's the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him."
"3749","tt0046187","4209","12","When Skip is brought into Tiger's office, Zara tells him about the microfilm and Tiger offers to drop any charges if he'll co operate with the investigation."
"3750","tt0046187","4209","13","Skip is flippant and arrogant."
"3751","tt0046187","4209","14","He clearly doesn't trust Tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway."
"3752","tt0046187","4209","15","Joey orders Candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it."
"3753","tt0046187","4209","16","Candy pays Moe for Skip's address and when Skip returns from being questioned by Tiger, he finds Candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money."

"3755","tt0046187","4209","18","She tells Joey about Skip's demand and Joey's boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following evening."
"3756","tt0046187","4209","19","Skip and Candy are attracted to each other and it's because of their uneasy, developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police."
"3757","tt0046187","4209","20","It soon becomes apparent, however, that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct action."
"3758","tt0046187","4209","21","The depictions of Skip, Candy and Moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compelling."
"3759","tt0046187","4209","22","Moe's work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time."
"3760","tt0046187","4209","23","She appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as ""an old clock running down"" and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in Long Island."
"3761","tt0046187","4209","24","Her belief that ""every buck has a meaning of its own"" leads her to sell any information regardless of danger, friendships or principles and yet there is one occasion where she refuses and this proves fatal."
"3762","tt0046187","4209","25","Thelma Ritter's performance certainly merited the Oscar nomination she earned for her role."
"3763","tt0046187","4209","26","Skip is a violent criminal with no concern for his victims and having already been convicted three times in the past, lives under the constant threat of being jailed for life if convicted again."
"3764","tt0046187","4209","27","Despite this, he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely, is merely philosophical when Moe betrays his whereabouts and then later, he even ensures that Moe receives the type of burial she valued so highly."
"3765","tt0046187","4209","28","Candy is an ex hooker and someone whose activities constantly put her in peril but behind her hardened exterior a warmer side gradually becomes more evident."
"3766","tt0046187","4209","29","Widmark and Peters are both perfect for their roles and like Ritter portray the different facets of their personalities with great style and conviction."
"3767","tt0046187","4210","1","I really enjoyed this film."
"3768","tt0046187","4210","2","All aspects of the film were top notch including the most important, for me anyway, the screenplay and the acting."
"3769","tt0046187","4210","3","This is definitely one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles."
"3770","tt0046187","4210","4","He is totally convincing in his performance."
"3771","tt0046187","4210","5","Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum might have tackled this role."
"3772","tt0046187","4210","6","This is my first exposure to Jean Peter's work that I can remember."
"3773","tt0046187","4210","7","She impressed so much here that I will definitely be on the lookout for her other work."
"3774","tt0046187","4210","8","Thelma Ritter, in an unglamourous role, deserved the Oscar nomination she received for playing the informant."
"3775","tt0046187","4210","9","This film works on every level."
"3776","tt0046187","4210","10","The black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning."
"3777","tt0046187","4210","11","Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance."
"3778","tt0046187","4210","12","Strongly recommended, 9/10."
"3779","tt0046187","4211","1","I watched this last night on TV HBO."
"3780","tt0046187","4211","2","I have to admit, that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other FN era movies."
"3781","tt0046187","4211","3","I loved the way Chip would be all calm one moment and then VIOLENT the very next moment."
"3782","tt0046187","4211","4","It was classic."
"3783","tt0046187","4211","5","Ahh yes."
"3784","tt0046187","4211","6","The dames, the villians, the cigars and thuggish cops!"
"3785","tt0046187","4211","7","It has it all."
"3786","tt0046187","4211","8","This movie delivered all the goods to me."
"3787","tt0046187","4211","9","I especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot, very common for this era of movie."
"3788","tt0046187","4211","10","Very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days."
"3789","tt0046187","4211","11","I rate this movie one of the best I have seen in the FN genre!"
"3790","tt0046187","4212","1","Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a tough, brutal, well made film about a pickpocket Richard Widmark who inadvertently aquires top secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents."
"3791","tt0046187","4212","2","Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex lover Richard Kiley."
"3792","tt0046187","4212","3","It's film noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress Thelma Ritter who steals the movie."
"3793","tt0046187","4212","4","As Moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties and who also sells information she is terrific in a role that brought her another Oscar nomination."
"3794","tt0046187","4212","5","Its amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award and she never won."
"3795","tt0046187","4212","6","This should have been the role that copped it for her!"
"3796","tt0046187","4213","1","Director Samuel Fuller concocts a brilliant visual set up: cocky pickpocket unwittingly lifts some microfilm from a woman's purse; it turns out she's a courier for the Communists, and now she and the grifter are being watched by the police."
"3797","tt0046187","4213","2","The Film Noir Formula is all its glory before the ingredients became clichés including waterfront locales, floozies, saxophones on the soundtrack, and one hell of a climactic fistfight."
"3798","tt0046187","4213","3","Performances by Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are right on target, and the smart, sharp script is quite colorful."
"3799","tt0046187","4213","4","Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for knockout supporting role as a ""professional stoolie""."
"3800","tt0046187","4213","5","Exciting, atmospheric, tough as nails.  from"
"3801","tt0046187","4214","1","The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies that I've seen including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten!, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and this film, Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best film noirs."
"3802","tt0046187","4214","2","It represents Fuller at his most controlled."
"3803","tt0046187","4214","3","I like him when he's out of control, of course, but nearly everything in Pickup is perfect."
"3804","tt0046187","4214","4","The film is absolutely beautiful."

"3876","tt0046187","4216","2","An example of the directing: When Candy Jean Peters starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in as if it's an alarm going off in her head."
"3877","tt0046187","4216","3","It's not cartoon like it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just ""clicks"" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag."

"3883","tt0046187","4216","9","Wonderful stuff."""
"3884","tt0046187","4216","10","Pickup On South Street"" is also one of the few movies where, even though the characters aren't perfect, you do care about them perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape: Skip as a ""three time loser"" and Candy as a youngish woman who has ""knocked around"" a lot."
"3885","tt0046187","4216","11","When these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect, it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human."

"3899","tt0061809","2719","9","This failure/fantasy matches the failure fantasy that Perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska only to find it perpetually empty."
"3900","tt0061809","2719","10","Dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants don't know that that they're going to die. we cut to the Clutters."

"3914","tt0061809","2719","24","But Dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing."
"3915","tt0061809","2719","25","Dick wants the hard cash, the $10,000 he thinks is in the Clutter's safe, which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as Perry's Mexican Treasure."

"3925","tt0061809","2719","35","Fascinating film."
"3926","tt0061809","2720","1","IN COLD BLOOD has to be ranked as first rate movie making, even if the subject matter is about as grim as it gets in the world of make believe, but film noir fans should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work, based as it is on a true life crime spree."
"3927","tt0061809","2720","2","It opens with Quincy Jones' music under the credits and starkly dramatic views of a highway bus heading toward Kansas City, effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end."

"3979","tt0061809","2724","4","Some have complained not only about the film, but about Truman Capote's source ""non fiction novel"", that the central message is unsubtle."
"3980","tt0061809","2724","5","That may be true, but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity doesn't detract from the film at all."
"3981","tt0061809","2724","6","Its refreshing, especially considering today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to see a film with a convinced political voice unafraid to force the audience to consider its viewpoint."
"3982","tt0061809","2724","7","To be honest, I'm not sure if I agree with the film's central message, but I admire its audacity nonetheless."
"3983","tt0061809","2724","8","Even if you disagree with the anti capital punishment message, there's plenty to admire about the film."
"3984","tt0061809","2724","9","The acting from the two leads is terrific."
"3985","tt0061809","2724","10","Scott Wilson still one of the most underrated actors ever is chilling as the nihilistic leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses."
"3986","tt0061809","2724","11","Robert Blake is also chilling as the more submissive of the two and the one with a conscience."
"3987","tt0061809","2724","12","His character obviously has a voice of reason, but is terrified to go against Wilson theres a good amount of homoerotic subtext on his character's part."
"3988","tt0061809","2724","13","The cinematography is terrific, sleek yet gritty and really giving the impression the viewer is watching a documentary."
"3989","tt0061809","2724","14","Add another classic score from Quincey Jones, and you have a masterpiece."
"3990","tt0061809","2724","15","9/10"
"3991","tt0061809","2725","1","""In Cold Blood"", adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals."
"3992","tt0061809","2725","2","The film excels as a character study of the killers, particularly trigger man Perry Smith Robert Blake."
"3993","tt0061809","2725","3","The cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease."
"3994","tt0061809","2725","4","Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities."
"3995","tt0061809","2725","5","They play off of each other effortlessly while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies."
"3996","tt0061809","2725","6","The rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on."
"3997","tt0061809","2725","7","Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction."
"3998","tt0061809","2725","8","In my opinion, both were excellent, though the script does miscalculate with some ill advised narration in the late stages."
"3999","tt0061809","2725","9","The Oscar nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top notch, as is the editing."
"4000","tt0061809","2725","10","Also worthy of note is the jazzy score by Quincy Jones which secured the last of the film's four Oscar nominations."
"4001","tt0061809","2725","11","Unlike so many other crime films, this one doesn't glamorize violence."
"4002","tt0061809","2725","12","Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them."
"4003","tt0061809","2725","13","Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach."
"4004","tt0061809","2725","14","I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled."
"4005","tt0061809","2726","1","This movie is up there with the all time classics."
"4006","tt0061809","2726","2","The music, camera shots, and acting are excellent."
"4007","tt0061809","2726","3","Showing the movie in black and white gave it a much better appearance and complemented the music perfectly, like Psycho."
"4008","tt0061809","2726","4","Its surprising how so few people have commented on this movie."
"4009","tt0061809","2726","5","My guess is that its a hard movie to find."
"4010","tt0061809","2726","6","I gave the film a 9."
"4011","tt0061809","2726","7","See the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about."
"4012","tt0061809","2727","1","One of the best true crime movies ever made and very faithful to Truman Capote's book which invented the true crime novel genre."
"4013","tt0061809","2727","2","Haunting Quincy Jones musical score and terrific acting by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, the killers."
"4014","tt0061809","2727","3","Why Wilson didn't go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me."
"4015","tt0061809","2727","4","The black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch."
"4016","tt0061809","2727","5","The re creation of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination, even more scary than if they had shown the shotgun going off."
"4017","tt0061809","2727","6","The movie was filmed in the actual Clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders."
"4018","tt0061809","2727","7","The movie has a very documentary feel besides the scenes at the actual Clutter home other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores the killers actually went to."
"4019","tt0061809","2727","8","Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie."
"4020","tt0061809","2727","9","Will Geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real Clutter murder jurors portraying themselves as the jury for the movie."
"4021","tt0061809","2727","10","This is a solid movie, scary every time you see it."
"4022","tt0061809","2728","1","Simply one of the best ever!"
"4023","tt0061809","2728","2","Richard Brooks' adaptation of Truman Capote's non fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement."
"4024","tt0061809","2728","3","Stunning black and white cinematography that should have won an Oscar, a haunting Quincy Jones score and tremendous performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the oddly matched killers."
"4025","tt0061809","2728","4","This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and wasn't even nominated for Best Picture while Dr."
"4026","tt0061809","2728","5","Doolittle was."
"4027","tt0061809","2728","6","Go Figure!"
"4028","tt0061809","2728","7","Although you don't get to know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain staking process of tracking these guys down."
"4029","tt0061809","2728","8","John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey."
"4030","tt0061809","2728","9","There are simply no flaws in this one. 10 out of 10."
"4031","tt0061809","2728","10","Best performance = Scott Wilson with R."
"4032","tt0061809","2728","11","Blake a close second."
"4033","tt0061809","2728","12","Highly recommended!"
"4034","tt0061809","2729","1","I voted excellent for how well the acting was, not for the content."
"4035","tt0061809","2729","2","It still gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie."
"4036","tt0061809","2729","3","Two ex cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison."
"4037","tt0061809","2729","4","During the ride, the tension begins to mount, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation."
"4038","tt0061809","2729","5","After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend."
"4039","tt0061809","2729","6","The blood curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really made my blood run cold and gave me chills."
"4040","tt0061809","2729","7","That the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family."
"4041","tt0061809","2729","8","Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith."
"4042","tt0061809","2729","9","The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote."
"4043","tt0061809","2730","1","I saw this in the theater during it's initial release and it was disturbing then as I'm sure it would still be."
"4044","tt0061809","2730","2","It was the first part of '68 and this was still making the rounds in towns across America and there had recently been a mass murder in my hometown where I saw this where a man went on a shooting rampage."
"4045","tt0061809","2730","3","The freshness of that close to home event combined with this dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience."
"4046","tt0061809","2730","4","It really brought to life the excellent acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson."
"4047","tt0061809","2730","5","I was familiar with the novel based on the true event by Truman Capote and the screenplay and direction by Richard Brooks wove the event and Truman's interpretation into compelling gritty cinematic adaptation."
"4048","tt0061809","2730","6","Music from Quincy Jones effectively scores it's story."
"4049","tt0061809","2730","7","I've only seen this a couple times since."
"4050","tt0061809","2730","8","It was too real."
"4051","tt0061809","2730","9","Almost like being a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers."
"4052","tt0061809","2730","10","I would give this a 9.0 of a possible 10."
"4053","tt0061809","2730","11","Society is so desensitized to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and could be viewed with less effect but to anyone over 50 this will be a hallmark into the examination of the criminal psyche."
"4054","tt0061809","2731","1","Sorry, I don't have much time to write."
"4055","tt0061809","2731","2","I am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years."
"4056","tt0061809","2731","3","She said that Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath no conscience extraordinarily well."
"4057","tt0061809","2731","4","I agree!"
"4058","tt0061809","2731","5","She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself superbly."
"4059","tt0061809","2731","6","I agree!"
"4060","tt0061809","2731","7","What a chilling and tremendous film."
"4061","tt0061809","2731","8","I have seen over 2000 films and would rank this in the top 100."
"4062","tt0061809","2731","9","My lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly."
"4063","tt0061809","2731","10","My only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film."
"4064","tt0061809","2731","11","Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these 2 losers did."
"4065","tt0061809","2732","1","Herbet Clutter, wife Bonnie, and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of Holcomb, Kansas but in the early hours of 14 November 1959 all four were brutally murdered."
"4066","tt0061809","2732","2","Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion."
"4067","tt0061809","2732","3","The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD."
"4068","tt0061809","2732","4","Controversial, shocking, and exceptionally well written, it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day."
"4069","tt0061809","2732","5","The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself."
"4070","tt0061809","2732","6","Filmed in black and white in many of the real life locations, it has a slightly documentary quality, icy and detached and the overall cast is exceptional."
"4071","tt0061809","2732","7","This is the film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly so."
"4072","tt0061809","2732","8","As killer Perry Smith, Blake traps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy; it is a masterful performance from start to finish."
"4073","tt0061809","2732","9","As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less fine."
"4074","tt0061809","2732","10","Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and brings them to the Clutter home only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction."
"4075","tt0061809","2732","11","The centerpiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the Clutter home; actually filmed in the Clutter house itself, it is a spinechilling sequence, horrific and deeply disturbing."
"4076","tt0061809","2732","12","Director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy."
"4077","tt0061809","2732","13","Given the overall power of the film, however, this becomes a trivial annoyance."
"4078","tt0061809","2732","14","Strong stuff and recommended."
"4079","tt0061809","2732","15","GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"4080","tt0061809","2733","1","The premise to this movie was one which focused on the polarization of of ideologies in the United States.."
"4081","tt0061809","2733","2","This was a highly combustible scenario in America whereby two entirely different cultures collided."
"4082","tt0061809","2733","3","What justified such heinously depraved actions anyway..."
"4083","tt0061809","2733","4","As this film presents the scene,while Hickock and Smith drank these two men were not intoxicated, nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs!!"
"4084","tt0061809","2733","5","It was a clear cut case of cold and calculated deliberation.."
"4085","tt0061809","2733","6","Basically, these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social neglect..."
"4086","tt0061809","2733","7","Anytime past 1975, we as a nation have nurtured an empathy for deviates who have been victimized by their environment..."
"4087","tt0061809","2733","8","However, this incident takes place in 1959!!"
"4088","tt0061809","2733","9","This dreadful revelation sideswiped us, and mired the nation into a tailspin of conflicting ethics!!"
"4089","tt0061809","2733","10","With the recent release of the movie ""Capote"" based on Truman Capote, who was the creator of the documentary ""In Cold Blood"", the American people have cultivated a new found fascination with this film!!"
"4090","tt0061809","2733","11","Robert Blake played the role of Perry Smith, one of the villains in this movie..."
"4091","tt0061809","2733","12","This is seemingly appropriate given the notoriety he has been involved with concerning his personal life!!"
"4092","tt0061809","2733","13","""In Cold Blood"" centers on the element of the unexplained..."
"4093","tt0061809","2733","14","There was no vengeance involved, there was no material gain to be acquired, there was no potential for social advancement here either, this is merely an instance of a latent and insidiously belligerent anger which ends certainly did not justify the means!!"
"4094","tt0061809","2733","15","The situational diatribes which Hickock and Smith lamented about were always ambiguous!!"
"4095","tt0061809","2733","16","Under the circumstances, why then should they take their frustrations out on an anonymously unsuspecting and innocent Kansas family..."
"4096","tt0061809","2733","17","Will Geer Grandpa Walton plays the prosecuting attorney who is sickened by this act of macabre capriciousness!!"
"4097","tt0061809","2733","18","His argument is thoroughly convincing..."
"4098","tt0061809","2733","19","His contention being: ""These two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours"" This is a line of logic which would induce me to render a verdict of a conviction if I were to be one of the members of the jury!!"
"4099","tt0061809","2733","20","Absolute disdain for your precarious plight in life does not serve as vindication for orchestrating a capital crime!!"
"4100","tt0061809","2733","21","It was Capote's instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the American public's attention!!"
"4101","tt0061809","2733","22","As it turn out, it was a harbinger of things to come.."
"4102","tt0061809","2733","23","""In Cold Blood"" did just that!!"
"4103","tt0061809","2733","24","This incident was the calm before the storm relating to a pertinent aspect of emergence to the radical 1960's!!"
"4104","tt0061809","2733","25","Such a lethal charade also served as an insight to the isolated interests which would besiege many typical Americans for the future!!!"
"4105","tt0061809","2733","26","Truman Capote does a tremendous job on authenticating this savage occurrence with his book, which was a best seller and, with this documentary as well..."
"4106","tt0061809","2733","27","The acting in this film by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as well as people like John Forsythe, was incredible!!"
"4107","tt0061809","2733","28","The director, Richard Brooks, ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""Blackboard Jungle"" ""Elmer Gantry"" and ""Key Largo"" to name but a few!!"
"4108","tt0061809","2733","29","was outstanding in his collaborative efforts in this movie!!"
"4109","tt0061809","2733","30","I think that ""In Cold Blood"" is one of the best films in the history of movies!!"
"4110","tt0061809","2733","31","The film depicts two reprehensible spawns of depravity who delved into demented theatrics, and wound up captivating a trite gratification for being acknowledged at a pejorative nationwide level!!...."
"4111","tt0061809","2733","32","This movie pinpoints a psychological discontentment which spurs on an emerging bevy of counter culture purveyors of violence!!"
"4112","tt0061809","2733","33","Our nation's ideologies are incredibly different now, than they were in 1959!!"
"4113","tt0061809","2733","34","This movie introduces the American people to the emotional and vacillating culprits who initiated such a precarious metamorphosis in our overall value system!!"
"4114","tt0061809","2733","35","I recommend to everyone that they see this movie..."""
"4115","tt0061809","2733","36","In Cold Blood"" was the focal point to the film ""Capote""!"
"4116","tt0061809","2733","37","Think about it, making a movie about a movie constitutes a rare and coveted accolade in Hollywood!!"
"4117","tt0061809","2733","38","In the case of ""In Cold Blood"" it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant, intellectually elevating, and, of course, it goes without saying, ""In Cold Blood"" was utterly spellbinding, as well as a totally remarkable movie!!"
"4118","tt0061809","2734","1","Easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century."
"4119","tt0061809","2734","2","In Cold Blood is brilliant in the simplicity and realism of its storytelling, and absolutely riveting."
"4120","tt0061809","2734","3","Robert Blake walks away with the film."
"4121","tt0061809","2734","4","The story seems to be presented almost entirely from Perry's viewpoint, despite Dick being the leader and planner of the pair."
"4122","tt0061809","2734","5","The viewer will invariable perceive Dick as being more unstable, immature, and generally feel like Perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but for Dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score."
"4123","tt0061809","2734","6","Based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy, In Cold Blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural Kansas family one cold, windy night, because Dick has bought into an age old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in their home."
"4124","tt0061809","2734","7","As ""prosecutor"" a character that isn't given a name in the script, played by Will Geer, so astutely points out, their lives are bought for only $10 a head."
"4125","tt0061809","2734","8","Director Richard Brooks wisely chooses not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until the end of the film, prior to this we only know it has happened and watch the lives of Dick and Perry slowly unravel as they attempt to escape not only being apprehended by law enforcement, but also Perry's own ever escalating sense of impending doom."
"4126","tt0061809","2734","9","He repeatedly makes remarks, ""No one ever gets away with a thing like that,"" and ""I can't help thinking we left something behind that belongs to us."""
"4127","tt0061809","2734","10","Dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime, only irritation at Perry's."
"4128","tt0061809","2734","11","Indeed, after they are caught, it is Dick who breaks first, and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime."
"4129","tt0061809","2734","12","I felt somewhat sorry for Perry from the very beginning of the film, and more so as events progressed, but I only loathed Dick."
"4130","tt0061809","2734","13","The genius of the film is the engaging manner in which the story is played."
"4131","tt0061809","2734","14","We do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters, but that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred."
"4132","tt0061809","2734","15","The story is unrelenting, taunt, the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few minutes."
"4133","tt0061809","2734","16","For those of you who are interested in such things, I noticed a couple of the ""Goofs"" listed here on the IMDb page for In Cold Blood are incorrect or exaggerated."
"4134","tt0061809","2734","17","Such as the ""reversed"" process shot, at the beginning of the film, as Dick and Perry are driving across the bridge into Kansas."
"4135","tt0061809","2734","18","To begin with, this isn't even a process shot, the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield of the car is real."
"4136","tt0061809","2734","19","A large cargo truck located to the left front of Dick's Pontiac creates the optical illusion that they are going backward because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed, but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle."
"4137","tt0061809","2734","20","As I previously stated, this is one of the ten best works of 20th century cinema, not recommended for the very young due to some course language and implied and inferred violence no actual in your face gore as a modern film would resort to, but a thoroughly excellent film."
"4138","tt0061809","2735","1","The actual crime story at the core of In Cold Blood might seem a little 'tame' for those who are weened on the classic serial killer stories Gein, Bundy, Dahmer, or just the more notorious cases out in Hollywood OJ, Manson."
"4139","tt0061809","2735","2","The essential facts in the case don't amount to anything terribly convoluted: Perry Smith and Dick Hickock here played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson respectively met by some luck, conspired to rob a man's farmhouse safe out in Kansas, and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and dagger came away with 43 dollars."
"4140","tt0061809","2735","3","Aside from their returning to the US after fleeing briefly to Mexico, there isn't a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either."
"4141","tt0061809","2735","4","They were caught by some stroke of ironic chance a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after Smith and Hickcock helped out a boy and his old man collecting bottles for change, and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead."
"4142","tt0061809","2735","5","The story ended in 1965."
"4143","tt0061809","2735","6","But it's the handling of the story, moments of moot, the performances, a pure cinematic touch that Brooks and his absolutely marvelous the late/great DP Conrad Hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white, and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama save perhaps for near the end, which is pitch perfect."
"4144","tt0061809","2735","7","The air of tragedy hangs over the story, and not so much because of the killings themselves, no matter how brutal they are as the ""third"" man that is conjured up, as the narrator observes, by Smith and Hickcock teaming up, but because of the inevitability of the story."
"4145","tt0061809","2735","8","You feel somehow for these criminals, who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a B movie."
"4146","tt0061809","2735","9","These aren't good people, but they aren't necessarily monsters either, at least all the way through."
"4147","tt0061809","2735","10","It's also an excellent 'road movie' as we see Smith and Hickcock on the road down to the Clutter residence the actual night time scene of the crime taking place late in the film, then on to Mexico, then back to America towards Las Vegas."
"4148","tt0061809","2735","11","We get to soak in the personalities of these two, probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an inmate."
"4149","tt0061809","2735","12","It's actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two sort of akin to the aimless quality of Malick's Badlands characters, and it's also a sign of daring for the period."
"4150","tt0061809","2735","13","There's no sermonizing, like ""he did this because of that and this or the other."""
"4151","tt0061809","2735","14","We see how Smith had an abusive, psychotic father, but that Smith loved and hated him."
"4152","tt0061809","2735","15","The complexity there is too much for the movie, maybe even too much for Capote's book which, I should confess, I've still yet to read, though I plan to."
"4153","tt0061809","2735","16","And we see Hickcock is this creature of slick confidence i.e. getting the suit and other things with bad checks, but without any deep rooted explanation to it all."
"4154","tt0061809","2735","17","The streak of fatalism in In Cold Blood is some of the starkest of the 60s, and it's the luck of Brooks to have its stars as Blake in his top of the pops performance this and Lost Highway, oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years, his quintessential pieces of work, and Wilson's breakthrough before becoming a character actor."
"4155","tt0061809","2735","18","While they're surrounded by fine supporting work, they themselves are eerily absorbing, driven more or less by greed and fantasies of escapism with treasure, and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends."
"4156","tt0061809","2735","19","Is this a morale of the story, if there could be one, that it's more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill can't be classified, of good vs evil getting smudged."
"4157","tt0061809","2735","20","Smith apologized for his crime before being hung, and he points out, ""but to who."""
"4158","tt0061809","2735","21","This is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of true crime the bonafide chills, and it's quite possibly the best American film of 1967."
"4159","tt0061809","2736","1","A unique film...one of the best of all time."
"4160","tt0061809","2736","2","Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing, etc. just fantastic."
"4161","tt0061809","2736","3","As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas farm family the Clutters by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery."
"4162","tt0061809","2736","4","I've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film."
"4163","tt0061809","2736","5","The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them."
"4164","tt0061809","2736","6","Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing."
"4165","tt0061809","2736","7","Cocky, twitchy, and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming, oily and plausible."
"4166","tt0061809","2736","8","Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well lonely, and at once empathetic and cold blooded."
"4167","tt0061809","2736","9","Who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it."
"4168","tt0061809","2736","10","He does, and it's brilliant!"
"4169","tt0061809","2736","11","A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully."
"4170","tt0061809","2736","12","Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high water marks, and that stands for acting period."
"4171","tt0061809","2736","13","The cops are wonderful too."
"4172","tt0061809","2736","14","Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well."
"4173","tt0061809","2736","15","Unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles, these are just genuine flatfeet, working the case with determination and competence."
"4174","tt0061809","2736","16","They seem so real."
"4175","tt0061809","2736","17","I've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen most of the crime classics going way back."
"4176","tt0061809","2736","18","Really one of a kind in this respect."
"4177","tt0061809","2736","19","PARTIAL SPOILER COMING this movie's unique in that you already know what's happened, but I'm warning for the record."
"4178","tt0061809","2736","20","Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks, Mano a Mano."
"4179","tt0061809","2736","21","This movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film."
"4180","tt0061809","2736","22","Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel, unaware the cops have the goods on them."
"4181","tt0061809","2736","23","But the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions."
"4182","tt0061809","2736","24","This is some of the best acting you'll ever see."
"4183","tt0061809","2736","25","Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating."
"4184","tt0061809","2736","26","To help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story, ICB was filmed at the actual Clutter house, and I've heard the Clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel."
"4185","tt0061809","2736","27","It works."
"4186","tt0061809","2736","28","These seem like decent, simple folk."
"4187","tt0061809","2736","29","It makes the crime so palpable and sad."
"4188","tt0061809","2736","30","I'll stop here."
"4189","tt0061809","2736","31","It's not a feel good movie, but it is one of the best movies ever made, and so unique, it's mandatory viewing for every film buff."
"4190","tt0061809","2737","1","The movie was gripping from start to finish and its b/w photography of the American heartland is stunning."
"4191","tt0061809","2737","2","We feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into Mexico and back to America again."
"4192","tt0061809","2737","3","Near the end of the movie, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face."
"4193","tt0061809","2737","4","In the end, we follow them up the stairway to their final moment."
"4194","tt0061809","2737","5","The two criminals, performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could be seen on any street in any town."
"4195","tt0061809","2737","6","Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town."
"4196","tt0061809","2737","7","This point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else."
"4197","tt0061809","2737","8","Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition."
"4198","tt0061809","2737","9","These two delusional men kill an entire family, looking for a safe that isn't there."
"4199","tt0061809","2737","10","Once on the run, they start writing bad cheques, carving out a trail for the authorities."
"4200","tt0061809","2737","11","There are many fine supporting actors."
"4201","tt0061809","2737","12","I like John Forsyth as the detective on the case, Alvin Dewey."
"4202","tt0061809","2737","13","Also, Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney."
"4203","tt0061809","2737","14","I have often wanted to see this movie all the way through, having only caught it in short snatches; I did finally get to it after buying the DVD."
"4204","tt0061809","2737","15","The result is the finest classic crime movie I have ever seen."
"4205","tt0061809","2737","16","Don't miss this brilliant movie."
"4206","tt0061809","2737","17","To me, this is what great film making is all about."
"4207","tt0061809","2738","1","I haven't seen this in over 20yrs but I still remember things about it."
"4208","tt0061809","2738","2","This film could NOT have been made in color."
"4209","tt0061809","2738","3","The stark grays are what make it, and was life really that simple in the 1950's.."
"4210","tt0061809","2738","4","What stands out the most in my memory is Perry Smith going to the gallows."
"4211","tt0061809","2738","5","His breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap."
"4212","tt0061809","2738","6","I don't think I could watch that again.....once is plenty."
"4213","tt0061809","2738","7","It's like that unnamed guy at the beginning of ""Papillon"" who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine."
"4214","tt0061809","2738","8","The guy that said watch this on a double bill with ""Dead Man Walking"" should have added the last 10 minutes of ""I Want To Live"" as well."
"4215","tt0061809","2738","9","Some of my ancestors being ""aristos"" went to the guillotine in 1794 95 so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense."
"4216","tt0061809","2739","1","Criminals Perry Smith and Richard ""Dick"" Hickock believe Mr."
"4217","tt0061809","2739","2","Clutter of Holcomb, Kansas keeps a large supply of cash on hand in a safe."
"4218","tt0061809","2739","3","On November 15, 1959 at two a.m. they end up murdering Mr. and Mrs."
"4219","tt0061809","2739","4","Clutter and their teenage son and daughter."
"4220","tt0061809","2739","5","After a little police investigation the two men are found and sentenced to be hanged."
"4221","tt0061809","2739","6","In Cold Blood 1967 is directed by Richard Brooks."
"4222","tt0061809","2739","7","Now, I haven't read the Truman Capote novel this movie is based on, so I can't make any comparisons."
"4223","tt0061809","2739","8","The movie does a brilliant job telling of those horrific events that actually took place."
"4224","tt0061809","2739","9","Robert Blake is excellent as Perry."
"4225","tt0061809","2739","10","Of course, Blake had the murder case of his own a few years back, being accused of murdering his wife."
"4226","tt0061809","2739","11","He's free now, but we still don't know the truth."
"4227","tt0061809","2739","12","What ever that may be, he's still a very fine actor."
"4228","tt0061809","2739","13","Scott Wilson does remarkable job as Hickock."
"4229","tt0061809","2739","14","John Forsythe is terrific as Alvin Dewey."
"4230","tt0061809","2739","15","Paul Stewart is very good as Jensen."
"4231","tt0061809","2739","16","Jeff Corey is marvelous as Mr."
"4232","tt0061809","2739","17","Hickock."
"4233","tt0061809","2739","18","Same thing with Charles McGraw who plays Tex Smith."
"4234","tt0061809","2739","19","John McLiam portrays Herbert Clutter, Ruth Storey is his wife Bonnie, Brenda Currin is the daughter Nancy and Paul Hough is the son Kenyon."
"4235","tt0061809","2739","20","Great job by each of them."
"4236","tt0061809","2739","21","There is much to remember from this film."
"4237","tt0061809","2739","22","Let's start from the lighter side."
"4238","tt0061809","2739","23","It's pretty great when Perry wants to go hunting for gold in Mexico and says to Hickock: Remember Bogart in Treasure of the Sierra Madre."""
"4239","tt0061809","2739","24","And Blake himself was in that movie as a boy!"
"4240","tt0061809","2739","25","And it's a fun moment when they, giving a ride to that boy and his granddad, collect bottles and turn them in for refund money."
"4241","tt0061809","2739","26","Those darker moments are the most haunting ones."
"4242","tt0061809","2739","27","The flashback sequence, where you see the murders happening, is extremely terrifying."
"4243","tt0061809","2739","28","When Perry goes to kill the girl, Nancy last, and she says ""Oh, please, don't""..."
"4244","tt0061809","2739","29","The brutality of man, it's impossible to explain."
"4245","tt0061809","2739","30","Then the hanging scene."
"4246","tt0061809","2739","31","First there goes Hickock and then Perry, first talking to the minister."
"4247","tt0061809","2739","32","In the last image of the movie we see Perry hitting the end of the rope."
"4248","tt0061809","2739","33","Sure movies,and books may try to sympathize these villains."
"4249","tt0061809","2739","34","Especially Perry's character is someone you could feel sorry for."
"4250","tt0061809","2739","35","He thinks of his mom, and dad who he hates, but still loves."
"4251","tt0061809","2739","36","But it doesn't change the fact both of these men these actors portray are brutal murderers, who don't feel sorry for anybody."
"4252","tt0061809","2739","37","They go to this house and murder an entire family, in cold blood."
"4253","tt0061809","2739","38","How could you sympathize these people."
"4254","tt0061809","2740","1","Tremendous black and white nighttime cinematography, and plenty of it, highlights this supposedly true life account of a 1950s murder in Kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two men."
"4255","tt0061809","2740","2","The story was written by Truman Capote, so you get the very Liberal anti death penalty message at the end of the film, which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case."
"4256","tt0061809","2740","3","Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family."
"4257","tt0061809","2740","4","Despite the annoying slant at the end, this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating."
"4258","tt0061809","2740","5","Famed photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this."
"4259","tt0061809","2740","6","It makes me wish more modern day films were made in black and white."
"4260","tt0061809","2740","7","See it on DVD.Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here."
"4261","tt0061809","2740","8","My third viewing of this film came in early April of 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife."
"4262","tt0061809","2740","9","One can't help but look at Blake and this film differently after that."
"4263","tt0061809","2741","1","As I have matured, my fascination with the Academy Awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement."
"4264","tt0061809","2741","2","As in a few other comments that I have written, the bizarre results of Academy Award voting are often difficult to explain."
"4265","tt0061809","2741","3","The omission of ""In Cold Blood"" in 1967 as one of the five Best Picture nominees is one of those inexplicable instances, especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable ""Dr."
"4266","tt0061809","2741","4","Dolittle."""
"4267","tt0061809","2741","5","While only an insomniac or masochist would tune in to that Rex Harrison disaster, Richard Brook's powerful adaptation of Truman Capotes non fiction novel retains its ability to capture the viewer's attention and leave him or her completely drained by the final fade out."
"4268","tt0061809","2741","6","While there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen, the film is definitely adult material."
"4269","tt0061809","2741","7","Based on a Nebraska multiple murder in the 1950's and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place, ""In Cold Blood"" was filmed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall in stark black and white, and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio."
"4270","tt0061809","2741","8","Together with Quincy Jones's unsettling score, Hall's work should have been credited above the title with Brook's screenplay as the three pillars on which this intense classic is built."
"4271","tt0061809","2741","9","The performances are fine as well."
"4272","tt0061809","2741","10","Scott Wilson is all cold charm and Robert Blake intense introversion as the two killers."
"4273","tt0061809","2741","11","There is an inside joke at one point when Blake speaks of Bogart and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" while the duo are driving to Mexico."
"4274","tt0061809","2741","12","As a child star, Blake sold the lottery ticket to Bogart in that John Huston film."
"4275","tt0061809","2741","13","The film, like the book, is definitely slanted towards the killers and has an anti capital punishment tilt, although the remorselessness of the murderers somewhat negates that sentiment despite the difficult to watch final scenes."
"4276","tt0061809","2741","14","Some have criticized the film because it does focus on the criminals, their backgrounds, and lives, while the Clutter family, which was literally murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night, come across as one dimensional characters of little import."
"4277","tt0061809","2741","15","This lack of balance comes from the book as Capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row."
"4278","tt0061809","2741","16","The Clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth."
"4279","tt0061809","2741","17","However, whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment, ""In Cold Blood"" will leave you mired deep in conflicting thoughts."
"4280","tt0061809","2741","18","Run a double bill with ""Dead Man Walking,"" and you may not speak for days."
"4281","tt0061809","2742","1","Richard Brooks excellent 1967 film of Truman Capote's novel IN COLD BLOOD is a perfect companion piece to Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar winning performance in the 2005 CAPOTE."
"4282","tt0061809","2742","2","They really play well together try them on separate nights."
"4283","tt0061809","2742","3","It is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well."
"4284","tt0061809","2742","4","These two truly enhance each other."
"4285","tt0061809","2742","5","Even though different actors play the roles of killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces blend well."
"4286","tt0061809","2742","6","Only the part of the writer played by Paul Stewart in the Brooks films is weaker, as they give him a different name then Capote."
"4287","tt0061809","2742","7","I'd suggest watching CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD."
"4288","tt0061809","2742","8","It makes for a powerful experience!"
"4289","tt0061809","2743","1","In the year 2006, ""In Cold Blood"" a riveting thriller from 1967 has two new interesting contexts that it did not previous have."
"4290","tt0061809","2743","2","First, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, Robert Blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife."
"4291","tt0061809","2743","3","Second, the recent Oscar winning biopic, ""Capote"" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author, Truman Capote."
"4292","tt0061809","2743","4","These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience."
"4293","tt0061809","2743","5","As a stand alone film from it's era, ""In Cold Blood"" is top notch in every way."
"4294","tt0061809","2743","6","Most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall later of ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"" fame."
"4295","tt0061809","2743","7","Many of the stills from this film of the Kansas farm house at night or the tree lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography."
"4296","tt0061809","2743","8","Combined with the cracker jack direction from Brooks and superb editing in the early scenes where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers, a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events."
"4297","tt0061809","2743","9","It's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screen."
"4298","tt0061809","2743","10","The film is also anchored nicely by Robert Blake's eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo."
"4299","tt0061809","2743","11","The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done."
"4300","tt0061809","2743","12","Then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last ""confession"" so to speak."
"4301","tt0061809","2743","13","It's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting, superb writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography."
"4302","tt0061809","2743","14","I dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down Robert Blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears."
"4303","tt0061809","2743","15","The only thing hampering ""In Cold Blood"" is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end."
"4304","tt0061809","2743","16","The tacked on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey."
"4305","tt0061809","2744","1","Remarkable, disturbing film about the true life, senseless, brutal murder of a small town family, along with the aftermath, and examination of the lives of the killers, Dick Hickok and Perry Smith."
"4306","tt0061809","2744","2","No matter how much time goes by, or how dated this film may look, it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this."
"4307","tt0061809","2744","3","This really traces multiple tragedies: The tragedy, brutality and senselessness of the murder of the Clutter family, a decent farm family in small town Holcomb, Kansas; and the wasted, brutal and sad lives of Hickok and Smith."
"4308","tt0061809","2744","4","An interesting point is made in the film: that neither of these two immature, scared, petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone."
"4309","tt0061809","2744","5","But, together, they created a dangerous, murderous collective personality; one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them."
"4310","tt0061809","2744","6","They push each other along a road of ""proving"" something to each other."
"4311","tt0061809","2744","7","That they were man enough to do it, to carry it out; neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big ""score""; an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led."
"4312","tt0061809","2744","8","These were two grown up children, who live in a criminal's world of not backing down from dares; who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness. in this instance, these needs carried right through to the murder of the Clutters."
"4313","tt0061809","2744","9","The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the Clutter family, but the point is made."
"4314","tt0061809","2744","10","These were respected, law abiding, small town people, who didn't deserve this terrifying fate."
"4315","tt0061809","2744","11","The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith."
"4316","tt0061809","2744","12","Perry Smith, whose early life was filled with security and love, but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path."
"4317","tt0061809","2744","13","Hickok, poor and left pretty much to his own devices, not able to see how he fit in, using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with."
"4318","tt0061809","2744","14","An interesting, and maybe the first, look at capital punishment, and what ends we hope to achieve."
"4319","tt0061809","2744","15","Is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us, or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these."
"4320","tt0061809","2744","16","Is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit, operating under the radar, believing they fool everyone they come into contact with."
"4321","tt0061809","2744","17","To be deterred, you must believe it's possible you will be caught."
"4322","tt0061809","2744","18","Is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught.; who have committed hundreds of petty crimes, and got away with them."
"4323","tt0061809","2744","19","This was supposed to be a ""cinch"", ""no witnesses""."
"4324","tt0061809","2744","20","When caught, Hickok finds he can't charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks."
"4325","tt0061809","2744","21","Smith, who believes he deserves such a fate anyway, who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done, willingly tells the story when he learns that Hickok has cowardly caved in."
"4326","tt0061809","2744","22","Hickok blinked first."
"4327","tt0061809","2744","23","A silly game of chicken between two immature, emotionally damaged, dangerous men."
"4328","tt0061809","2744","24","Fascinating psychological thriller, telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation's history."
"4329","tt0061809","2744","25","Stunning portrayals by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson."
"4330","tt0061809","2744","26","These roles made their careers."
"4331","tt0061809","2745","1","I've seen a great many films, but 'In Cold Blood' stands alone in a class by itself."
"4332","tt0061809","2745","2","It excels in every department."
"4333","tt0061809","2745","3","The fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story, rather than the name on the marquee."
"4334","tt0061809","2745","4","Blake and Wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo."
"4335","tt0061809","2745","5","The fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place, even inside the very house, add additional chills."
"4336","tt0061809","2745","6","The black/white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent."
"4337","tt0061809","2745","7","There are many outstanding cinematic works out there, but if I could only vote for one to top the list, it would most probably be ""In Cold Blood""."
"4338","tt0061809","2746","1","Imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night, and then going to bed."
"4339","tt0061809","2746","2","There's no need to lock the doors."
"4340","tt0061809","2746","3","The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees."
"4341","tt0061809","2746","4","Sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway."
"4342","tt0061809","2746","5","Moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room."
"4343","tt0061809","2746","6","What makes this image so scary is the setting: a remote farmhouse ... at night."
"4344","tt0061809","2746","7","Based on Truman Capote's best selling book, and with B&W lighting comparable to the best 1940's noir films, ""In Cold Blood"" presents a terrifying story, especially in that first Act, as the plot takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads."
"4345","tt0061809","2746","8","It's the stuff of nightmares."
"4346","tt0061809","2746","9","But this is no dream."

"4349","tt0061809","2746","12","Director Richard Brooks used the actual locations where the real life events occurred, even the farmhouse ... and its interior!"
"4350","tt0061809","2746","13","It makes for a memorable, and haunting, film."
"4351","tt0061809","2746","14","Both of the lead actors closely resemble the two real life killers."
"4352","tt0061809","2746","15","Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith, short and stocky with a bum leg, who dreams of finding Cortez' buried treasure."
"4353","tt0061809","2746","16","Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the smooth talking con artist with an all American smile."
"4354","tt0061809","2746","17","After their killing spree, the duo head to Mexico."
"4355","tt0061809","2746","18","Things go awry there, so they come back to the U.S., stealing cars, hitchhiking, and generally being miserable as they roam from place to place."
"4356","tt0061809","2746","19","But it's a fool's life, and the two outlaws soon regret their actions."
"4357","tt0061809","2746","20","The film's final twenty minutes are mesmerizing, as the rain falls, the rope tightens, and all we hear is the pounding of a beating heart."
"4358","tt0061809","2746","21","Even with its somewhat mundane middle Act, ""In Cold Blood"" stages in riveting detail a real life story that still hypnotizes, nearly half a century later."
"4359","tt0061809","2746","22","It's that setting that does it."
"4360","tt0061809","2746","23","Do you suppose people in rural Kansas still leave their doors unlocked ... at night."
"4361","tt0061809","2747","1","Although it was released way back in 1967, IN COLD BLOOD still remains the benchmark by which all true crime films are matched."
"4362","tt0061809","2747","2","Veteran writer/director Richard Brooks ELMER GANTRY adapted Truman Capote's non fiction book into a chilling docudrama that retains a disturbing power even today, thirty five years later."
"4363","tt0061809","2747","3","Robert Blake and Scott Wilson portray Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, two ex cons who, on a tip from Hicock's old cellmate Floyd Wells, broke into the Holcomb, Kansas home of Herbert Clutter, looking for a wall safe supposedly containing $10,000."
"4364","tt0061809","2747","4","But no safe was ever found, and the two men instead wound up killing Mr."
"4365","tt0061809","2747","5","Clutter, his wife, and their two children, getting away with only a radio, a pair of binoculars, and a lousy forty dollars."
"4366","tt0061809","2747","6","Two months on the run, including an aimless ""vacation"" in northern Mexico, ended in Las Vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car."

"4368","tt0061809","2747","8","Tried and convicted on four counts of murder, they stew in jail over a five year period of appeals and denials until both are hanged to death on April 14, 1965."
"4369","tt0061809","2747","9","Blake and Smith are absolutely chilling as the two dispassionate killers who show no remorse for what they've done but are concerned about getting caught."
"4370","tt0061809","2747","10","John Forsythe also does a good turn as Alvin Dewey, the chief detective investigating the crime, as does Gerald S."
"4371","tt0061809","2747","11","O'Laughlin as his assistant."
"4372","tt0061809","2747","12","In a tactic that is both faithful to Capote's book and a good artistic gambit all around, Brooks does not show the murders at the beginning; instead, he shows the two killers pulling up to the Clutter house as the last light goes out, then cuts to the next morning and the horrifying discovery of the bodies."
"4373","tt0061809","2747","13","Only during the ride back to Kansas, when Blake is questioned by Forsythe and narrates the story, do we see the true horror of what happened that night."
"4374","tt0061809","2747","14","We don't see that much blood being spilled in these scenes, but we don't need to."
"4375","tt0061809","2747","15","The shotgun blasts and the horrified look on the Clutters' faces as they know they are about to die are more than disturbing enough, so there is no need to resort to explicitly bloody slasher film violence."
"4376","tt0061809","2747","16","Brooks wisely filmed IN COLD BLOOD in stark black and white, and the results are excellent thanks to Conrad Hall's expertise."
"4377","tt0061809","2747","17","The chilling jazz score by Quincy Jones is the capper."
"4378","tt0061809","2747","18","The end result is one of the most unsettling films of any kind ever made, devastating in its own low key fashion."
"4379","tt0061809","2747","19","It is a 134 minute study of a crime that shook an entire state and indeed an entire nation, and should be seen, though viewer discretion is advised; the 'R' rating is there for a reason."
"4380","tt0063374","11536","1","It's hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become, especially if, like me, you happen to like the TV show more."
"4381","tt0063374","11536","2","But there's a lot to be said for the source."
"4382","tt0063374","11536","3","Oscar Madison Walter Matthau is a top New York City sportswriter who lives in an eight room apartment by himself, a casualty of divorce and his own stubbornly sloppy mindset."
"4383","tt0063374","11536","4","Enter his friend Felix Ungar Jack Lemmon, needing a place to live after his wife threw him out for his stubbornly neatnik mindset."
"4384","tt0063374","11536","5","The result is a train wreck and one of the most beloved movie adaptations of a Neil Simon stage play."
"4385","tt0063374","11536","6","First thing's first: I love that apartment!"
"4386","tt0063374","11536","7","Poker table, novelty dart board, askew photos of baseball players, empty booze and beer containers, even a pair of Roman columns."
"4387","tt0063374","11536","8","It's a place where men can be boys."
"4388","tt0063374","11536","9","Simon and director Gene Saks do a great job opening up the stage play's single set, Oscar's living room, by moving the action into the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the mounting tension between Oscar and Felix more corners to bounce off of."
"4389","tt0063374","11536","10","Neal Hefti's familiar score was heard on the TV show, but never so sweepingly orchestrated as it is here, in several different arrangements that make the on screen action soar whenever its played."
"4390","tt0063374","11536","11","Real location work and night shots of Manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot in that place and time ""Buddwing,"" ""The World Of Henry Orient,"" ""Midnight Cowboy,"" ""Manchurian Candidate,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" etc."
"4391","tt0063374","11536","12","Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy in comparison to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman."
"4392","tt0063374","11536","13","To be fair, the movie is meant to be a more serious affair, dealing with the then uncommon condition of mid life divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work."
"4393","tt0063374","11536","14","Simon has more in mind than entering Felix and Oscar in a game of ""Password"" or a battle of wits with Howard Cosell."
"4394","tt0063374","11536","15","But I don't know..."
"4395","tt0063374","11536","16","Both Lemmon and Matthau were terrific comedians I enjoy watching especially in the middle of this film as I often do in their separate movies, but I never understood why they were regarded as a great comedy team."
"4396","tt0063374","11536","17","Here, in their best regarded partnership, they seem to be acting in two different films; Lemmon in a comedy drama and Matthau in a farce."
"4397","tt0063374","11536","18","Matthau is great in the beginning, charming us with his teddy bear demeanor around the poker table, but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like Jack Torrance's in ""The Shining,"" reacting to Felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blame."
"4398","tt0063374","11536","19","While the ending bothers me, the part many see as the most jarring, the beginning, works fine as I see it."
"4399","tt0063374","11536","20","Watching Felix stumbling around trying to kill himself isn't great comedy, no, but it's a good way to get into a great comedy, setting us up with some real life pain before bringing in the warmth and laughter."
"4400","tt0063374","11536","21","Plus it has some great shots of the seedier parts of the city."
"4401","tt0063374","11536","22","In the middle of the movie, this scene would have been a miscalculation, but it works as a way of establishing Felix's torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see Oscar and his poker friends bicker and feud."
"4402","tt0063374","11536","23","That's where Simon's lines are so great."
"4403","tt0063374","11536","24","They are the underlying strength of the film."
"4404","tt0063374","11536","25","He gets the banter exactly right and real, and still makes it funny."
"4405","tt0063374","11536","26","""I don't mind you talking, Felix."
"4406","tt0063374","11536","27","You got things to say."
"4407","tt0063374","11536","28","What's scaring me is I'm beginning to listen."""
"4408","tt0063374","11536","29","The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better, in fact the TV show once made a good point about ""assuming"" anything at all, but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right."
"4409","tt0063374","11537","1","Neil Simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON as opposite types in THE ODD COUPLE a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartment."
"4410","tt0063374","11537","2","Lemmon is neatnik Felix Ungar, bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with Oscar Madison Matthau with somewhat disastrous results."
"4411","tt0063374","11537","3","Seems that everything Felix says and does drives Oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other's ways, with Oscar being the messiest male imaginable and Felix the exact opposite."
"4412","tt0063374","11537","4","Funniest scene for me was when the giggling Pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date."
"4413","tt0063374","11537","5","The priceless interaction between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put you in stitches."
"4414","tt0063374","11537","6","The talented Pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the Gabble Sisters a pair of geese in Disney's THE ARISTOCATS, and here their comic timing on top of Lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity where it remains much of the time."
"4415","tt0063374","11537","7","If you're a Neil Simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work, this one is not to be missed."
"4416","tt0063374","11537","8","Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly cast even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began and, of course, it's easy to see why it became a top rated TV show later on."
"4417","tt0063374","11537","9","Summing up: Top Simon comedy, not to be missed."
"4418","tt0063374","11538","1","Felix Unger Jack Lemmon has just been dumped by his wife, because he is one of the most annoying , neurotic people in the world."
"4419","tt0063374","11538","2","Suicide is his way out, but he just can't seem to get it to work, so he heads over to his friends house."
"4420","tt0063374","11538","3","Oscar Madison Walther Matthau is also recently divorced and living it up in bachelor heaven."
"4421","tt0063374","11538","4","Smoking, gambling, hitting on chicks, eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him."
"4422","tt0063374","11538","5","Well, with the suicide attempts Oscar decides to let Felix move in."
"4423","tt0063374","11538","6","At first, it is a match made in heaven, Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar pay his alimony on time, but soon Oscar is jonesing for women and Felix who in today's world would probably be gay isn't ready to move on."
"4424","tt0063374","11538","7","They invite a couple of British birds over and they find Felix so tender that soon they and Felix are weeping and chatting about his family life, leaving Oscar denied."
"4425","tt0063374","11538","8","This is it, he explodes and throws him out, but Felix isn't as helpless as it seems, and soon he has the upper hand."
"4426","tt0063374","11538","9","My favorite quote ""You leave me little notes on my pillow."
"4427","tt0063374","11538","10","Told you 158 times I can't stand little notes on my pillow."
"4428","tt0063374","11538","11","""We're all out of cornflakes."
"4429","tt0063374","11538","12","F.U."""
"4430","tt0063374","11538","13","Took me three hours to figure out F.U. was Felix Ungar!"""
"4431","tt0063374","11538","14","Based on a Neil Simon play who also wrote the screenplay, this has a certain theatre feel to it."
"4432","tt0063374","11538","15","Set and the repartee and looks feel quite play like for better or worse."
"4433","tt0063374","11538","16","Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the Grumpier Old Men movies and Out to Sea, reprising the same finicky/slob roles, but with different names to avoid royalty issues, I'm sure."
"4434","tt0063374","11538","17","This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate."
"4435","tt0063374","11538","18","The chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, the strawberry is tart, juicy and bright red unless you get those nasty greenish ones."
"4436","tt0063374","11538","19","They are almost polar opposites, but together, the contrasts highlight each other and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"
"4437","tt0063374","11539","1","THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon's most famous play about a TV newswriter named Felix Unger, who is an obsessive neat freak, who moves in with his divorced best friend, Oscar Madison, a sportswriter and complete slob, after his wife Frances throws him out of their apartment."
"4438","tt0063374","11539","2","Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it."
"4439","tt0063374","11539","3","Neil Simon's classic comedy first came to Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar."
"4440","tt0063374","11539","4","Jack Lemmon takes over for Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger."
"4441","tt0063374","11539","5","Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger."
"4442","tt0063374","11539","6","Matthau, fortunately, was allowed to recreate his role as Oscar, a one of a kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout."
"4443","tt0063374","11539","7","This teaming of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re visited in nine other films."
"4444","tt0063374","11539","8","With both of these actors no longer with us, the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious."
"4445","tt0063374","11539","9","Simon's play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed Felix's suicide attempt that is a winner."
"4446","tt0063374","11539","10","The supporting cast includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines, and David Sheiner as Oscar's poker playing buddies and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon Sisters, blind dates of Oscar and Felix."
"4447","tt0063374","11539","11","Of course, it later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there's nothing like the original."
"4448","tt0063374","11539","12","A joy from start to finish."
"4449","tt0063374","11540","1","This is the Neil Simon piece of work that got a lot of praises!"
"4450","tt0063374","11540","2","""The Odd Couple"" is a one of a kind gem that lingers within."
"4451","tt0063374","11540","3","You got Felix UngarJack Lemmon; a hypochondriac, fussy neat freak, and a big thorn in the side of his roommate, Oscar MadisonWalter Matthau; a total slob."
"4452","tt0063374","11540","4","These men have great jobs though."
"4453","tt0063374","11540","5","Felix is a news writer, and Oscar is a sports writer."
"4454","tt0063374","11540","6","Both of these men are divorced, Felix's wife is nearby, while Oscar's is on the other side of the U.S."
"4455","tt0063374","11540","7","The West Coast."
"4456","tt0063374","11540","8","Well, what can you say."
"4457","tt0063374","11540","9","Two men living in one roof together without driving each other crazy, is impossible as well as improbable."
"4458","tt0063374","11540","10","It's a whole lot of laughs and a whole lot of fun."
"4459","tt0063374","11540","11","I liked the part where when those two British neighbors that speak to both gentlemen, and after Oscar kicked out Felix, he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier."
"4460","tt0063374","11540","12","It's about time that Felix needed to lighten up."
"4461","tt0063374","11540","13","I guess all neat freaks neat to lighten up."
"4462","tt0063374","11540","14","They can be fussy, yet they should be patient as well."
"4463","tt0063374","11540","15","A very fun movie, and a nuevo classic."
"4464","tt0063374","11540","16","Neil Simon's ""The Odd Couple"" is a must see classic movie."
"4465","tt0063374","11540","17","5 STARS!"
"4466","tt0063374","11541","1","Matthau and Lemmon are at their very best in this one everyone else in the movie are also great."
"4467","tt0063374","11541","2","The Dialogue is excellent and very, very witty and the scene where Lemmon's character attempts to clear out his sinuses in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time I see it."
"4468","tt0063374","11541","3","Anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original."
"4469","tt0063374","11541","4","I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone I just love it."
"4470","tt0063374","11541","5","And the fact the Jack Lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion."
"4471","tt0063374","11541","6","These two great guys made a string of movies together, but this one is the best no doubt."
"4472","tt0063374","11542","1","The first time I saw this, I didn't laugh too much."
"4473","tt0063374","11542","2","At the time, I was only about fifteen years old and thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time."
"4474","tt0063374","11542","3","I had the same reaction when I viewed it a second time a few months ago, and this time, it was because Felix's aborted suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened the movie a bit."
"4475","tt0063374","11542","4","This scene made some of the things Oscar said and did to Felix later in the movie seem needlessly cruel, and their personality clashes weren't as amusing as they could have been."
"4476","tt0063374","11542","5","Had I not already known the story, I would have been worried that some of Oscar's antics to Felix might push him over the edge."
"4477","tt0063374","11542","6","As it was, it didn't make me laugh or smile like the television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall did."
"4478","tt0063374","11542","7","Still, all in all, a pretty good movie and it spawned one of the greatest sitcoms on television. 7 out of 10."
"4479","tt0063374","11543","1","Neil Simon has quite a body of work, but it is the Odd Couple that carried him to fame."
"4480","tt0063374","11543","2","This film really works."
"4481","tt0063374","11543","3","Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthaw have a great chemistry."
"4482","tt0063374","11543","4","The supporting cast for this film is stellar as well."
"4483","tt0063374","11543","5","It is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets."
"4484","tt0063374","11543","6","The script bristles with humor from this situation."
"4485","tt0063374","11543","7","This had been done in some forms previously."
"4486","tt0063374","11543","8","This is the one that brings it all together in a very good package."
"4487","tt0063374","11543","9","Simon has done some other decent work, but this one is really his best work which made the rest of his work possible."
"4488","tt0063374","11543","10","It is hard to imagine Simon ever topping this."
"4489","tt0063374","11544","1","Some of the best movies that are categorized as ""comedies"" actually blur between comedy and drama."
"4490","tt0063374","11544","2","""The Graduate"" and ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", which were made also in the late 1960's are perfect examples."
"4491","tt0063374","11544","3","Are they comedies with dramatic undertones, or dramas with a lot of humor."
"4492","tt0063374","11544","4","In many respects, ""The Odd Couple"" falls into this same category of being both comedy yet highly dramatic with deep underpinnings about human nature."
"4493","tt0063374","11544","5","Much of what happens may be funny to the audience but the characters are not laughing."
"4494","tt0063374","11544","6","Despite the rather light hearted TV show of the 1970's, the original ""Odd Couple"" is not merely about a neat guy and messy guy who are forced to live together because of their marital situation."
"4495","tt0063374","11544","7","It's really about two opposites who must face why their marriages fell apart and how their detrimental idiosyncrasies reveal themselves outside of their marriage."
"4496","tt0063374","11544","8","Neatness, the characteristic of Felix Ungar Jack Lemon perfectly cast and messiness, the characteristic of Oscar Madison Walter Matthau, are only the beginning and somewhat superficial."
"4497","tt0063374","11544","9","As the story unfolds, we find there is a lot more to these men than simply neatness versus messiness."
"4498","tt0063374","11544","10","Briefly, the story is really about Felix Ungar, who has to face an impending divorce from his wife Francis, who we never meet but is an important character throughout the story."
"4499","tt0063374","11544","11","On the verge of suicide, Ungar goes to the only place he knows: the apartment of Oscar Madison where a group of poker buddies hang out every so often."
"4500","tt0063374","11544","12","We learn that Ungar is not only a member of this ""poker club"" but the group knows what's happening to him and try, in their inept way, to help out."
"4501","tt0063374","11544","13","Madison figures the best way to help Ungar is to let him move in with him until his suicidal tendencies wear off."
"4502","tt0063374","11544","14","Unfortunately for Madison, he doesn't know what he's getting himself into."
"4503","tt0063374","11544","15","Madison is a carefree happy go lucky if rather irresponsible slob who's refrigerator was last cleaned probably when Herbert Hoover was still in the White House."
"4504","tt0063374","11544","16","Madison's idea of serving snacks is grabbing moldy cheese and sticking them in between two pieces of bread, and then throwing the contents of a bag of chips on the table."
"4505","tt0063374","11544","17","On the other hand, he enjoys booze and women, in short having a good time."
"4506","tt0063374","11544","18","Ungar is not only altogether different, he is diametrically opposite."
"4507","tt0063374","11544","19","He is not only an obsessive neatness nut that finds more joy in disinfecting the apartment than meeting women but he knows more than most women do about cooking and fine eating."
"4508","tt0063374","11544","20","At one point, he calls his ex wife, not to talk about reconciling, but to get her recipe for meatloaf."
"4509","tt0063374","11544","21","At another moment, Ungar was going to spend the rest of the evening cutting cabbage for coleslaw."
"4510","tt0063374","11544","22","When Madison seems unimpressed, Ungar finally confesses he was only doing it for his roommate because he can't stand coleslaw."
"4511","tt0063374","11544","23","Who is this guy."
"4512","tt0063374","11544","24","But he has another endearing trait: Felix is also a hypochondriac."
"4513","tt0063374","11544","25","He obsesses about his health to the point where he makes strange noises in public places claiming he's helping his sinuses."
"4514","tt0063374","11544","26","He seems to have every health condition in the book."
"4515","tt0063374","11544","27","And if they made up more, Felix would probably have them."
"4516","tt0063374","11544","28","Ultimately, he is overly self absorbed."
"4517","tt0063374","11544","29","Running throughout the movie are references to marriage."
"4518","tt0063374","11544","30","At one point when Madison is trying to convince Ungar to move in, he says, ""What do you want, a wedding ring."""
"4519","tt0063374","11544","31","But little does he know that it is not the neat guy who can't deal with the messy guy, but the other way around."
"4520","tt0063374","11544","32","Their friendship becomes an inadvertent hellish relationship."
"4521","tt0063374","11544","33","And the climax occurs when Oscar invites two lonely British sisters for a get together with both comedic and tragic results."
"4522","tt0063374","11544","34","This is one of the best comedies of its type ever written and not to be missed, with superlative performances by Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon in roles that are hard to imagine better played by anyone else."
"4523","tt0063374","11544","35","It is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly lacking from most comedies being produced today."
"4524","tt0063374","11545","1","The original movie, The Odd Couple, has some wonderful comic one liners."
"4525","tt0063374","11545","2","The entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat freak Felix Ungar and funny, obnoxious, slob Oscar Madison."
"4526","tt0063374","11545","3","This paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful TV series of all time as well as countless, not anywhere near as good, imitations."
"4527","tt0063374","11545","4","The Odd Couple movie has some wonderful jokes about Oscar's apartment and his sloppy habits."
"4528","tt0063374","11545","5","He says, ""Who wants food."""
"4529","tt0063374","11545","6","One of his poker player buddies asks, ""What do ya got."""
"4530","tt0063374","11545","7","Oscar says, ""I got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches."""
"4531","tt0063374","11545","8","""What's the brown."""
"4532","tt0063374","11545","9","It's either very new cheese or very old meat!"""
"4533","tt0063374","11545","10","I also love the line about Oscar's refrigerator, ""It's been out of order for two weeks, I saw milk standing in there that wasn't even in a bottle!"""
"4534","tt0063374","11545","11","There is no question that Walter Matthau's Oscar Madison is a joy to watch on screen."
"4535","tt0063374","11545","12","He's almost as good as Jack Klugman's version in the TV series."
"4536","tt0063374","11545","13","The problem with the movie is Jack Lemmon's Felix Ungar."
"4537","tt0063374","11545","14","Jack makes a very, very, honest effort at the role."
"4538","tt0063374","11545","15","The problem is that he makes Felix SO depressing and down trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical."
"4539","tt0063374","11545","16","Tony Randall's performance in the series, brought the kind of humor, warmth, and sensitivity, to Felix's character, which Lemmon's portrayal lacks."
"4540","tt0063374","11545","17","Tony's Felix Unger obviously could be annoying some of the time."
"4541","tt0063374","11545","18","However, in the TV series, it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline."
"4542","tt0063374","11545","19","Jack's Felix Ungar, note the different spelling in the movie, seems to never be happy, fun, or interesting."
"4543","tt0063374","11545","20","The movie Felix Ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall, all the time."
"4544","tt0063374","11545","21","The movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time, the ""famous"" meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever!"
"4545","tt0063374","11545","22","One of the other great examples of Felix's ""little notes"" on Oscar's pillow will be remembered forever."
"4546","tt0063374","11545","23","However, there are some darker sides where Oscar goes over the top, His ""crying"" near the end after bawling out Felix, and a scene involving Felix's Linguine dinner, although lightened by a funny line. seem more depressing than comical."
"4547","tt0063374","11545","24","Perhaps there wasn't enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie."
"4548","tt0063374","11545","25","The beginning 20 minutes are very boring."
"4549","tt0063374","11545","26","The same issue occurs with Felix's conversation with the Pidgeon Sisters."
"4550","tt0063374","11545","27","The movie's ending is predictable and too pat."
"4551","tt0063374","11545","28","There's very little care or compassion for each of them by the other."
"4552","tt0063374","11545","29","The result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger, rather than comedy, unless you are watching the great scenes described above."
"4553","tt0063374","11545","30","It appears that Jack Lemmon's monotone persona of Felix brings the film down, rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters."
"4554","tt0063374","11545","31","It really took the 1970's TV series to make The Odd Couple the best that it could be."
"4555","tt0063374","11545","32","The original film is still very good."
"4556","tt0063374","11545","33","However, the TV series is much better."
"4557","tt0063374","11546","1","First ever viewing: July 21, 2008Very impressive screenplay and comedic acting and timing in this film."
"4558","tt0063374","11546","2","Now 40 years old, it has lost none of it's power."
"4559","tt0063374","11546","3","Neil Simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations."
"4560","tt0063374","11546","4","Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedic performances."
"4561","tt0063374","11546","5","Neil Simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based on."
"4562","tt0063374","11546","6","One of the best written and acted Hollywood comedies of all time!"
"4563","tt0063374","11546","7","Surprisingly, only nominated for 2 Academy Awards: ""Best Adapted Screenplay"" and ""Best Film Editing""."
"4564","tt0063374","11546","8","Hollywood rarely awards comedies, no matter how well they are made."
"4565","tt0063374","11547","1","and laugh out loud funny in many scenes."
"4566","tt0063374","11547","2","The movie's basic plot is well chronicled, a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximity."
"4567","tt0063374","11547","3","This is unquestionably Lemmon and Matheau's best film as co stars, and the interaction between the sloppy Oscar and the OCD Felix are classic."
"4568","tt0063374","11547","4","The scene where Oscar lines up a double date, leaves the room briefly, and comes back to find Felix and the two girls all crying is pricelessly funny."
"4569","tt0063374","11547","5","For any fan of intelligent comedies, The Odd Couple is a ""go out of your way to see it"" film."
"4570","tt0063374","11548","1","Based on Neil Simons play of the same The Odd Couple tells the story of best friends Felix UngerJack Lemmonand Oscar MadisonWalter Matthauwho end up sharing Oscars massive bachelor pad after Felix tries to kill himself."
"4571","tt0063374","11548","2","He had a big row with his wife over his obsessive compulsive cleaning sprees and weird phobias and sends her a suicide telegram."
"4572","tt0063374","11548","3","She calls Oscar and lets him know what happened."
"4573","tt0063374","11548","4","Felix turns up at Oscar's during his weekly poker game with their friends VinnieJohn FielderMurray the policemanHerbert EdelmanRoyDavid Sheinerand SpeedLarry Haines."
"4574","tt0063374","11548","5","After some side splitting hysterics it's agreed Felix will stay with Oscar."
"4575","tt0063374","11548","6","The rest of the film centres on how these two are such completely different characters."
"4576","tt0063374","11548","7","As well as looking at if Oscar can stand Felix's truly weird and unique habits and cleanliness and if Felix can stand Oscar being such a slob and his laid back attitude to everything."
"4577","tt0063374","11548","8","Really a film about two complete opposites living together and the joys,highs,lows and necessity of the gift that is friendship."
"4578","tt0063374","11548","9","With great acting an intelligent and very funny script and the great Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as the British Pigeon sisters who Oscar invites over for a double date."
"4579","tt0063374","11548","10","This one is guaranteed to make you laugh every line is priceless and Jack and Walter are fantastic with a great chemistry."
"4580","tt0063374","11548","11","Also made into a successful and equally funny TV series with Jack Klugman as Oscar and Tony Randall as Felix."
"4581","tt0063374","11549","1","There's nothing really to dislike about ""The Odd Couple,"" and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau make a hugely winning comedic team."
"4582","tt0063374","11549","2","But there's something so underdeveloped about Neil Simon's adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full bodied film."
"4583","tt0063374","11549","3","I have not seen the play, but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful, since Simon wrote it, so the defects cannot be blamed on a stage to screen adaptation."
"4584","tt0063374","11549","4","There are some interesting ideas in this story two recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differently that Simon never fully fleshes out."
"4585","tt0063374","11549","5","Still, there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours."
"4586","tt0063374","11550","1","If you delete the first twenty minutes or so of this film, you will be left with a fantastic comedy."
"4587","tt0063374","11550","2","As it is, I still found it to be a pretty good movie, which is no small feat considering the coma I was put in by the opening scenes."
"4588","tt0063374","11550","3","To put it mildly, this film has a dreary beginning that wasn't even remotely funny, or even upbeat."
"4589","tt0063374","11550","4","Once things get sillier, however, you are left with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades."
"4590","tt0063374","11550","5","Definitely worth checking out, especially if you're a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who wants to see their earlier work."
"4591","tt0063374","11551","1","THE ODD COUPLE 3+ outta 5 starsLike most people I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definitive ""Odd Couple""."
"4592","tt0063374","11551","2","Their incredible work on the TV series from the early to mid 70s was a highwater mark for television at the time... easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale."
"4593","tt0063374","11551","3","Nonetheless, how can you go wrong with a Jack Lemmon/Walter Matthau pairing."
"4594","tt0063374","11551","4","Matthau is in especially good form as Oscar, the slob."
"4595","tt0063374","11551","5","Lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as Felix, particularly if you have previously seen Tony Randall's outstanding performance."
"4596","tt0063374","11551","6","The script is good... definitely Neil Simon's best."
"4597","tt0063374","11551","7","I will go on record here as stating that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most over rated playwrights of American theatre."
"4598","tt0063374","11551","8","The storyline is simple: Felix, a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with Oscar, the slob who needs some help saving money for alimony payments."
"4599","tt0063374","11551","9","Their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well, culminating in some amusing tiffs and spats."
"4600","tt0063374","11551","10","Lots of fun and some great one liners."
"4601","tt0063374","11552","1","Here's another film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation."
"4602","tt0063374","11552","2","It's a classic comedy, very funny and entertaining and which, of course, ultimately inspired a successful television series which many would say was even better I enjoy both, personally."
"4603","tt0063374","11552","3","For some, it's hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were were weaned on the TV show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman or perhaps vice versa."
"4604","tt0063374","11552","4","But what we've got there in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own."
"4605","tt0063374","11552","5","It's Neil Simon's humorous material that's key, and where the laughs really originate from."
"4606","tt0063374","11552","6","For those who have somehow never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat freak Lemmon who is thrown out of a 12 year marriage by his long suffering wife and takes up residence in the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy Matthau."
"4607","tt0063374","11552","7","Pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely funny predicaments."
"4608","tt0063374","11553","1","There's more to offer in the opening of The Odd Couple than in the entirety of most films."
"4609","tt0063374","11553","2","Felix Unger the poor guy's monogram even curses him checks into a New York hotel."
"4610","tt0063374","11553","3","A cleaning lady says ""Good night."""
"4611","tt0063374","11553","4","""Goodbye,"" he answers back."
"4612","tt0063374","11553","5","In his room he empties his pockets, then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope, addressed to his wife and beloved children."
"4613","tt0063374","11553","6","When the viewer finally puts it together  aha, he's going to off himself  we watch him struggle to open the window  oh no, he's going to jump  The poor guy injures his lower back."
"4614","tt0063374","11553","7","This is all you need to know about Felix Unger  his wife has left him, he's a compulsive cleaner and he's a hypochondriac."
"4615","tt0063374","11553","8","And all in one scene."
"4616","tt0063374","11553","9","This is the particular genius of Neil Simon's comedy  it's about situation and character."
"4617","tt0063374","11553","10","There are few obvious physical jokes  no kicks to the groin, no cheap gags  just funny characters in uncomfortable situations."
"4618","tt0063374","11553","11","And, of course, he is a master of manipulating the audience's expectations."
"4619","tt0063374","11553","12","Coming from the Swingers era, imagine what I thought in the date scene when Felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate Oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment."
"4620","tt0063374","11553","13","He's blowing it, right."
"4621","tt0063374","11553","14","Think again."
"4622","tt0063374","11553","15","The girls love his sensitivity, his ability to cry in front of them."
"4623","tt0063374","11553","16","They invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because Oscar wasn't paying enough attention to it."
"4624","tt0063374","11553","17","He's in like Flynn, right."
"4625","tt0063374","11553","18","Uh, yes, but he doesn't want to go with the girls because he's feeling vulnerable."
"4626","tt0063374","11553","19","Great stuff."
"4627","tt0063374","11553","20","And it's made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight room apartment set."
"4628","tt0063374","11553","21","You've got Jack Lemmon and the slouchy, pouchy Walter Matthau for Chrissakes, why mess it up."
"4629","tt0063374","11553","22","The visual style reminded me of Breakfast at Tiffany's, in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action."
"4630","tt0063374","11553","23","Particularly memorable is the scene in which Felix, fleeing from Oscar, closes a partition only to realize the partition doesn't cover the side where Oscar is coming from."
"4631","tt0063374","11553","24","You get a real sense of the layout of the apartment, and thus the proximity in which the two divorcées live."
"4632","tt0063374","11553","25","The twist here is that these two are really married  to each other."
"4633","tt0063374","11553","26","So the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys."
"4634","tt0063374","11554","1","I don't think I've really ever given Walter Matthau his due as a comedic performer."
"4635","tt0063374","11554","2","He's certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles, but I guess I always put his success down to his characters' grumpiness and ruthlessness, a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co star Jack Lemmon, and, I suppose, a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures."
"4636","tt0063374","11554","3","Watching Gene Saks' 'The Odd Couple 1968,' adapted from a popular Neil Simon play, the realisation suddenly clicked: Matthau is, in his own right, absolutely hilarious!"
"4637","tt0063374","11554","4","Initially striking the audience as filthy, crude and generally unappealing, his Oscar Madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts, culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that Matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own."
"4638","tt0063374","11554","5","At the same time, while holding his own as a comedian, his interplay with Lemmon is, of course, pitch perfect; indeed, the film rightly belongs to both actors, who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves, let alone together."
"4639","tt0063374","11554","6","Calling to mind Billy Wilder's screenplay for 'The Apartment 1960,' this Neil Simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise."
"4640","tt0063374","11554","7","Compulsive house cleaner Felix Unger Lemmon, having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years, attempts to commit suicide, but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window."
"4641","tt0063374","11554","8","Dejected, he arrives at the house of good friend Oscar Matthau, a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat!."
"4642","tt0063374","11554","9","Oscar kindly offers Felix a place to stay, but is soon overwhelmed by his friend's finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness."
"4643","tt0063374","11554","10","The pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement, with Felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly nagging wife, and Oscar as the sloppy, unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he's supposed to."
"4644","tt0063374","11554","11","This is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks, and, by the end of it, we can completely sympathise with Felix's ex wife, who remains unseen.'"
"4645","tt0063374","11554","12","The Odd Couple' is a terrific comedy, most of all because it has a lot of heart."
"4646","tt0063374","11554","13","For all their arguing, it's obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other, most movingly seen when Felix tries to launch into a furious tirade, instead  perhaps inadvertently  ending up informing Oscar how ""tops"" he his."
"4647","tt0063374","11554","14","The pair's four poker buddies John Fiedler, Herb Edelman, David Sheiner and Larry Haines are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance, but you can't deny that they've got the best of intentions."
"4648","tt0063374","11554","15","Their decision to treat Felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory, but maybe being ignored wasn't quite the correct solution to Felix's gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality."
"4649","tt0063374","11554","16","Unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays I was recently disappointed by Wilder's 'The Seven Year Itch 1955, this film doesn't simply strike at the same chord throughout, and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed, through tears, laughter and much disagreement."
"4650","tt0063374","11555","1","A simple comment..."
"4651","tt0063374","11555","2","What can I say... this is a wonderful film that I can watch over and over."
"4652","tt0063374","11555","3","It is definitely one of the top ten comedies made."
"4653","tt0063374","11555","4","With a great cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau wording a perfect script by Neil Simon, based on his play."
"4654","tt0063374","11555","5","It is real to life situation done perfectly."
"4655","tt0063374","11555","6","If you have digital cable, one gets the menu on bottom of screen to give what is on."
"4656","tt0063374","11555","7","It usually gives this film % stars but in reality it deserves  stars."
"4657","tt0063374","11555","8","If you really watch this film, one can tell that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred years from now."
"4658","tt0063374","11556","1","Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began and ending their career together."
"4659","tt0063374","11556","2","Remember best as the Grumpiest of Old Men as well as the Oddest Couple to have ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years."
"4660","tt0063374","11556","3","Not as ""raunchy"" as Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine."
"4661","tt0063374","11556","4","Such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for."
"4662","tt0063374","11556","5","In the Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos."
"4663","tt0063374","11556","6","The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins."
"4664","tt0063374","11556","7","The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another."
"4665","tt0063374","11556","8","Not your typical guy film, it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime."
"4666","tt0063374","11556","9","The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertainment enough."
"4667","tt0063374","11556","10","Although this movie isn't for everyone, this is a great comedy."
"4668","tt0063374","11557","1","Often laugh out loud, sometimes sad story of 2 working divorced guys Lemmon a neurotic clean ""house husband"" and Matthau a slob sportswriter who decide to live together to cut down on expenses."
"4669","tt0063374","11557","2","Nicely photographed and directed."
"4670","tt0063374","11557","3","The script is very barbed that is, there's always more than one side to almost every line."
"4671","tt0063374","11557","4","Particularly funny scene involves 2 british sisters Evans and Shelley who seem amused by everything anyone says, but when Lemmon busts out his photos of kids and, yes, ex wife to be, he has the girls sobbing along with him before Matthau can show up with the promised drinks!"
"4672","tt0063374","11557","5","Very entertaining."
"4673","tt0063374","11558","1","""The Odd Couple"" is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation."
"4674","tt0063374","11558","2","People all know it, they hum the theme song, they complain of living with a sloppy ""Oscar"" or a fastidious ""Felix""...but they're under selling the film without knowing it."
"4675","tt0063374","11558","3","This isn't just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy; it's a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce."
"4676","tt0063374","11558","4","It's also damn funny from start to finish, but it's the kind of comedy that arises from realistic, stressful, and just plain awful situations."
"4677","tt0063374","11558","5","So, some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable, but I think its verisimilitude is its strength."
"4678","tt0063374","11558","6","Besides, Matthau's bulldog face just cracks me up!"
"4679","tt0063374","11558","7","My favorite comedy, by a country mile."
"4680","tt0063374","11559","1","The Odd Couple is a comic gem."
"4681","tt0063374","11559","2","One the funniest script ever committed to celluloid exceeded only by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski!"
"4682","tt0063374","11559","3","Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: obsessive compulsive Felix and sloppy, irresponsible Oscar."
"4683","tt0063374","11559","4","Oscar's wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude."
"4684","tt0063374","11559","5","Felix's wife leaves him at the start of the movie, and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy Oscar."
"4685","tt0063374","11559","6","Thats when the fun begins."
"4686","tt0063374","11559","7","The entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant one liners."
"4687","tt0063374","11559","8","You are probably already familiar with the ""F.U."" joke but it still works brilliantly due to Matthau's comic timing."
"4688","tt0063374","11559","9","My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clear his sinus in the diner and when the Pigeon sisters are being charmed by a very suave Matthau and Lemmon is totally out of his element."
"4689","tt0063374","11559","10","This one requires repeat viewings!"
"4690","tt0063374","11560","1","Simon's best comedy is superbly crafted by director Gene Saks and given life by the immense talents of Lemmon and Matthau."
"4691","tt0063374","11560","2","No one delivers these lines better."
"4692","tt0063374","11560","3","No one times them better."
"4693","tt0063374","11560","4","Nobody does it better."
"4694","tt0063374","11561","1","This cordial comedy confronts a few bizarre characters."
"4695","tt0063374","11561","2","Especially, of course, the two leading characters."
"4696","tt0063374","11561","3","Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she couldn't stand his cleaning and cooking attacks any longer."
"4697","tt0063374","11561","4","So he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails."
"4698","tt0063374","11561","5","Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, an untidy, unreliable sports reporter who lives in divorce from his ex wife in a bachelor apartment."
"4699","tt0063374","11561","6","He offers his distressed friend Felix a new home in his apartment."
"4700","tt0063374","11561","7","And soon the trouble begins because two such contrary characters can't live together for a long time."
"4701","tt0063374","11561","8","Felix turns Oscar's disorderly flat into a clean exhibition flat."
"4702","tt0063374","11561","9","He cleans and cooks the whole time."
"4703","tt0063374","11561","10","After a short while, Oscar feels persecution mania ..."
"4704","tt0063374","11561","11","Filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted."
"4705","tt0063374","11561","12","Above all, Jack Lemmon's play is wonderful."
"4706","tt0063374","11561","13","He is the perfect clown."
"4707","tt0063374","11561","14","He makes us laugh but in a tragi comic way."
"4708","tt0063374","11561","15","Look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbours for supper, because Oscar has to touch something more softer than a bowling ball."
"4709","tt0063374","11561","16","While he is preparing the drinks, Felix sits with the two young ladies in the living room."
"4710","tt0063374","11561","17","To get out of this embarrassing situation, he starts to talk about the weather."
"4711","tt0063374","11561","18","A minute later, he changes the subject and talks about his ex wife and children."
"4712","tt0063374","11561","19","Suddenly he begins to weep and when Oscar comes back with the drinks, there are three weeping people in the living room."
"4713","tt0063374","11561","20","The film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes."
"4714","tt0063374","11561","21","An intelligent, entertaining comedy with much heart. 10 out of 10!"
"4715","tt0063374","11562","1","I simply can't get over how brilliant the pairing of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is."
"4716","tt0063374","11562","2","It's like the movie doesn't even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two."
"4717","tt0063374","11562","3","Lemmon had already been in several well known films like Mr."
"4718","tt0063374","11562","4","Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau was fresh off his Oscar win for The Fortune Cookie another Billy Wilder film also with Lemmon."
"4719","tt0063374","11562","5","That particular movie wasn't as great as this one because the story couldn't sustain such a long running time I think it was almost 2 hours."
"4720","tt0063374","11562","6","However, this goes by at a brisk hour and a half, even though the introduction of the events leading up to Lemmon ending up at Matthau's apartment is a tad long so was this sentence."
"4721","tt0063374","11562","7","That's a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous time."
"4722","tt0063374","11562","8","I have already written a comment about how the follow up to this film sucked and I won't go deeper into that."
"4723","tt0063374","11562","9","The reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of American movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion."
"4724","tt0063374","11562","10","There are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you couldn't even get a ""Well, I never..."" out of the most prudish person out there."
"4725","tt0063374","11562","11","It is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel didn't work because you had Matthau and Lemmon say quite a few f words and that just doesn't fit them."
"4726","tt0063374","11562","12","Of course, now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this."
"4727","tt0063374","11562","13","I think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is John Fiedler."
"4728","tt0063374","11562","14","Edelman died recently."
"4729","tt0063374","11562","15","So there you have it."
"4730","tt0063374","11562","16","Simply one of the best comedies and films ever."
"4731","tt0063374","11562","17","Add: I have just learned recently that John Fiedler has died so to all the fans of him I am deeply sorry."
"4732","tt0063374","11562","18","I didn't mean any disrespect and I will try to be more careful of what I am blah blah blahing next time."
"4733","tt0063374","11563","1","I saw this many years after the television series and, initially, I didn't care for it."
"4734","tt0063374","11563","2","Then, as my memory of the series receded with the passage of time, I watched again, and found it absolutely hilarious."
"4735","tt0063374","11563","3","Based on the stage play by Neil Simon, it has not been 'opened out' much for the big screen, and that's one of its strengths."
"4736","tt0063374","11563","4","Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and the supporting cast are wonderful, particularly John Fielder as 'Vinnie'."
"4737","tt0063374","11563","5","Even now, certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter Felix interrupting Oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request, Oscar cracking up and chasing Felix around the apartment, the giggling 'Pigeon Sisters' brought low by Felix's sob stories, and of course, the legendary cafeteria scene later ripped off by Nora Ephron's 'When Harry Met Sally' ."
"4738","tt0063374","11563","6","Razor sharp dialogue too."
"4739","tt0063374","11563","7","When the boys think Felix has taken an overdose, Oscar says: ""They could be vitamins!"
"4740","tt0063374","11563","8","He could be the healthiest one in the room!""."
"4741","tt0063374","11563","9","Fantastic!"
"4742","tt0063374","11564","1","I have seen this film many times and I like all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten but feel that it would be unfair to other good films."
"4743","tt0063374","11564","2","However, I do think that this is one of those rare gems: a perfect comedy."
"4744","tt0063374","11564","3","It is I would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times."
"4745","tt0063374","11564","4","Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched."
"4746","tt0063374","11564","5","The script is so sharp that you need to staunch the bleeding."
"4747","tt0063374","11564","6","The story is well known and has already been described in other comments."
"4748","tt0063374","11564","7","The two leads give extraordinary performances, the girls are superb and the situations are side splittingly funny."
"4749","tt0063374","11564","8","Not one swear word in sight mark that Hollywood, you don't have to swear to be funny, you have to be witty and the move from stage to film is seamless."
"4750","tt0063374","11564","9","They don't make'em like this any more."
"4751","tt0063374","11564","10","Timeless."
"4752","tt0063374","11565","1","SPOILERSIn the words of Jean Paul Sartre, ""Hell is other people""."
"4753","tt0063374","11565","2","In ""The Odd Couple"", Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau demonstrate just how accurate this can be."
"4754","tt0063374","11565","3","As Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together."
"4755","tt0063374","11565","4","As the two begin to slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other, the laughs come thick and fast, before Felix departs, leaving Oscar a changed and more cleanly individual."
"4756","tt0063374","11565","5","Jack Lemmon as Ungar is absolutely superb as the neurotic, cleaning obsessed divorcee coping with life as a single man."
"4757","tt0063374","11565","6","Walter Matthau in contrast to Lemmon's character is equally as good as the slobbish sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefits."
"4758","tt0063374","11565","7","Lemmon and Matthau are magnificant in their selected parts, to some degree dependent upon the beautiful script by Neil Simon, and simultaneously because they work well as a team."
"4759","tt0063374","11565","8","As two friends who are inherently different in lifestyles, although similar in relationships with ex wives and children, these two, late, great actors create a partnership which is practically impossible to recreate."
"4760","tt0063374","11565","9","So great in fact, that the world screamed out so much for something similar, that two years before Matthau's death and three before Lemmon's, the characters were reunited in an inferior sequel."
"4761","tt0063374","11565","10","This idea, whilst following Hollywood's irritating obsession with sequels, might have worked to a certain degree, but at the same time, it could never come close to replicating the genius of this original film."
"4762","tt0063374","11565","11","Ultimately it's not really possible to say anything else."
"4763","tt0063374","11565","12","With Simon's amazing script, filled with humour and laughter, the creators of this film were already onto a hit."
"4764","tt0063374","11565","13","The casting of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison though, is the most important part of this film."
"4765","tt0063374","11565","14","""The Odd Couple"", with it's traditional soundtrack which even gained a tribute in ""The Simpsons"", it's excellent script and it's genius leading men, is a tribute to cinema and a feature for history to remember."
"4766","tt0066817","6134","1","Certain DVD's possess me until I just have to go out and buy it."
"4767","tt0066817","6134","2","This was one of those movies."
"4768","tt0066817","6134","3","Like many on here, I remember seeing it as a child and loved it."
"4769","tt0066817","6134","4","I never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut, so I was intrigued to see what they might be."
"4770","tt0066817","6134","5","I will agree that the ""Portabellow Road"" sequence is now a tad long as is the soccer game but other than that, I found no qualms with the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectful place."
"4771","tt0066817","6134","6","Perhaps Disney should have had the original version which IS the restored version on one side with the restored version on the flip side, then people could choose what they wanted to view."
"4772","tt0066817","6134","7","All in all, it's still an entertaining movie that still manages to recapture some of my childhood memories."
"4773","tt0066817","6135","1","Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another one of Disney's masterpieces."
"4774","tt0066817","6135","2","It was filmed with sequences of animation and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations."
"4775","tt0066817","6135","3","A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when the children and Mary disappear into the sidewalk art."
"4776","tt0066817","6135","4","I am mainly rating this film through child's eyes because I have not seen it in years."
"4777","tt0066817","6135","5","Back then, it was one of my favourite films."
"4778","tt0066817","6135","6","It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes the conflict beginning with the ghostly armour walking into battle were my favourites."
"4779","tt0066817","6135","7","There was also a lot of stop animation used with the spells ie, people turning into rabbits, which may be a little dated and silly now."
"4780","tt0066817","6135","8","Also, I believe that the film starts off slowly."
"4781","tt0066817","6135","9","Through the eyes of a child, this is a fun film and it is easy for children to put themselves into the places of the children in the film."
"4782","tt0066817","6135","10","It is an imaginative film which is sadly largely forgotten today."
"4783","tt0066817","6136","1","i love bed knobs and broomsticks so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time i have the magnificent pleasure of seeing it. i would also like to reiterate the simple fact that i love it so much.too much some have said. i have 27 copies on video and i love them all equally. i also love anyone else who loves it. i love you. my favourite scene is the dance scene at portobello road. i have learned the dance moves and practice it everyday. i have some audio recordings of myself singing the song. if anyone can play the drums or guitar i am thinking of forming a bed knobs and broomsticks band.i hope to call it 'the knobs'. love me liz"
"4784","tt0066817","6137","1","What a great gem this is."
"4785","tt0066817","6137","2","It's an unusual story that is fun to watch."
"4786","tt0066817","6137","3","Yes, it has singing, but it is very nicely crafted into the story and is very melodic to hear."
"4787","tt0066817","6137","4","It was so pleasant to watch; I enjoyed it from start to finish!"
"4788","tt0066817","6137","5","The movie takes place in England during World War II."
"4789","tt0066817","6137","6","It is about an apprentice witch who is searching for a missing portion of a spell that she needs."
"4790","tt0066817","6137","7","She uses her rough ""magic"" to transport her and 3 children under her care to various destinations to find it."
"4791","tt0066817","6137","8","They are joined by her correspondence teacher, who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school actually work!"
"4792","tt0066817","6137","9","Although the special effects may seem a little dated at first, once you get used to them they become part of the charm of this movie."
"4793","tt0066817","6137","10","In fact, the movie won an Oscar for these effects!"
"4794","tt0066817","6137","11","The movie is innocent and fun and it's hard not to like the tuneful songs."
"4795","tt0066817","6137","12","The characters are wonderfully interesting to watch."
"4796","tt0066817","6137","13","I think anyone at any age could find something to like about this movie."
"4797","tt0066817","6138","1","This is an old fashioned, wonderfully fun children's movie with surely the most appealing novice witch ever."
"4798","tt0066817","6138","2","Unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft, this is simply a magical tale of hocus pocus that is cute, light hearted, and charming."
"4799","tt0066817","6138","3","The tale is set back in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye, where three Cockney children, Charlie, Carrie, & Paul Rollins, are being evacuated out of danger from World War II city air raids."
"4800","tt0066817","6138","4","They are mistakingly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch."
"4801","tt0066817","6138","5","Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their flying bed."
"4802","tt0066817","6138","6","Here they encounter Emilius Browne, the fraudulent headmaster of Miss Price's witchcraft training correspondence school."
"4803","tt0066817","6138","7","Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life."
"4804","tt0066817","6138","8","Meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called the Bookman and his associate, Swinburne."
"4805","tt0066817","6138","9","Angela Lansbury is of course marvelously endearing as the eccentric witch in training, Miss Price."
"4806","tt0066817","6138","10","David Tomlinson plays Mr."
"4807","tt0066817","6138","11","Browne, headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school, who has now turned street magician."
"4808","tt0066817","6138","12","This actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie Mary Poppins."
"4809","tt0066817","6138","13","In fact, this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins, both wonderful fantasy stories for children."
"4810","tt0066817","6138","14","Perhaps this movie doesn't have quite such memorable music as Chim Chim Cheree, but it does boast some appealing little tunes."
"4811","tt0066817","6138","15","Some have been critical, but the movie features excellent special effects."
"4812","tt0066817","6138","16","All in all, the story is enchanting family entertainment."
"4813","tt0066817","6138","17","It's a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely & bewitching tale, which should appeal to the child in all of us."
"4814","tt0066817","6139","1","A great movie."
"4815","tt0066817","6139","2","Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, with a particular mention for the ""Portobello Ballet"" are gorgeous."
"4816","tt0066817","6139","3","As for the animated section, the match between animals has become an instant classic; the climax with the attack of the armatures is chilling and fascinating."
"4817","tt0066817","6139","4","I recommend to see the restored 134 minutes version or at least the 112 minutes video."
"4818","tt0066817","6139","5","Here in Italy we have only the 98 minutes version, although the film was presented in its original release at the running of 117 minutes."
"4819","tt0066817","6139","6","If possible, watch also the German videocassette: it was generated from the 98 minutes running but it's missing of every refer to World War II and of all the scenes between English people and their Nazi invaders!"
"4820","tt0066817","6140","1","This movie is one of the best ever produced by disney."
"4821","tt0066817","6140","2","The plot is very original and entertaining."
"4822","tt0066817","6140","3","The animated sequence is also very well done with the live actors."
"4823","tt0066817","6140","4","For the time."
"4824","tt0066817","6140","5","Perhaps one of my favorite sequences is contained in this movie with the march of the suits of armor."
"4825","tt0066817","6141","1","Angela Lansbury plays Eglantine a middle aged lady in war torn England, during the WWI."
"4826","tt0066817","6141","2","She has been studying witchcraft by mail, and has been secretly learning it in her home, she is doing well, until three children who have been separated from their parents from the last air raid, are sent to stay in Angela Lansbury's huge house."
"4827","tt0066817","6141","3","She is not happy about having them, because of her secret."
"4828","tt0066817","6141","4","They only want to go back home."
"4829","tt0066817","6141","5","The oldest boy is very hard to get along with he is a brat."
"4830","tt0066817","6141","6","The other two a boy and a girl are just inquisitive about their new place to stay and the lady that is their hostess."
"4831","tt0066817","6141","7","The kids find out about her secret and that is when the fun begins."
"4832","tt0066817","6141","8","Fun and more of it."
"4833","tt0066817","6141","9","Family fun."
"4834","tt0066817","6141","10","Laughter, frolic, adventure, something for everyone."
"4835","tt0066817","6141","11","The special effects are quite good."
"4836","tt0066817","6141","12","This is a musical the tunes are every bit as catchy to sing later as any of the other Disney films."
"4837","tt0066817","6141","13","Add this to your Family Video Library."
"4838","tt0066817","6141","14","You will not be disappointed."
"4839","tt0066817","6142","1","Delightful Disney film with Angela Lansbury in fine form as a middle age spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in World War 11 England."
"4840","tt0066817","6142","2","Lansbury was about age 51 at the time of the film and she is just ideal for the part."
"4841","tt0066817","6142","3","She is Jessica Fletcher again but this time it's for the benefit or children and for mother England during a time of great peril."
"4842","tt0066817","6142","4","The film follows the adventures of Miss Price Lansbury and David Tomlinson as the professor of witchcraft in trying to obtain certain information on sorcery."
"4843","tt0066817","6142","5","Those 3 little darlings sent to live with Price to escape the London bombings are just wonderful in this enchanting film for all of us regardless of age."
"4844","tt0066817","6142","6","Too bad that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe are given so little to do in this endearing film."
"4845","tt0066817","6142","7","I really thought of the Ben Stiller film ""Night at the Museum,"" at the end of the film when the relics come to life to do battle with the Nazi invasion in the small British coastal town."
"4846","tt0066817","6143","1","Never viewed this 1971 film and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations."
"4847","tt0066817","6143","2","Angela Lansbury, Eglantine Price played an outstanding role as a woman who had taken a course in witch craft and was an apprentice who was beginning to fly on a broomstick and had quite a few difficulties taking off."
"4848","tt0066817","6143","3","Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed travel to different parts of the world."
"4849","tt0066817","6143","4","However, Eglantine missed her final exams to becoming an accomplished witch."
"4850","tt0066817","6143","5","Mr."
"4851","tt0066817","6143","6","Emerlius Browne, David Tomlinson was the person who sold Eglantine this course in witchcraft and he tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution."
"4852","tt0066817","6143","7","Eglantine has a purpose to her madness and that is to stop the Nazi's from evading England."
"4853","tt0066817","6143","8","Great family entertainment and we need more films like this today."
"4854","tt0066817","6144","1","I saw this when on The Wonderful World of Disney as a kid, so I didn't recall much of it."
"4855","tt0066817","6144","2","As I watched it recently, I sat there thinking, ""This is the weirdest thing I've seen""."
"4856","tt0066817","6144","3","The 'traveling' scenes look like something caused by an LSD overdose."
"4857","tt0066817","6144","4","The animated characters are mostly oddly colored/voiced versions of Jungle Book and Robin Hood characters."
"4858","tt0066817","6144","5","Some not so Disney things I noticed: kids being threatened at knife point and prostitutesduring the Portobello Road song."
"4859","tt0066817","6144","6","It was very entertaining, though the musical numbers were long and I can see little kids getting bored with them."
"4860","tt0066817","6144","7","Also, the subject manner was a bit dark, seeing as it was set during WW2."
"4861","tt0066817","6145","1","Mary Poppins is definitely much better, but this is a lovely film nonetheless."
"4862","tt0066817","6145","2","Angela Lansbury is splendidly dotty as Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson has great fun as Mr."
"4863","tt0066817","6145","3","Brown."
"4864","tt0066817","6145","4","Their chemistry was just brilliant as well."
"4865","tt0066817","6145","5","The children, however just lacked the same sparkle, though Paul is very funny and cute."
"4866","tt0066817","6145","6","The songs were actually not as bad as some people say, ""Beautiful Briny Sea"" is the best, in fact all the songs are outstanding."
"4867","tt0066817","6145","7","The special effects were wonderful, that had plenty of magic, and the story is original enough."
"4868","tt0066817","6145","8","The highlights, though, like Mary Poppins, were the animated sequences."
"4869","tt0066817","6145","9","The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favourite was the football match, which was absolutely hilarious."
"4870","tt0066817","6145","10","The only other criticism was that I didn't quite get the ending when I first saw it."
"4871","tt0066817","6145","11","All in all, a lovely film, that is hardly ever on."
"4872","tt0066817","6145","12","8/10 Bethany Cox"
"4873","tt0066817","6146","1","Perhaps Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins but this is a very different story and while Angela is delightful she was a very different performer to the great Julie Andrews."
"4874","tt0066817","6146","2","Having said that Lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance."
"4875","tt0066817","6146","3","There is something deliciously dotty about her character and she is given wonderful support by David Tomlinson."
"4876","tt0066817","6146","4","Tomilinson can carry a tune but he is certainly not much chop as a singer."
"4877","tt0066817","6146","5","It does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice."
"4878","tt0066817","6146","6","There are some great cameos from much loved stars of another time like Roddy McDowel who gives a winning performance and the much loved Tessie OShea who does very little but its nice to see the old gal again."
"4879","tt0066817","6146","7","Its also lovely to see Sam Jaffe and the king of English television Bruce Forsythe in small roles."
"4880","tt0066817","6146","8","The score has a couple of beautiful songs especially The briny sea and The age of Not Believing."
"4881","tt0066817","6146","9","The big number Portabello Road is stretched to the limit but it has plenty of theatricality."
"4882","tt0066817","6146","10","The effects look a bit cliché today but the scene with the German invaders being attacked by the wildest army in film is pretty impressive."
"4883","tt0066817","6146","11","The kids are not as annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying."
"4884","tt0066817","6146","12","I loved the marching song of the home army."
"4885","tt0066817","6146","13","The home guard were very important to Britain and this is a warm tribute."
"4886","tt0066817","6146","14","The animation is delightful, much better than Pixar which I find grotesque."
"4887","tt0066817","6146","15","A warm happy film and its a wonder its not done on stage."
"4888","tt0066817","6147","1","Okay, this film is about Bedknobs and Broomsticks, it's one of the most charming, delightful movies you'll ever see as a kid."
"4889","tt0066817","6147","2","It's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two spunky kids on an adventure for fun."
"4890","tt0066817","6147","3","It may be a little deniable to watch, but try it, I neither my mother didn't think it was bad, I was very enthused with the movie and the animation, they were all quite good."
"4891","tt0066817","6147","4","It is a delightfully wondrous comedy for the whole family to enjoy; even the kids."
"4892","tt0066817","6147","5","Ages 7 years and up will enjoy this wonderful, musical comedy with you and your family especially the animation."
"4893","tt0066817","6147","6","The animation movements and layouts are really nice and deserve a thumbs up."
"4894","tt0066817","6147","7","It's a terrifically good musical for the whole family so what are you waiting for."
"4895","tt0066817","6147","8","Go to the video store and rent Bedknobs and Broomsticks NOW."
"4896","tt0066817","6148","1","IN LOVING MEMORY OF DAVID TOMLINSON 1917 2000When I watched this movie for the first time I was 4 years old and I got fascinated by this story of witches in the 2nd World War."
"4897","tt0066817","6148","2","The scene, which impressed me the most, was the fight between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army."
"4898","tt0066817","6148","3","It was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the astonished singing their march."
"4899","tt0066817","6148","4","This movie is fantastic, from the trip to Portobello Road which became to me the most fantastic place of London to the journey to Naboomboo."
"4900","tt0066817","6148","5","Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple."
"4901","tt0066817","6148","6","She is always great, it seems the good aunt of a family and David with his always astonished face is her great co protagonist. we'll miss him a lot."
"4902","tt0066817","6149","1","I've just purchased the restored version of a film that I remember with much affection from childhood and it's certainly made for a curious afternoon's entertainment."
"4903","tt0066817","6149","2","Bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its complete form, the deleted scenes especially those with McDowall link events together quite neatly."
"4904","tt0066817","6149","3","What is a little disconcerting is the way the scenes have been remastered."
"4905","tt0066817","6149","4","Clearly, the soundtrack to this footage had been lost or damaged, so some bright spark at Disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogue."
"4906","tt0066817","6149","5","Which would have been great except that half the cast weren't around to do it some for better reasons than others and the whole thing has a rather shoddy quality to it."
"4907","tt0066817","6149","6","Some of the lip synching is pretty poor, and David Tomlinson's voice has been dubbed by a bloke who sounds absolutely nothing like David Tomlinson there's actually a hint of German in it, I think."
"4908","tt0066817","6149","7","However, good to hear the full versions of all the songs although 'Step in the right Direction' is still absent and the moments of magic in this film still shine through."
"4909","tt0066817","6149","8","And I challenge you not to giggle when young Paul gazes so innocently at Angela Lansbury and coos ""but what's that got to do with my knob.."""
"4910","tt0066817","6150","1","I have personally seen many Disney movies in my lifetime, though absolutely none of them match up in any way to Bedknobs and Broomsticks."
"4911","tt0066817","6150","2","Although I personally wouldn't have crossed live action with animation, it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters."
"4912","tt0066817","6150","3","The movie pits three evacuees from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country."
"4913","tt0066817","6150","4","I would have to say that the casting was brilliant."
"4914","tt0066817","6150","5","Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest."
"4915","tt0066817","6150","6","Endings always surprise me and this was no exception."
"4916","tt0066817","6150","7","It was neither happy nor sad, though I do not know if this was intentional."
"4917","tt0066817","6150","8","The dialog wasn't great, but considering it was designed to be a kid's movie, that is alright."
"4918","tt0066817","6150","9","Overall, I would give the performance nine out of ten, the dialog six out of ten, the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten."
"4919","tt0066817","6151","1","I will always have a soft spot for this Disney flick, another of their part live action/part animation entries that sought to recreate the success of ""Mary Poppins"" and never quite made it."
"4920","tt0066817","6151","2","When I was in grade school, every once in a while we would have a movie day, where the whole school would crowd into the cafeteria, and a movie would be projected the old fashioned way, multiple reels and all."
"4921","tt0066817","6151","3","At the time, it seemed like a momentous occasion whenever this day arrived, and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is one of the movies I can remember seeing this way."
"4922","tt0066817","6151","4","And from what I remember, it's quite charming."
"4923","tt0066817","6151","5","Angela Lansbury never put her name to anything that wasn't at least competent, and she's winning here as a witch with a magic bed boy, that could be misconstrued, couldn't it. who can take her and a couple of young kids on magic adventures to far off places."
"4924","tt0066817","6151","6","Come on, what kid wouldn't want a bed like that."
"4925","tt0066817","6151","7","Grade: A"
"4926","tt0066817","6152","1","Fabulous, fantastic, probably Disney's best musical adventure."
"4927","tt0066817","6152","2","I have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative, clever and fun."
"4928","tt0066817","6152","3","Even despite the silly ""flying bed"" scenes, the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny."
"4929","tt0066817","6152","4","Could they have picked anyone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine."
"4930","tt0066817","6152","5","I cannot think of anyone more suited to the role."
"4931","tt0066817","6152","6","Remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking Mary Poppins."
"4932","tt0066817","6152","7","David Tomlinson, though he had few quality movie roles, absolutely shines in this adventure."
"4933","tt0066817","6152","8","He was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays."
"4934","tt0066817","6152","9","Blustering, prim and proper Englishman nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does."
"4935","tt0066817","6152","10","It would be tragic to remake this film because Tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justice."
"4936","tt0066817","6152","11","The dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just don't capture."
"4937","tt0066817","6152","12","I particularly enjoy the parts where the Germans invade Eglantine's house and she must defend it in any way she can."
"4938","tt0066817","6152","13","Bobbing along, bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny, sea."
"4939","tt0066817","6152","14","Richard and Robert Sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers."
"4940","tt0066817","6152","15","All of them are fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road being one of my favorites."
"4941","tt0066817","6152","16","A great film that still holds up today!!"
"4942","tt0066817","6153","1","The obvious parallels between Walt Disney's charming fantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S."
"4943","tt0066817","6153","2","Lewis Chronicles of Narnia are pretty apparent."
"4944","tt0066817","6153","3","There are more coincidences here than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks than with Mary Poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two Disney films."
"4945","tt0066817","6153","4","Like The Chronicles of Narnia it involves some English children leaving London during the blitz and coming to live in the country."
"4946","tt0066817","6153","5","And those kids have to deal with a world of magic."
"4947","tt0066817","6153","6","But unlike C.S."
"4948","tt0066817","6153","7","Lewis the Rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now."
"4949","tt0066817","6153","8","No retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the Pevensie kids."
"4950","tt0066817","6153","9","No heavy duty philosophy here from Walt Disney except maybe it's not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like Angela Lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like David Tomlinson."
"4951","tt0066817","6153","10","Ms."
"4952","tt0066817","6153","11","Lansbury didn't get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing."
"4953","tt0066817","6153","12","She carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at Disney couldn't top."
"4954","tt0066817","6153","13","And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that department for this film."
"4955","tt0066817","6153","14","Two performers made their farewell to films in Bedknobs and Broomsticks."
"4956","tt0066817","6153","15","Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film, she graced many a film in the United Kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers."
"4957","tt0066817","6153","16","And that grand character actor Reginald Owen as the retired general who leads the Old Home Guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the world."
"4958","tt0066817","6153","17","The team of Robert B."
"4959","tt0066817","6153","18","Sherman and Richard M."
"4960","tt0066817","6153","19","Sherman who wrote the score for Mary Poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here."
"4961","tt0066817","6153","20","The Age Of Not Believing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the Theme from Shaft."
"4962","tt0066817","6153","21","Personally though I do like David Tomlinson's tribute to that most colorful of London streets, Portabello Road."
"4963","tt0066817","6153","22","Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years."
"4964","tt0066817","6153","23","Imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics."
"4965","tt0066817","6154","1","I was lucky enough to catch this film finally on Turner Classic films tonight, as it is one of the films that won an Oscar for special effects in their yearly month of Oscar winning films."
"4966","tt0066817","6154","2","BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS is easily a sequel film for the earlier success of MARY POPPINS."
"4967","tt0066817","6154","3","That film too was a big success, and an Oscar winner Best Actress for Julie Andrews."
"4968","tt0066817","6154","4","Like MARY POPPINS BEDKNOBS has David Tomlinson in it, in a role wherein he learns about parenting."
"4969","tt0066817","6154","5","It is a fine mixture of live action and animation."
"4970","tt0066817","6154","6","It is set in a past period of British history if not the Edwardian Georgian world of 1912 London, it is England's coastline during the ""Dunkirk"" Summer of 1940."
"4971","tt0066817","6154","7","It even has old Reginald Owen in it, here as a General in the Home Guard, whereas formerly he was Admiral Boom in MARY POPPINS."
"4972","tt0066817","6154","8","Ironically it was Owen's final role."
"4973","tt0066817","6154","9","The Home Guard sequences not too many in the film reminds one of the British series DAD'S ARMY, dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war."
"4974","tt0066817","6154","10","The period is also well suggested by the appearance of the three Rawlins children as war orphans from the bombings in the Blitz in London."
"4975","tt0066817","6154","11","And in typical Disney fashion in the musical number ""Portobello Road"" different members of the British Army including soldiers from India and the Caribbean complete with metal drums yet!"
"4976","tt0066817","6154","12","appear with Scottish and local female auxiliaries in costume."
"4977","tt0066817","6154","13","All of which, surprisingly, is a plus."
"4978","tt0066817","6154","14","But the biggest plus is that for Angela Lansbury, her performance as Eglantine Price is finally it: her sole real musical film lead."
"4979","tt0066817","6154","15","In a noteworthy acting career, Lansbury never got the real career musical role she deserved as Auntie Mame in the musical MAME that came out shortly after BEDKNOBS did."
"4980","tt0066817","6154","16","She had been in singing parts in GASLIGHT with her brief UP IN A BALLOON BOYS, and in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY with LITTLE YELLOW BIRD, and best of all in support and in conclusion of THE HARVEY GIRLS with the final reprise of ON THE ATCHISON, TOPEKA, AND THE SANTA FE."
"4981","tt0066817","6154","17","But only here does she play the female lead."
"4982","tt0066817","6154","18","So when you hear her singing with David Tomlinson you may be able to understand what we lost when she did not play Mame Dennis Burnside."
"4983","tt0066817","6154","19","The rest of the cast is pretty good, Tomlinson here learning that he can rise to the occasion after a lifetime of relative failure."
"4984","tt0066817","6154","20","The three children Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart, and Ian Weighill actually showing more interesting sides in their characters than their Edwardian predecessors in POPPINS Weighill in particular, as something of a budding opportunist thinking of blackmailing Lansbury after finding out she is a witch."
"4985","tt0066817","6154","21","The only surprising waste possibly due to cutting of scenes is Roddy McDowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the film."
"4986","tt0066817","6154","22","With his possible role as a disapproving foe of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part."
"4987","tt0066817","6154","23","Also of note is John Ericson, as the German officer who leads a raid at the conclusion of the film, only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the British countryside, and Sam Jaffe as a competitor for the magic formula that Lansbury and Tomlinson are seeking."
"4988","tt0066817","6154","24","As for the animation, the two sequences under the sea in a lagoon, and at the wildest soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view, with Tomlinson pulled into the latter as the referee, and getting pretty badly banged up in various charges and scrimmages."
"4989","tt0066817","6154","25","As I said it is a pretty fine sample of the Disney studio's best work."
"4990","tt0066817","6155","1","""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, despite not being one of the best Disney works."
"4991","tt0066817","6155","2","It has a generally good story, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and delightful special effects, good settings and lovely landscapes of England."
"4992","tt0066817","6155","3","It also combines very well live action and animation."
"4993","tt0066817","6155","4","The animation itself is, of course, pretty good."
"4994","tt0066817","6155","5","The animation resembles very much that of the 1973 animated film ""Robin Hood"" and the same can be said about the animated characters: there are plenty of wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like in ""Robin Hood""."
"4995","tt0066817","6155","6","Besides, the King a lion seems to be a mix of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear does look like Little John."
"4996","tt0066817","6155","7","This movie is often compared to ""Mary Poppins"" with a reason."
"4997","tt0066817","6155","8","Both combine live action and animation with a similar artwork."
"4998","tt0066817","6155","9","Both have similar settings in London."
"4999","tt0066817","6155","10","Both have their own magic and a magical woman."
"5000","tt0066817","6155","11","The kids Carrie, Charlie and cute little Paul are a bit like the Banks children."
"5001","tt0066817","6155","12","Both movies were directed by Robert Stevenson and both cast David Tomlinson."
"5002","tt0066817","6155","13","However, instead of a very serious man like George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a merrier and magical man Professor Emelius Browne."
"5003","tt0066817","6155","14","With its magic, this movie has also some slight but significant similarities to Harry Potter's stories."
"5004","tt0066817","6155","15","The majority of the songs are good."
"5005","tt0066817","6155","16","""The Age of Not Believing"" and ""The Beautiful Briny Sea"" are the very best."
"5006","tt0066817","6155","17","""Portobello Road"" is nice too."
"5007","tt0066817","6155","18","David Tomlinson is great in this film once again."
"5008","tt0066817","6155","19","Angela Lansbury is great as Miss Price and the 3 kid actors are all fine too: Cindy O'Callaghan as Carrie, Ian Weighill as Charlie a boy in «the age of not believing» and Roy Snart as the youngest brother Paul."
"5009","tt0066817","6155","20","I like the black cat."
"5010","tt0066817","6155","21","It's pretty cool."
"5011","tt0066817","6155","22","It looks a bit like Salem, the black cat from the TV series ""Sabrina, the teenage witch""."
"5012","tt0066817","6155","23","I find cute whenever one of the movie's characters is transformed into a white rabbit."
"5013","tt0066817","6155","24","Rabbits are really cute, fluffy and adorable animals."
"5014","tt0066817","6155","25","I just love them!"
"5015","tt0066817","6155","26","Even funnier is whenever Professor Emelius Browne is transformed into a white rabbit because, when he's transformed in human again, he shakes his nose like a rabbit."
"5016","tt0066817","6155","27","It's really hilarious, combined with his comical figure and that mustache."
"5017","tt0066817","6155","28","Overall, this is an okay movie, but its ending is quite bad."
"5018","tt0066817","6155","29","The first minutes of the movie are nothing special, but then it improves a lot."
"5019","tt0066817","6155","30","The ending, however, is weak."
"5020","tt0066817","6155","31","That's my major criticism about it, in great part because the animated knights thing is a little too much for me and also due to the war feeling."
"5021","tt0066817","6156","1","This movie has always been my favorit Disney movie."
"5022","tt0066817","6156","2","Then on 11/21/01 I saw the 30th aniversy of this movie DVD."
"5023","tt0066817","6156","3","WOW I remembered why I loved this movie."
"5024","tt0066817","6156","4","The DVD is So great, It has an extra 30 min that the original did not have."
"5025","tt0066817","6156","5","I did not know this when I first started watching."
"5026","tt0066817","6156","6","The movie made ever so much more since."
"5027","tt0066817","6156","7","The music they cut out should have been left in."
"5028","tt0066817","6156","8","You have not seen this movie until you have seen the Full 131 min version."
"5029","tt0066817","6156","9","A lot of people say that the music is forgettable."
"5030","tt0066817","6156","10","I remember every song in this movie by heart, every song has it's own Charm by it's self, and comes together as a hole."
"5031","tt0066817","6156","11","I remember when i was younger I had the ""Eglantine"" song stuck in my head for days at a time."
"5032","tt0066817","6156","12","As well as ""Briny Sea"" that song was meant for marry poppens but was cut out of the film Please Watch the new uncut 30th aniversy movie and re vote for this movie. the 10 that it really is."
"5033","tt0066817","6157","1","This is a movie I had never even thought of seeing until my 3 year old spotted it at the video store and grabbed it after liking the cover picture of the animals on Nabooboo Island."
"5034","tt0066817","6157","2","We got it and have watched it repeatedly since; in fact we've rented it several times since."
"5035","tt0066817","6157","3","There are very few non animated movies that my son will watch and pay attention to; what a nice change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid."
"5036","tt0066817","6157","4","The acting is outstanding, the songs are compelling, they get deep into your head and you can't help but singing along."
"5037","tt0066817","6157","5","The storyline, while specifically about WW2 is timeless in it's own way and there is something new to see every time you watch."
"5038","tt0066817","6157","6","I've heard it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two very different movies, both excellent, but somehow my son has no interest at all in Mary Poppins."
"5039","tt0066817","6157","7","This is one of those movies that kids will want to watch over and over again and one that parents won't mind complying with."
"5040","tt0066817","6157","8","There are days we watch it before nap time and bed time and I don't feel that groan coming that comes when he wants to repeat any other movie."
"5041","tt0066817","6158","1","What can i say about a tale such as this."
"5042","tt0066817","6158","2","This magical tale has followed me from my early childhood,evoking warm memories in my heart."
"5043","tt0066817","6158","3","The characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene."
"5044","tt0066817","6158","4","For example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore."
"5045","tt0066817","6158","5","I loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums."
"5046","tt0066817","6158","6","The story line was wonderful."
"5047","tt0066817","6158","7","I wanted so badly for Landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with Mr."
"5048","tt0066817","6158","8","Brown,and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war."
"5049","tt0066817","6158","9","I am still a child inside,and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other."
"5050","tt0066817","6158","10","This movie is my definite favorite of all times."
"5051","tt0066817","6158","11","I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away,and transported into another time."
"5052","tt0066817","6159","1","This place in England during 1940."
"5053","tt0066817","6159","2","Three orphans Carrie, Charles and Paul are sent to live with Miss Price Angela Lansbury."
"5054","tt0066817","6159","3","She doesn't want them but reluctantly takes them in."
"5055","tt0066817","6159","4","It seems she is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft."
"5056","tt0066817","6159","5","OK I realize this is a family film but College of Witchcraft..."
"5057","tt0066817","6159","6","Come ON!!"
"5058","tt0066817","6159","7","Before she can finish the course though the college is closed because of the war ... and she seeks down the head Professor Browne David Tomlinson."
"5059","tt0066817","6159","8","And her and the kids travel around on a bed with the help of a magical bedknob."
"5060","tt0066817","6159","9","I first saw this when I was 9 and vaguely remember loving it."
"5061","tt0066817","6159","10","It sure doesn't hold up as an adult!"
"5062","tt0066817","6159","11","The story is silly even for a fantasy, the kids are terrible actors and one of them Charles is incredibly obnoxious."
"5063","tt0066817","6159","12","Also Roddy McDowall is third billed and only appears in two short scenes!"
"5064","tt0066817","6159","13","There's also a trip to the Isle of Naboombu which is run by animated animals."
"5065","tt0066817","6159","14","I thought that might be fun but the animation is poor for Disney and it has a very violent and far too long soccer game between the animals."
"5066","tt0066817","6159","15","There are a few saving graces here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just great; the songs while forgettable are pleasant; the long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy and the Oscar winning special effects are still pretty impressive at the end."
"5067","tt0066817","6159","16","But the weak story line, poor animation and unlikable kids really pull this one down."
"5068","tt0066817","6159","17","I heard the extended version is even worse!"
"5069","tt0066817","6159","18","I can only give this a 7."
"5070","tt0066817","6160","1","SPOILER ALERT!!!!"
"5071","tt0066817","6160","2","I had just watched the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks."
"5072","tt0066817","6160","3","Though I did like the extended version, I wish they would have left the original version on the DVD.The Portabello Road could have been cut down to the orginal length."
"5073","tt0066817","6160","4","It was too long and dragged the movie along."
"5074","tt0066817","6160","5","Though the dancing is great, would have been much better left on the DVD as a Deleted Scene."
"5075","tt0066817","6160","6","All in all this is a great movie."
"5076","tt0066817","6160","7","My 5 year old liked it."
"5077","tt0066817","6160","8","And it is wonderful that movies that I enjoyed as a child are being passed on to a new generation."
"5078","tt0066817","6160","9","This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection."
"5079","tt0066817","6160","10","Just as I had remembered!"
"5080","tt0066817","6160","11","out of"
"5081","tt0066817","6161","1","Set during WWII, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun filled fantasy adventure for kids, starring Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch who, with the help of three evacuee children and a 'Professor of Witchcraft', thwarts a Nazi invasion."
"5082","tt0066817","6161","2","Brilliantly inventive, with loads of laughs, this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters, exciting story and catchy tunes."
"5083","tt0066817","6161","3","Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine, the not quite perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime, and her three young co stars Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill are equally impressive as the Cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty Hun."
"5084","tt0066817","6161","4","The special effects are somewhat dated, but let's face it, kids don't care too much about these things, so long as they are entertained."
"5085","tt0066817","6161","5","And entertained, they will be."
"5086","tt0066817","6161","6","With some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect, and more genuine movie magic than a hundred Harry Potters, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism."
"5087","tt0066817","6161","7","In fact, only a rather drawn out musical number set in Portobello Road mars the film's perfection, but with so much else to enjoy, that can easily be forgiven."
"5088","tt0066817","6161","8","And besides, any film featuring UK television legend Bruce Forsyth as a 'Flash' Harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me."
"5089","tt0066817","6162","1","I loved this masterpiece and quite frankly I, too found Mary Poppins although I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke to be silly and sacrine sweet."
"5090","tt0066817","6162","2","Angela Lansbury plays her character to perfection and I don't know why people think of this film as distorted."
"5091","tt0066817","6162","3","It was magical and it was lots of fun to watch."
"5092","tt0066817","6162","4","Every scene held a certain charm as you got to know the characters better."
"5093","tt0066817","6162","5","You truly see how this little thrown together family learn to bond with each other, despite their age and differences."
"5094","tt0066817","6162","6","I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles who was at ""The Age of not Believing""."
"5095","tt0066817","6162","7","Mary Poppins may be more popular and cherished by others but this little gem will be the one that I will always love and cherish."
"5096","tt0066817","6163","1","This is one of the few films where I consider the film rendition to be an improvement on the original book."
"5097","tt0066817","6163","2","The story is clear, accessible, amusing and interesting and the musical numbers are without a doubt exceptional."
"5098","tt0066817","6163","3","I adored the cyclical rendition of 'The old home guard' and the charming 'Portobello Road', a great combination of early animation + real actors techniques which, though dated do not detract from the charm of the piece."
