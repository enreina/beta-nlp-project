"1","tt0033045","2105","1","Set in World Depression Era Prague, this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters, only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop, who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague."
"2","tt0033045","2105","2","Add a little twist the owner is convinced that his favorite employee Stewart is having an affair with the owner's wife, leaving Stewart briefly 'fired', along with an admission that the sales girl 'liked' Stewart all along, the happy ending is inevitable."
"3","tt0033045","2105","3","Although VERY dated references to poverty and I have a wife and two kids to consider are over used, along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure, like a musical cigar box, are out of reach for common people's enjoyment, this film is much more effective and more credible than the 1990s re make ""You've Got Mail""."
"4","tt0033045","2105","4","In the re make starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the actual odds of the chain of events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended."""
"5","tt0033045","2105","5","Shop Around The Corner"" is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated, less hectic, and more romantic time and place known as a novelist's Utopia."
"6","tt0033045","2105","6","Lovers of Classic Romantic Comedies will enjoy this picture!"
"7","tt0033045","2106","1","Would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one."
"8","tt0033045","2106","2","I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement."
"9","tt0033045","2106","3","Margaret Sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought out the best in each other."
"10","tt0033045","2106","4","This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most winning performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot."
"11","tt0033045","2106","5","The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy."
"12","tt0033045","2106","6","Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a triumph."
"13","tt0033045","2106","7","With some of the wittiest dialogue American movies of the 30's has to offer."
"14","tt0033045","2107","1","I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other LaserDiscs from eBay."
"15","tt0033045","2107","2","Usually, I am into war and action movies but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies."
"16","tt0033045","2107","3","If you are bored by today's special FX films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out Shop Around the Corner on a quiet evening."
"17","tt0033045","2107","4","What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency."
"18","tt0033045","2107","5","There is nothing fake or pretentious about them."
"19","tt0033045","2107","6","Take Mr."
"20","tt0033045","2107","7","Matuschek for example: When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself."
"21","tt0033045","2107","8","Not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of Stewart."
"22","tt0033045","2107","9","OK, weired example."
"23","tt0033045","2107","10","Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable."
"24","tt0033045","2107","11","Yet still, I liked it a lot."
"25","tt0033045","2107","12","If you likes Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart."
"26","tt0033045","2108","1","A warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it."
"27","tt0033045","2108","2","The key to this film's success is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low key, unfussy performances."
"28","tt0033045","2108","3","As a result, you fall in love with virtually all of them."
"29","tt0033045","2108","4","There's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which I appreciated."
"30","tt0033045","2108","5","Loneliness is a major theme, most obviously represented in the character of the shop's owner and manager, played wonderfully by Frank Morgan."
"31","tt0033045","2108","6","He discovers that he's being cuckolded by his wife, and realizes that the successful life he's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it."
"32","tt0033045","2108","7","This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant, because they're both reaching out to this unseen other, who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met."
"33","tt0033045","2108","8","Of course we know everything will turn out right in the end, but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy."
"34","tt0033045","2108","9","Lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry."
"35","tt0033045","2108","10","The little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family, and that's exactly how it feels to us as well."
"36","tt0033045","2108","11","This is a wonderful, unsung romance."
"37","tt0033045","2108","12","Grade: A+"
"38","tt0033045","2109","1","I have passed several times on watching this since I figured it was some dumb, sappy, dated romantic comedy."
"39","tt0033045","2109","2","Well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated."
"40","tt0033045","2109","3","However, it is not overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness."
"41","tt0033045","2109","4","You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out quite as you had expected."
"42","tt0033045","2109","5","But, there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic."
"43","tt0033045","2109","6","If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them."
"44","tt0033045","2110","1","So much has been written about the film's plot, the wonderful acting performance, the script, the melancholy, bittersweet atmosphere, the superb direction what can I add."
"45","tt0033045","2110","2","Just watch for one of the most heart warming, beautifully acted, poignant scenes ever filmed."
"46","tt0033045","2110","3","It is Christmas eve and Frank Morgan's character the owner of the shop Mr."
"47","tt0033045","2110","4","Matuschekis recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt."
"48","tt0033045","2110","5","As each of his employees leave he invites them to a Christmas dinner."
"49","tt0033045","2110","6","Each and everyone of them politely turn him down."
"50","tt0033045","2110","7","They all have plans for their own Christmas eve."
"51","tt0033045","2110","8","At this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene."
"52","tt0033045","2110","9","Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears."
"53","tt0033045","2110","10","Thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene."
"54","tt0033045","2110","11","The new employee, the errand boy, is the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snowy street scene."
"55","tt0033045","2110","12","Desperately Mr."
"56","tt0033045","2110","13","Matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him, he will treat him to all the wonderful Christmas food that this errand boy has probably never seen!"
"57","tt0033045","2110","14","The chap is overwhelmed, he too is obviously as lonely as Mr."
"58","tt0033045","2110","15","Matuschek and together they can have a wonderful Christmas meal."
"59","tt0033045","2110","16","Every time I see this scene it moves me."
"60","tt0033045","2110","17","If you manage to get the delightful DVD look at the great trailer with Frank Morgan introducing himself as Mr."
"61","tt0033045","2110","18","Matuschek and an appearance by the director of the film the talented Ernst Lubitsch."
"62","tt0033045","2110","19","This film is a joy from beginning to end."
"63","tt0033045","2111","1","'The Shop Around the Corner 1940' is a pleasant romantic comedy, not the sort that I will hold dear to me until the end of my days, but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation."
"64","tt0033045","2111","2","By 1940, director Ernst Lubitsch had long ago taken Hollywood by storm, and his famed ""Lubitsch touch"" had become a sparkling commercial trademark."
"65","tt0033045","2111","3","This film was planned for a 1939 release, but scheduling conflicts meant that James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were unavailable for filming."
"66","tt0033045","2111","4","Rather than substituting either of his main stars, Lubitsch decided to postpone production, in the meantime directing Greta Garbo in 'Ninotchka 1939.'"
"67","tt0033045","2111","5","When it was finally completed, 'The Shop Around the Corner' appears to have been met with relative indifference, receiving zero Oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by Samson Raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and Frank Morgan in a supporting role."
"68","tt0033045","2111","6","Time, nevertheless, has betrayed the film's massive and enduring influence, with high profile remakes including 'In the Good Old Summertime 1949' and 'You've Got Mail 1998.'"
"69","tt0033045","2111","7","At its surface, one might assume 'The Shop Around the Corner' to simply be the story of two lovers, Klara Novak Sullavan and Alfred Kralik Stewart, who love each other without knowing it."
"70","tt0033045","2111","8","However, Lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that."
"71","tt0033045","2111","9","It's the story of Matuschek and Company, a stylish gift shop in Budapest, and the various human relationships that make the store such a close knit family."
"72","tt0033045","2111","10","When store owner Hugo Matuschek Frank Morgan begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife, we witness the breakdown of two families, both at home and at work."
"73","tt0033045","2111","11","There's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the United States  perhaps in the blustery streets of New York  but Lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in Europe, the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep."
"74","tt0033045","2111","12","This subtle subtext brings a more meaningful, personal touch to the film  in fact, even as I write this review, I'm beginning to appreciate the story even more."
"75","tt0033045","2111","13","Sullavan and Stewart are both lovely in their respective roles, but I think that it's the supporting cast that really make the film."
"76","tt0033045","2111","14","Each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix, and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable."
"77","tt0033045","2111","15","I especially liked how Lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards Hugo Matuschek, who, in any other film, would have been restricted to an underdeveloped, two dimensional portrayal."
"78","tt0033045","2111","16","Matuschek may have lost the love of his family, but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees, and you feel a heartwarming glow when, in the bitter cold of a Christmas Eve snowstorm, he finds companionship in a freckle faced young errand boy Charles Smith."
"79","tt0033045","2111","17","This genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of Billy Wilder's later creations, for example, Boom Boom Jackson in 'The Fortune Cookie 1966' or Carlo Carlucci in 'Avanti!"
"80","tt0033045","2111","18","1972.'"
"81","tt0033045","2111","19","Of course, it doesn't really need saying, but Billy Wilder learned from the best."
"82","tt0033045","2112","1","In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan as Klara Novak gets a job as clerk in a gift shop; there, she bickers with co worker James Stewart as Alfred Kralik."
"83","tt0033045","2112","2","The two don't get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal."
"84","tt0033045","2112","3","Watching Ernst Lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying."
"85","tt0033045","2112","4","Even better is a sub plot involving shop owner Frank Morgan as Hugo Matuschek, who suspects his wife is having an affair."
"86","tt0033045","2112","5","Hiring a private detective, Mr."
"87","tt0033045","2112","6","Morgan confirms his wife of 22 years is having sex with one of his younger employees."
"88","tt0033045","2112","7","Morgan, painfully realizing, ""She just didn't want to grow old with me,"" and the supporting characters are what keeps this film from getting old."
"89","tt0033045","2112","8","The Shop Around the Corner 1/12/40 Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut"
"90","tt0033045","2113","1","The location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film, Balta Street in Budapest but it could really be in any place."
"91","tt0033045","2113","2","The small number of sets reflect a middle European design but it could be a shop around any corner."
"92","tt0033045","2113","3","The film is not about Budapest or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love, reflected in most of the main characters."
"93","tt0033045","2113","4","Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance, and the story unwinds to bring these two aspects together beautifully."
"94","tt0033045","2113","5","Hugo Matuschek, the owner of the shop, is having trouble with his wife, she only a voice at the end of the phone."
"95","tt0033045","2113","6","Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair."
"96","tt0033045","2113","7","Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments."
"97","tt0033045","2113","8","Mr Pirovitch's life is centred around his wife and children."
"98","tt0033045","2113","9","Pepi Katona 'plays Santa Claus' to a girl at Christmas."
"99","tt0033045","2113","10","You even sense that quiet Flora Katchuck, while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone."
"100","tt0033045","2113","11","The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama."
"101","tt0033045","2113","12","It moves effortlessly from scene to scene."
"102","tt0033045","2113","13","It is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again, simple yet profound."
"103","tt0033045","2113","14","The dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days."
"104","tt0033045","2113","15","All the acting is magnificent."
"105","tt0033045","2113","16","Even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect."
"106","tt0033045","2113","17","James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other perfectly."
"107","tt0033045","2113","18","He was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance."
"108","tt0033045","2113","19","Margaret Sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days."
"109","tt0033045","2113","20","Some of her other films are worth catching."
"110","tt0033045","2113","21","As Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing."
"111","tt0033045","2113","22","His moment of truth is very moving."
"112","tt0033045","2113","23","Gold stars all round to the performers."
"113","tt0033045","2113","24","It is a well worn phrase that they don't make them like they used to The vague re make 'You've Got Mail' was dire but in this case it is true."
"114","tt0033045","2113","25","The director Lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity."
"115","tt0033045","2114","1","Two warring shop workers in a leather goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box number aliases."
"116","tt0033045","2114","2","Within this simple idea and an everyday setting, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit, drama, poignancy and irony that never lets up."
"117","tt0033045","2114","3","Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well developed characters have their own sub plots and in jokes."
"118","tt0033045","2114","4","Although wrongly eclipsed by Stewart's big films of 39/40 Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr Smith this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlties unseen in the other films."
"119","tt0033045","2115","1","After seeing You've Got Mail and feeling disappointed, I decided to see the original movie which inspired this one, The Shop Around the Corner."
"120","tt0033045","2115","2","I was amazed at this movie."
"121","tt0033045","2115","3","It's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times."
"122","tt0033045","2115","4","The acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, that if you haven't seen it, I wish to urge you to see it today."
"123","tt0033045","2115","5","I'm not against re makes and sometimes I like the new version more than the original one, but this time have to admit that You've Got Mail is a poor adaption of this classic."
"124","tt0033045","2115","6","Don't miss it, go to your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!"
"125","tt0033045","2116","1","Has there ever been a movie more charming than this."
"126","tt0033045","2116","2","One of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives."
"127","tt0033045","2116","3","The center of it is the ""romance"" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals."
"128","tt0033045","2116","4","But there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including ""You've Got Mail"", the recent update of ""Shop"" they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs."
"129","tt0033045","2116","5","Everyone gets to be an intricate part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm."
"130","tt0033045","2116","6","One of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near tragic Frank Morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have Christmas dinner with."
"131","tt0033045","2116","7","A must see!"
"132","tt0033045","2116","8","out of"
"133","tt0033045","2117","1","Every time I watch this movie I am more impressed by the whole production."
"134","tt0033045","2117","2","I have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made."
"135","tt0033045","2117","3","Everyone involved is perfect; script, acting, direction, sets and editing."
"136","tt0033045","2117","4","Whilst James Stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance, and the supporting cast are magnificent, it is Margaret Sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was."
"137","tt0033045","2117","5","Her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve."
"138","tt0033045","2117","6","Lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best."
"139","tt0033045","2117","7","Watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take breathtaking."
"140","tt0033045","2118","1","THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is one of the sweetest and most feel good romantic comedies ever made."
"141","tt0033045","2118","2","There's just no getting around that, and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words."
"142","tt0033045","2118","3","It's not one of those films that tries too hard, nor does it come up with the oddest possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end."
"143","tt0033045","2118","4","In fact, all its charm is innate, contained within the characters and the setting and the plot... which is highly believable to boot."
"144","tt0033045","2118","5","It's easy to think that such a love story, as beautiful as any other ever told, could happen to you... a feeling you don't often get from other romantic comedies, however sweet and heart warming they may be."
"145","tt0033045","2118","6","Alfred Kralik James Stewart and Clara Novak Margaret Sullavan don't have the most auspicious of first meetings when she arrives in the shop Matuschek & Co. he's been working in for the past nine years, asking for a job."
"146","tt0033045","2118","7","They clash from the very beginning, mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it's opened he thinks it's a ludicrous idea; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired."
"147","tt0033045","2118","8","Their bickering takes them through the next six months, even as they both unconsciously, of course!"
"148","tt0033045","2118","9","fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through PO Box 237."
"149","tt0033045","2118","10","This would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on, except that THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is expertly fleshed out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters, from the fatherly but lonely Hugo Matuschek Frank Morgan himself, who learns that his shop really is his home; Pirovitch Felix Bressart, Kralik's sidekick and friend who always skitters out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion; smarmy pimp du jour Vadas Joseph Schildkraut who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous Kralik; and ambitious errand boy Pepi Katona William Tracy who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for Matuschek & Co."
"150","tt0033045","2118","11","The unpretentious love story between 'Dear Friends' is played out in this little shop in Budapest, Hungary, in which Kralik's unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirds to be along."
"151","tt0033045","2118","12","It's nice that everyone gets a story in this film; the supporting characters are well developed, and Matuschek's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one Alfred and Clara share."
"152","tt0033045","2118","13","His invitation to new errand boy Rudy Charles Smith for Christmas Eve dinner, made in the whirling, beautiful snow of a Hungarian winter, makes the audience glad that he is not alone; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it isn't this film's business to tell."
"153","tt0033045","2118","14","Aside from the love story, I must say that James Stewart is truly one of the best things about this film."
"154","tt0033045","2118","15","He doesn't play the full fledged Jimmy Stewart persona in this film c/f 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' for that; in fact Alfred Kralik is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind."
"155","tt0033045","2118","16","He's rather a brusque man, in fact, with little hint until, perhaps, the very end of the aw shucks down home boyish charm Stewart would soon come to patent."
"156","tt0033045","2118","17","When he finds out before Clara that they have been corresponding in secret, in fact, Kralik doesn't 'fess up he waits it out to see how far he can take the charade, especially since he quickly realises given his stormy relationship with Clara as boss and underling that loving the person he knows through the exchanged letters might not equate with loving the person herself."
"157","tt0033045","2118","18","His description to Clara of the fictional Matthias Popkin what a name!"
"158","tt0033045","2118","19","who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme, but also his way of proving that the letters don't reveal all there is to a man, just as her letters don't reveal all there is to her."
"159","tt0033045","2118","20","Stewart plays this role perfectly he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever Clara insults Mr."
"160","tt0033045","2118","21","Kralik, as she is often wont to do, even and especially to his face."
"161","tt0033045","2118","22","And yet one believes, underneath the brusqueness and professionalism, that he could reveal his identity with as much earnestness and sincerity and sheer hope as he eventually does."
"162","tt0033045","2118","23","Special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well."
"163","tt0033045","2118","24","Margaret Sullavan fares rather less well in the first half of the film, but she really comes into her own in the closing shop scene on Christmas Eve, when she almost gets her heart broken again by Alfred's most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart."
"164","tt0033045","2118","25","Frank Morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous Hugo Matuschek driven to nervous breakdown, the man who has to rediscover his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to 'grow old with him'."
"165","tt0033045","2118","26","And Felix Bressart plays the role of the meek but loyal Pirovitch wonderfully a Lubitsch regular, since he appears as a hilarious Russian ambassador in NINOTCHKA of particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend Alfred get the Christmas present the latter really wants... a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box Clara is so hung up on."
"166","tt0033045","2118","27","Ernst Lubitsch really does himself proud with this film for example, the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the Matuschek shop is well worth the effort, right down to the Hungarian names on the door, the wares and the cash register and so on."
"167","tt0033045","2118","28","But even though Lubitsch chose to have the story set in Hungary, the setting is actually universal: it could happen anywhere; it could happen to you."
"168","tt0033045","2118","29","Therein lies the charm of this simple story, these believable characters who really are people."
"169","tt0033045","2118","30","The snow on Christmas Eve is real as well, or at least as real as Lubitsch could make it he had snow machines brought in at great expense."
"170","tt0033045","2118","31","It is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable, that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be replicated."
"171","tt0033045","2118","32","No, not even in a remake like YOU'VE GOT MAIL."
"172","tt0033045","2118","33","This is really the Jimmy Stewart Christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE."
"173","tt0033045","2118","34","Not to detract from the merits of that other film, but there'd be no harm, and in fact a lot of good, done in watching THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER this Christmas instead."
"174","tt0033045","2118","35","It's sweet, funny, charming, and Stewart is impeccable in his role."
"175","tt0033045","2118","36","We should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could."
"176","tt0033045","2119","1","""The Shop Around the Corner"" is one of the great films from director Ernst Lubitsch."
"177","tt0033045","2119","2","In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it's filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart ."
"178","tt0033045","2119","3","They're the type of character actors that Hollywood sadly no longer employs."
"179","tt0033045","2119","4","In fact, the film itself is the kind of movie that Hollywood doesn't make anymore."
"180","tt0033045","2119","5","The makers of ""You've Got Mail"" claim their film to be a remake, but that's just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise."
"181","tt0033045","2119","6","Anyway, if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940's, you'll find ""The Shop Around the Corner"" to be nothing short of wonderful."
"182","tt0033045","2119","7","Just as good with repeat viewings."
"183","tt0033045","2119","8","Enjoy!"
"184","tt0033045","2120","1","James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co workers in a Budapest gift shop who don't really like each other, not knowing they're really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meet."
"185","tt0033045","2120","2","A very charming romantic comedy, very engagingly played by it's two likable stars and a very eager to please supporting cast."
"186","tt0033045","2120","3","The story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence don't quite know how to explain it that films today just don't have."
"187","tt0033045","2120","4","This can obviously be compared to the recent You've Got Mail, and the original wins in every way."
"188","tt0033045","2120","5","This is mandatory viewing each Christmas, I can't think of a better way to jumpstart a Christmas feel than this little gem."
"189","tt0033045","2121","1","This is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players."
"190","tt0033045","2121","2","It will make you laugh and it will make you cry."
"191","tt0033045","2121","3","The very end of the movie gets me to mist up every time."
"192","tt0033045","2121","4","If you want to see a great movie, this is it."
"193","tt0033045","2121","5","Jimmy Stewert supplies a wonderfully witty performance and Frank Morgan as Mr."
"194","tt0033045","2121","6","Matuschek is spellbinding."
"195","tt0033045","2121","7","Morgan's diversity of character is nothing short of amazing."
"196","tt0033045","2121","8","William Tracy as Pepi is terrific comic relief and delivers some of the movies most important lines and performances."
"197","tt0033045","2121","9","Felix Bressart delivers a fantastic performance as Perovitch, a stumbling bumbling shop worker who's life's ambition is to please those he works with."
"198","tt0033045","2121","10","It is a simple story of how close co workers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances."
"199","tt0033045","2122","1","Back in the day of the big studio system, the darndest casting decisions were made."
"200","tt0033045","2122","2","Good old all American James Stewart appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner."
"201","tt0033045","2122","3","Had I been casting the film, the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer."
"202","tt0033045","2122","4","His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing."
"203","tt0033045","2122","5","Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan."
"204","tt0033045","2122","6","Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her."
"205","tt0033045","2122","7","But is only this one where neither of them dies."
"206","tt0033045","2122","8","Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in New York."
"207","tt0033045","2122","9","In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then."
"208","tt0033045","2122","10","I think only Clark Gable was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty."
"209","tt0033045","2122","11","Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out."
"210","tt0033045","2122","12","But if you can accept Stewart, than you'll be seeing a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch."
"211","tt0033045","2122","13","The plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest don't get along in person."
"212","tt0033045","2122","14","But it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other."
"213","tt0033045","2122","15","Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife."
"214","tt0033045","2122","16","Though the leads are fine and Frank Morgan departs from his usual befuddled self, the two players who come off best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut."
"215","tt0033045","2122","17","Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions."
"216","tt0033045","2122","18","He makes himself very scarce."
"217","tt0033045","2122","19","And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to Frank Morgan."
"218","tt0033045","2122","20","You really hate people like that, I've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day."
"219","tt0033045","2122","21","Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time."
"220","tt0033045","2123","1","Of the three remakes of this plot, I like them all, I have all three on VHS and in addition have a copy of this one on DVD."
"221","tt0033045","2123","2","There is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re watchable."
"222","tt0033045","2123","3","In addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each."
"223","tt0033045","2123","4","Of course the main stars in this one are great, but the supporting actors are also superb."
"224","tt0033045","2123","5","I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi."
"225","tt0033045","2123","6","He was such a scene stealer that I have searched to find other movies he is in."
"226","tt0033045","2123","7","He appeared in many, but most are not available."
"227","tt0033045","2123","8","As the other comments, I also say buy this one."
"228","tt0033045","2124","1","This is a truly classic movie in its story, acting, and film presentation."
"229","tt0033045","2124","2","Wonderful actors are replete throughout the whole movie, Miss Sullivan, and Jimmy Stewart being the foremost characters."
"230","tt0033045","2124","3","In real life she greatly admired, and liked Jimmy, and indeed gave him his basically first acting roles, and helped him be more calm with his appearance on the set."
"231","tt0033045","2124","4","The ""chemistry"" between the two was always apparent, and so warm and enjoyable to behold."
"232","tt0033045","2124","5","She was such a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality portrayals."
"233","tt0033045","2124","6","The story of these two young people, and how they eventually come together in the end is charming to watch, and pure magical entertainment."
"234","tt0033045","2124","7","Heart warming presentations are also given by the other supporting actors in this marvelous story/movie."
"235","tt0033045","2124","8","I whole heartily give Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, that has a special appeal for all generations."
"236","tt0033045","2124","9","A must see for all!"
"237","tt0033045","2125","1","This, despite not being the original it began life as a play in Central Europe has weathered the several incarnations that followed MGM's own remake with period songs In The Good Old Summertime, the Broadway show She Loves Me, even the excellent theatre revival in Paris a couple of years ago and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat."
"238","tt0033045","2125","2","Several previous commenters have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s Hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today try, for example, removing Ugarte, Ferrari, Renault etc from Casablanca and yes you'd still have Rick and Ilsa and Viktor Lazslo but they'd just be frosting without the rich cake mixture below."
"239","tt0033045","2125","3","Jimmy Stewart and Maggie Sullavan WERE both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, Joseph Schildkraut and Andy Hardy's Sara Haden and this is BEFORE we factor in that Lubitsch 'touch'."
"240","tt0033045","2125","4","Okay, maybe they WERE a tad more naive, innocent even, in that Jurassic Age but how many genuine film lovers, sated with scatology, screwing and in your face sex, turn back to those days of Stories, Style, Slickness and Skill and wallow in great movies like this one."
"241","tt0033045","2125","5","By far the best thing about this technological age is not CSI but DVD that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the Matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it."
"242","tt0033045","2126","1","Much about love & life can be learned from watching the folks at THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.Ernst Lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film."
"243","tt0033045","2126","2","With sparkling dialogue courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie."
"244","tt0033045","2126","3","Always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers, and favoring sophistication over slapstick, the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive, enigmatic quality known as the Lubitsch touch.'"
"245","tt0033045","2126","4","Although the story is set in Budapest and there is a jumble of accents among the players this is of no consequence."
"246","tt0033045","2126","5","The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great American city or small town could easily be the locus for the action."
"247","tt0033045","2126","6","Jimmy Stewart & Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other without knowing it."
"248","tt0033045","2126","7","Their dialogue so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural perfectly conveys their confusion & quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates."
"249","tt0033045","2126","8","Theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema."
"250","tt0033045","2126","9","Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold."
"251","tt0033045","2126","10","An accomplished scene stealer, he allows no emotion to escape unvented."
"252","tt0033045","2126","11","Additionally, Morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments near the end when he determines that his store's newest employee, an impoverished youth, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve."
"253","tt0033045","2126","12","Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals, this time that of a toadying, sycophantic Lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him."
"254","tt0033045","2126","13","Gentle Felix Bressart has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop intrigues, yet remains a steadfast friend to Stewart."
"255","tt0033045","2126","14","Sara Haden graces the small role of a sales clerk."
"256","tt0033045","2126","15","William Tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force."
"257","tt0033045","2126","16","In tiny roles, Charles Halton plays a no nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous doctor."
"258","tt0033045","2126","17","Movie mavens will recognize Mary Carr & Mabel Colcord both uncredited in their single scene as Miss Sullavan's grandmother & aunt."
"259","tt0033045","2127","1","Calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading."
"260","tt0033045","2127","2","The genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formulaic and overly predictable."
"261","tt0033045","2127","3","The Shop Around the Corner does not suffer from these illnesses: it manages to create a recognisably middle/eastern European atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the also strong nominal leads; I avoid using the words 'supporting cast' as for example Mr."
"262","tt0033045","2127","4","Matuschek Frank Morgan has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance."
"263","tt0033045","2127","5","The 1998 film You've Got Mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen pal' idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake."
"264","tt0033045","2127","6","This is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie it shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that is all."
"265","tt0033045","2128","1","I just watched this on Turner Classic Movies Last night, for the first time ever seeing it, and I loved it."
"266","tt0033045","2128","2","I like lots of the older films, especially because of the absence of all the filthy language, and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's films."
"267","tt0033045","2128","3","I also think they were made much better in many but not all cases."
"268","tt0033045","2128","4","Jimmy Stewart is a special favorite of mine."
"269","tt0033045","2128","5","I just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and I enjoyed it thoroughly."
"270","tt0033045","2128","6","If you feel the same way about the older films I don't think you can go wrong with this one."
"271","tt0033045","2128","7","I believe ""You've Got Mail"" is a remakeeven though slightly different and also a very enjoyable film. of this film."
"272","tt0033045","2128","8","For a relaxing evening with a movie you don't have to be ashamed of if your kids or anyone walks in on your viewing, get this,or catch it on one of the classic movie channels."
"273","tt0033045","2129","1","Sweet romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is."
"274","tt0033045","2129","2","Naturally, they work together and can't stand each other."
"275","tt0033045","2129","3","You can guess the rest."
"276","tt0033045","2129","4","It's beautifully acted by the entire cast especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan, has a witty, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning."
"277","tt0033045","2129","5","It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself believing I was seeing Budapest!"
"278","tt0033045","2129","6","Everything looks so perfect and dream like."
"279","tt0033045","2129","7","A one of a kind film."
"280","tt0033045","2129","8","Don't miss it!"
"281","tt0033045","2130","1","A wonderful film, filled with great understated performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue."
"282","tt0033045","2130","2","What really distinguishes the film, however, is that undercurrent of sadness throughout."
"283","tt0033045","2130","3","The story is underscored by affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences."
"284","tt0033045","2130","4","Most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed, having been ripped apart by the beginning of World War II."
"285","tt0033045","2130","5","In fact, the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to the comic scenes."
"286","tt0033045","2130","6","Yet funny it is listen to Margaret Sullivan's harsh dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and watch his pained expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend ""of poetry and meanness""."
"287","tt0033045","2130","7","It's funny, pointed, and sad all at once."
"288","tt0033045","2130","8","A remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made."
"289","tt0033045","2131","1","This is a movie that gets better each time I see it."
"290","tt0033045","2131","2","There are so many nuanced performances in this."
"291","tt0033045","2131","3","William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief."
"292","tt0033045","2131","4","Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only ""villian"" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here."
"293","tt0033045","2131","5","Frank Morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, Mr."
"294","tt0033045","2131","6","Matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here."
"295","tt0033045","2131","7","I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch."
"296","tt0033045","2131","8","Very believable in every facet of his role."
"297","tt0033045","2131","9","The two leads are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman."
"298","tt0033045","2131","10","This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though."
"299","tt0033045","2131","11","The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him."
"300","tt0033045","2131","12","Mr."
"301","tt0033045","2131","13","Stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions."
"302","tt0033045","2131","14","Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding."
"303","tt0033045","2131","15","He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly."
"304","tt0033045","2131","16","In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium."
"305","tt0033045","2131","17","There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience."
"306","tt0033045","2131","18","At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft."
"307","tt0033045","2131","19","This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find."
"308","tt0033045","2131","20","I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart."
"309","tt0033045","2132","1","The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man vs. woman argue all the time but wind up in love type of Hollywood screwball romance/comedy."
"310","tt0033045","2132","2","I usually don't go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, and oozes with charm."
"311","tt0033045","2132","3","Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other well and make a very handsome couple."
"312","tt0033045","2132","4","The supporting cast is outstanding from the always likable Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut."
"313","tt0033045","2132","5","Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him do in his career."
"314","tt0033045","2132","6","He takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him."
"315","tt0033045","2132","7","That ""twist"" is another reason this film rises above others of its kind."
"316","tt0033045","2132","8","Once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds."
"317","tt0033045","2132","9","This is a great example of that."
"318","tt0033045","2132","10","In this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done."
"319","tt0033045","2132","11","I'll take this over the re make ""You've Got Mail,"" any day."
"320","tt0033045","2132","12","No comparison."
"321","tt0033045","2133","1","I have lost count of just how many times I have seen this movie I probably know the entire dialog backwards yet I am drawn to it time and again."
"322","tt0033045","2133","2","Set in Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the eligible bachelor ""Kralik"" who becomes the secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan's innocent ""Klara""."
"323","tt0033045","2133","3","Kralik secretly becomes Klara's pen friend, and at work together Klara confides in Kralik about the content of his Kralik's letters."
"324","tt0033045","2133","4","Clearly Kralik is besotted with Klara but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the ""pen friend""."
"325","tt0033045","2133","5","Confused."
"326","tt0033045","2133","6","Well you wont be this story has a sweet, almost sugary ending but we all know it is the ending we all want."
"327","tt0033045","2133","7","Other characters worth mentioning are Frank Morgan playing his usual role, this time as the shop's owner ""Hugo Matuschek"", Felix Bressart as ""Pirovitch"", Kralik's confidant."
"328","tt0033045","2133","8","Joseph Schildkraut as the womanising arrogant ""Vadas"" so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning."
"329","tt0033045","2133","9","Finally William Tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his over confident upstart of a shop junior ""Pepi Katona""."
"330","tt0033045","2133","10","Recently re made as ""You've Got Mail"" starring Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original although I suspect younger audiences would disagree."
"331","tt0033045","2133","11","If this film is on in your area over Christmas, I suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of Kleenex handy."
"332","tt0033045","2134","1","Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to the American cinema is enormous."
"333","tt0033045","2134","2","His legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever, as is the case with ""The Shop Around the Corner""."
"334","tt0033045","2134","3","This film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play, without the charm or elegance of Mr."

"336","tt0033045","2134","5","Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked in several films together."
"337","tt0033045","2134","6","Their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all."
"338","tt0033045","2134","7","Both stars are delightful as the pen pals that don't know of one another, but who fate had them working together in the same shop in Budapest."
"339","tt0033045","2134","8","The reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture."
"340","tt0033045","2134","9","In here, we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, playing the owner of the shop."
"341","tt0033045","2134","10","Also, we see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing impressive work in making us believe that yes, they are in Budapest."
"342","tt0033045","2134","11","That is why these films will live forever!"
"343","tt0037514","4455","1","Though I liked On the Town better I really liked it."
"344","tt0037514","4455","2","I'm a new comer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly."
"345","tt0037514","4455","3","Though I had heard of them I had never seen anything with them in it until recently."
"346","tt0037514","4455","4","The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain that made me a fan of Gene's."
"347","tt0037514","4455","5","I think that is better too."
"348","tt0037514","4455","6","But I thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it's an awesome movie and I love it."
"349","tt0037514","4455","7","Frank and Gene make a good team."
"350","tt0037514","4455","8","I have yet to see them together in Take me out to the Ballgame."
"351","tt0037514","4455","9","But I'm sticking to my guns bu saying that I really enjoyed it, and that I love it!"
"352","tt0037514","4456","1","Lots of singing and dancing in this one, especially by Gene Kelly."
"353","tt0037514","4456","2","Two sailors go on liberty to see if they can find love and romance."
"354","tt0037514","4456","3","They meet up with a woman who is trying to break into show business."
"355","tt0037514","4456","4","Musical lovers only."
"356","tt0037514","4457","1","Yes, this is one of the great musical movies I grew up with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson."
"357","tt0037514","4457","2","The music and dancing is superb."
"358","tt0037514","4457","3","I understand Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is quite unique for the time."
"359","tt0037514","4457","4","Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra."
"360","tt0037514","4457","5","She is one of Hollywood's great underrated stars."
"361","tt0037514","4457","6","I saw this again on A&E TV and as well have it in my old VCR tapes."
"362","tt0037514","4457","7","Never get tired of these old musicals."
"363","tt0037514","4457","8","Whatever happened to Hollywood.."
"364","tt0037514","4458","1","This has some excellent spots but the length of the film can not sustain the wafer thin plot."
"365","tt0037514","4458","2","It is another sailors on leave film, zippier than Astaire's 'Follow the Fleet' but not as good as 'On The Town'."
"366","tt0037514","4458","3","Kathryn Grayson is bland but Kelly and Sinatra work well together."
"367","tt0037514","4458","4","Their 'If you Knew Susie' number is hilarious as they make up the song as they sing it."
"368","tt0037514","4458","5","'I Begged Her' is also fun with Sinatra showing how adept he was at hoofing."
"369","tt0037514","4458","6","Sinatra's solo songs are dull and seem to be inserted to show off his singing rather than as part of the story."
"370","tt0037514","4458","7","Fortunately there are accomplished supporting actors like Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and an unlikely but impertubable Jose Iturbi as himself, to keep one watching."
"371","tt0037514","4458","8","Kelly is the star of the film, although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children, which Astaire never did."
"372","tt0037514","4458","9","Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and latches on to the Kelly character."
"373","tt0037514","4458","10","He also visit a school resulting in him telling the children a fictitious story of his life in the Pomeranian !"
"374","tt0037514","4458","11","navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated Jerry Mouse."
"375","tt0037514","4458","12","In another scene he dances a charming Mexican Hat Dance with a sublimely grave faced little girl, Sharon McManus, that is entrancing and sweet."
"376","tt0037514","4458","13","Very pleasant then but a bit too long."
"377","tt0037514","4458","14","A taster of better musicals to come."
"378","tt0037514","4459","1","For such films like `Anchors Aweigh', few have been bestowed with as many Academy Award accolades in a warm up for happy hour."
"379","tt0037514","4459","2","Either 1945 was a beleaguered year for good film or they were still suffering advance shock by Billy Wilder's `The Lost Weekend' that they wrote anything starting with A on the ballot for best picture to please the still musical picture faithful public."
"380","tt0037514","4459","3","Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in `Singin' in the Rain', then there had to be something wrong with the behind the scenes rigging systems at MGM."
"381","tt0037514","4459","4","Of course, the studio is on its best behaviour during this much lauded tour of the great studios and of Hollywood itself, handy for those stuck on the other side of the world."
"382","tt0037514","4459","5","Yet a sailor suit musical with the brilliant talents of Gene and Frank Sinatra is certainly an enjoyable farce, despite the need for more people to yawn at the previews for the musical so today's audiences wouldn't be slapped with an unnecessary runtime."
"383","tt0037514","4459","6","There have been many longer pieces before and since, but in this case all of the charming Kathryn Grayson's scenes could have been eliminated."
"384","tt0037514","4459","7","Until the viewing of `Kiss Me Kate' it may have been necessary non opera enthusiasts to watch any of her films with remote control in hand."
"385","tt0037514","4459","8","If there was a need to practice picking up women for 1949's `On the Town', then perhaps the shore leave lucky sailors did not have to promise an audition with Jose Iturbi and strike up the piano for a whole hearted `Susie' rendition."
"386","tt0037514","4459","9","Few are lucky to get a screen test at the golden studios of MGM."
"387","tt0037514","4459","10","Then few are even luckier to be attended to."
"388","tt0037514","4459","11","There are no regrets to be had about the successful screen tests of Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson, but it makes the continual non opera enthusiast hope for the eventual pink slip to be handed out to both."
"389","tt0037514","4459","12","But for all, the star talents are good shape and an above average score thrown in with a slight, but fun great navy story intertwined with young ambitious navy boys good for late bursts of wartime morale, makes `Anchors' at least doesn't question picking the wrong MGM film."
"390","tt0037514","4459","13","The direction holds up as the cast carries the story in lovely colour cinematography."
"391","tt0037514","4459","14","Whenever anyone bursts into music or song, the film makes for a joyous occasion."
"392","tt0037514","4459","15","The natural highlight of the film is Gene Kelly's cartoon adventures in a fantasyland, climaxing in a brilliant dance with Jerry the mouse."
"393","tt0037514","4459","16","This is a well deserved masterpiece number of Kelly's career, and it's nice to know he thought of it before Fred Astaire started taking to dancing on walls and ceilings."
"394","tt0037514","4459","17","It's not exactly sitting down to a triple flavour, rainbow sprinkled, chocolate wafer, cream and cherry and banana split sundae, but it is a square solid lump of sugar that somehow eventually melts in your mouth and despite the guilt, is still a pleasant feeling."
"395","tt0037514","4459","18","Rating: 7/10"
"396","tt0037514","4460","1","Ah, a Kelly/Sinatra sailor suit musical."
"397","tt0037514","4460","2","So familiar, right."
"398","tt0037514","4460","3","Yes, but this isn't the one you usually hear about."
"399","tt0037514","4460","4","On The Town's that a way."
"400","tt0037514","4460","5","But if you stick around, you might learn something."
"401","tt0037514","4460","6","Okay, probably not."
"402","tt0037514","4460","7","Anyway, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a three or four day leave."
"403","tt0037514","4460","8","Joe is the ""Sea Wolf"" and Clarence, the bookish type, begs Joe to get him a ""dame""."
"404","tt0037514","4460","9","Now, after they're picked up by the coppers they get little Donald home."
"405","tt0037514","4460","10","That's where they meet Susie, that temptress, that jezebel."
"406","tt0037514","4460","11","Just kidding!"
"407","tt0037514","4460","12","Clarence falls in love with her."
"408","tt0037514","4460","13","At least he thinks he does."
"409","tt0037514","4460","14","Is he right."
"410","tt0037514","4460","15","Or is he a moron."
"411","tt0037514","4460","16","Or is he just misguided by society."
"412","tt0037514","4460","17","Find out all this and more when you watch trumpet fanfare ANCHORS AWEIGH!"
"413","tt0037514","4460","18","P.S."
"414","tt0037514","4460","19","If you want to see Kathryn Grayson be anything but sickeningly sweet, try Kiss Me Kate 1953."
"415","tt0037514","4461","1","I really liked this movie."
"416","tt0037514","4461","2","I have seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best."
"417","tt0037514","4461","3","I would actually put it above his more famous American in Paris."
"418","tt0037514","4461","4","Sometimes it seems the story gets lost in Gene Kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this movie."
"419","tt0037514","4461","5","It is definitely worth renting."
"420","tt0037514","4462","1","One of the first of the best musicals, Anchors Aweigh features several memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly dancing with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dancing with 7 year old Sharon McManus, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi playing piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi conducting, and much more."
"421","tt0037514","4462","2","The Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath, through transparent keys, and Grayson singing, seen through the finder of another camera."
"422","tt0037514","4462","3","The plot is thin, but you get involved from Kelly's & Sinatra's enthusiasm."
"423","tt0037514","4462","4","Sailor's on leave, they have to take home a runaway boy Dean Stockwell and Sinatra falls for his aunt."
"424","tt0037514","4462","5","To set him up with the aunt Grayson, Kelly suggests that Sinatra can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi."
"425","tt0037514","4462","6","But Sinatra's young and naive in this one, and in his own sung words falls in love too fast."
"426","tt0037514","4462","7","While they're trying to contact Iturbi, who's never available, he starts to fall for another girl Barbara Britton; but Kelly's now falling love with Grayson."
"427","tt0037514","4462","8","Anchors Aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live action / cartoon sequence with Tom and Jerry, but there's a lot more here that's worth a look."
"428","tt0037514","4462","9","I'm giving it nine stars because, while it's not quite as good as the best musicals Singin' In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma it is one of the first of their class of Technicolor big productions perhaps Meet Me In St."
"429","tt0037514","4462","10","Louis was the first, and better than most others."
"430","tt0037514","4463","1","A recent viewing of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT has given me the urge to watch many of the classic MGM musicals from the forties and fifties."
"431","tt0037514","4463","2","ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a lesser film than ON THE TOWN."
"432","tt0037514","4463","3","The songs aren't as good, nor is the chemistry between the characters."
"433","tt0037514","4463","4","But the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites, such as Tchaikovsky."
"434","tt0037514","4463","5","And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top, and then running down the steps, while dozens of pianists play on the piano, is the best scene in the film, even though the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous."
"435","tt0037514","4463","6","Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing."
"436","tt0037514","4463","7","Sinatra then croons, ""I Fall in Love Too Easily,"" before having his epiphany about whom he loves."
"437","tt0037514","4463","8","The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution free air Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, let alone the mid 1940s.!, and the piano music is absolutely glorious."
"438","tt0037514","4463","9","MGM certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these."
"439","tt0037514","4464","1","Incredibly ARTISTIC NOBODY COULD MAKE THEM NOW I THINK.It seem to be perfect the biggest and the greatest musical ever made listen to the beautiful songs the are quite poetry."
"440","tt0037514","4464","2","I'M Italian AND ADMIRED BY American MUSICAL. why can't you do something like that now."
"441","tt0037514","4464","3","American were the best and for that i absolutely show my devotion to you with this movie.there are words to describes the perfection of this movie. all of a sudden my heart sings, what makes the sunset. i fall in love to easily,jealousy...and the scene with Tom and Jerry. the greatest without reserve. if you you doesn't know your eyes are not open my friends you must see it and appreciate...wake up!"
"442","tt0037514","4465","1","ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but I wouldn't rate it up there with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON."
"443","tt0037514","4465","2","This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared in together."
"444","tt0037514","4465","3","Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors on leave in Hollywood who befriend a young boy Dean Stockwellwho introduces them to his attractive young aunt Kathryn Grayson a struggling actress who is working as an extra at MGM."
"445","tt0037514","4465","4","Though both guys are initially attracted to Grayson, she eventually voices a preference to Joe but Clarence later hooks up with a waitress Pamela Brittonwho, he learns is from his hometown of Brooklyn."
"446","tt0037514","4465","5","The paper thin plot leaves room for several great musical numbers including ""We Hate to Leave"", Joe and Clarence's lament to their fellow sailors as they're leaving the ship; Grayson's torrid rendition of ""Jalousie""; Sinatra's dreamy rendition of ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" a number which is sadly deleted from some prints of this film, and ""The Worry Song"", a fantasy dance that Kelly does with animated Jerry the Mouse from Tom and Jerry fame."
"447","tt0037514","4465","6","Kelly also does a sort of Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet which rivals his Pirate's Ballet in the later THE PIRATE."
"448","tt0037514","4465","7","Kelly is in peak form here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Sinatra's endearingly shy character here is undeniably sexy."
"449","tt0037514","4465","8","An entertaining diversion for fans of the MGM musical factory."
"450","tt0037514","4466","1","""Anchors Aweigh"" is the product of the classic MGM musical production unit, and on the whole the film is every enjoyable  good music by Jule Styne and others, excellent dancing by Gene Kelly and even a passable job by Frank Sinatra, and a funny well paced script."
"451","tt0037514","4466","2","The only major element I would criticize would be the casting of Kathryn Grayson, whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudo operatic warbling from the petite Miss."
"452","tt0037514","4466","3","Kelly plays a naval serviceman named Joseph Brady, a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose Valentino charms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middle American name of Clarence Sinatra."
"453","tt0037514","4466","4","Upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving Clarence's life, Joe reluctantly agrees to help Clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life."
"454","tt0037514","4466","5","They are drafted by a policeman Rags Ragland, who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy Dean Stockwell who wants to join the Navy into returning home to ""Aunt Susan"" Grayson."
"455","tt0037514","4466","6","At first it is Clarence who is interested in wooing ""Aunt Susan"" but eventually Kelly's character emerges as the more likely candidate."
"456","tt0037514","4466","7","There are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to Kelly's more famous work in films like ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""American in Paris""."
"457","tt0037514","4466","8","The closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with Kelly's character in a fantasy sequence dancing with Jerry, the mouse from ""Tom and Jerry"" although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse."
"458","tt0037514","4466","9","It's a startling sequence for its time but doesn't have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time."
"459","tt0037514","4466","10","I actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation, where Kelly was using semi balletic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of ""Alice in Wonderland""."
"460","tt0037514","4466","11","Eventually the characters find their way to Susan's favorite bar, a somewhat sanitized Mexican restaurant/bar in Tijuana."
"461","tt0037514","4466","12","There the patrons happily allow Ms."
"462","tt0037514","4466","13","Grayson to chirp her arias with abandon, and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that Clarence and Joe have extended for her to sing with their ""friend"" Jose Iturbi playing himself with a light humorous touch."
"463","tt0037514","4466","14","Of course they've never met their ""friend"" Iturbi and they spend much of the film's length trying to reach him in an amusing scene Sinatra's character meets Iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career, sneaking into the studio and the Hollywood Bowl, where Iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players  you haven't seen anything like this outside of ""1000 Fingers of Dr."
"464","tt0037514","4466","15","T""."
"465","tt0037514","4466","16","Iturbi himself is a kind of a god figure in the story  he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine."
"466","tt0037514","4466","17","Everyone is 100% sure that as soon as Mr."
"467","tt0037514","4466","18","Iturbi so much as hears Ms."
"468","tt0037514","4466","19","Grayson, her operatic career will be a reality."
"469","tt0037514","4466","20","The 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure  a lot of the film's charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very down to earth ""real"" mannerisms of the maestro."
"470","tt0037514","4466","21","And speaking of Iturbi's contributions to the film, he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of ""Donkey Serenade""."
"471","tt0037514","4466","22","When all is said and done, this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss."
"472","tt0037514","4466","23","The majority of the music was written for this film, a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other Kelly opuses like ""Rain"" and ""American""."
"473","tt0037514","4466","24","Kelly is still at his early peak, adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character."
"474","tt0037514","4466","25","Sinatra's voice was never in better form and he rarely had better songs to sing."
"475","tt0037514","4466","26","Stockwell is a charming addition to the clan, and Grayson's character is endearing when she isn't posturing on stage."
"476","tt0037514","4466","27","Iturbi adds that well grounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classic era MGM musical."
"477","tt0037514","4466","28","This is one of the better ones."
"478","tt0037514","4467","1","Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson."
"479","tt0037514","4467","2","The film won and Oscar for George E."
"480","tt0037514","4467","3","Stoll's score, and it garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Son nomination for ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" sung by Sinatra."
"481","tt0037514","4467","4","It was a cute story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself."
"482","tt0037514","4467","5","The lovely Grayson The Toast of New Orleans dazzled us with her singing, and we had a lot of great songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the artistry of pianist conductor José Iturbi."
"483","tt0037514","4467","6","A classic Hollywood music from an era gone by."
"484","tt0037514","4468","1","Two sailors are on leave ladies man Joseph Brady Gene Kelly and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle Frank Sinatra."
"485","tt0037514","4468","2","They meet beautiful Susan Abbott Kathryn Grayson and both fall in love with her."
"486","tt0037514","4468","3","There's more but you've probably guessed it."
"487","tt0037514","4468","4","The story even for a 1940s musical is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome gets annoying pretty quick."
"488","tt0037514","4468","5","Also this movie is far too long."
"489","tt0037514","4468","6","It's 140 minutes and that's way too much for such a silly story."
"490","tt0037514","4468","7","There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra."
"491","tt0037514","4468","8","Still this is worth catching."
"492","tt0037514","4468","9","When Kelly is dancing or Sinatra or Grayson are singing this becomes magical."
"493","tt0037514","4468","10","None of the songs are particularly memorable but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won't care."
"494","tt0037514","4468","11","It's shot in rich Technicolor with all the gloss MGM had."
"495","tt0037514","4468","12","The acting is OK Kelly is fine although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it and Sinatra is just great although seeing HIM as a shy guy was pushing it too!."
"496","tt0037514","4468","13","Grayson is given nothing to do but she's incredibly beautiful to look at."
"497","tt0037514","4468","14","Some shots of her literally took my breath away!"
"498","tt0037514","4468","15","There are plenty of highlights here: Sinatra and Kelly's big dancing and singing number; Sinatra singing anything; Grayson's two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry an animated mouse!"
"499","tt0037514","4468","16","Tom does a funny cameo too."
"500","tt0037514","4468","17","Also there's little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he's in."
"501","tt0037514","4468","18","So it's too long and the plot just doesn't hold up but it's still worth catching."
"502","tt0037514","4468","19","This was a huge hit in its day."
"503","tt0037514","4469","1","Usually musicals in the 1940's were of a set formula and if you studied films you know what I'm talking about a certain running lenghth, very ""showy"" performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc."
"504","tt0037514","4469","2","THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT and light years better and well worth it's nomination for best picture of the year 1945 although had no chance of beating the eventual winner Lost Weekend."
"505","tt0037514","4469","3","Gene Kelly was probably in the best form of his career yes I know about ""American in Paris"" and ""Singing in the Rain""."
"506","tt0037514","4469","4","This one is different."
"507","tt0037514","4469","5","He really gets into his character of a ""sea wolf"" thinking at first that ""picking up any girl while on leave"" is nothing more than a lark."
"508","tt0037514","4469","6","And if you had to make up a ""story"" to get her so be it until."
"509","tt0037514","4469","7","Sort of like the Music Man when he gets ""his foot caught in the door""."
"510","tt0037514","4469","8","The eventual hilarity of the film stems mostly from his and his new pal Sinatra's attempt to make the ""story"" good in order to ""get the girl"" that he REALLY and unexpectedly falls in love with."
"511","tt0037514","4469","9","You are going to have to see the movie to see what I mean."
"512","tt0037514","4469","10","Besides that there are so many other elements of great film in this one, it's a classic buddy story, nostalgia to a time when WWII was almost over the war ended about a month after the films release, a realization that a guy that always laughed at life can find out that he really is a great human being, great songs and probably a few other elements of classic film making that I can't think of right now."
"513","tt0037514","4469","11","Why not a 10."
"514","tt0037514","4469","12","Near the end at nearly 2 1/2 hours starts to feel a bit long."
"515","tt0037514","4469","13","There is a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now."
"516","tt0037514","4469","14","But overall, this ones a definite winner on every level."
"517","tt0037514","4470","1","Similar to ""On the Town,"" this musical about sailors on shore leave falls short of the later classic in terms of pacing and the quality of the songs, but it has its own charms."
"518","tt0037514","4470","2","Kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with Jerry the cartoon mouse of ""Tom and Jerry"" fame, one with a little girl, and a fantasy sequence where he is a Spanish lover determined to reach his lady on a high balcony."
"519","tt0037514","4470","3","Sinatra, playing Kelly's shy, inexperienced buddy, and Grayson, the woman who serves as the love interest for both men, do most of the singing."
"520","tt0037514","4470","4","Iturbi provides some fine piano playing."
"521","tt0037514","4470","5","At nearly two and half hours, it is a bit too long for a light musical but it doesn't drag."
"522","tt0037514","4471","1","Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, and Jose Iturbi star in ""Anchors Aweigh,"" directed by George Sidney."
"523","tt0037514","4471","2","Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two navy guys on leave in Hollywood."
"524","tt0037514","4471","3","They meet a little boy Dean Stockwell and on taking him home, they meet his aunt Grayson."
"525","tt0037514","4471","4","Clarence falls for her."
"526","tt0037514","4471","5","She wants an audition for Jose Iturbi."
"527","tt0037514","4471","6","They try to help, but there's a mix up."
"528","tt0037514","4471","7","This is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra."
"529","tt0037514","4471","8","Kelly gets to dance with Jerry the Mouse in a delightful sequence."
"530","tt0037514","4471","9","Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings."
"531","tt0037514","4471","10","Not one of my favorite voices, but she does well."
"532","tt0037514","4471","11","Iturbi's piano work is beautiful."
"533","tt0037514","4471","12","Sinatra gets to show his versatility and why the girls swooned over him, with those big blue eyes and boyish face."
"534","tt0037514","4471","13","For Kelly, this was a major break for him at MGM.Wonderful movie, very buoyant."
"535","tt0037514","4472","1","Right from the start you see that ""Anchors Aweigh"" is a great comedy."
"536","tt0037514","4472","2","Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team!"
"537","tt0037514","4472","3","The songs they sing together are pure entertainment."
"538","tt0037514","4472","4","Kathryn Grayson is gorgeous and really sweet."
"539","tt0037514","4472","5","Dean Stockwell is the cutiest child actor I've never seen."
"540","tt0037514","4472","6","If you are fond of piano, you'll be amazed by José Iturbi."
"541","tt0037514","4472","7","This movie was the first one to combine animation with real actors and it did that wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number."
"542","tt0037514","4472","8","Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest movies."
"543","tt0037514","4473","1","Although in my opinion this is one of the lesser musicals of stars Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly, Kathryn Grayson and director George Sidney, a lesser musical featuring anyone from that line up is nothing to sneeze at, and in conjunction, the line up makes Anchors Aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws."
"544","tt0037514","4473","2","Sinatra and Kelly are Clarence Doolittle and Joseph Brady, respectively, two Navy men."
"545","tt0037514","4473","3","As the film begins, they're just pulling in to the Los Angeles area for some much needed leave."
"546","tt0037514","4473","4","Brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named Lola."
"547","tt0037514","4473","5","Doolittle is still a bit wet behind the ears, appropriately enough, and seeks advice on women from Brady in private publicly, scriptwriter Isobel Lennart and Sidney have all of the Navy men comically exaggerating their finesse with women to each other."
"548","tt0037514","4473","6","Brady promises to help get Doolittle hooked up, but primarily because Doolittle won't leave him alone otherwise."
"549","tt0037514","4473","7","A kink is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the Navy."
"550","tt0037514","4473","8","He won't give the police any information about who he is or where he lives."
"551","tt0037514","4473","9","Brady helps and he and Doolittle end up taking the boy back home."
"552","tt0037514","4473","10","When the boy's guardian, Susan Abbott Grayson, finally shows up, Doolittle goes gaga for her."
"553","tt0037514","4473","11","Brady tries to convince him to forget about her; Brady just wants to get back to Lola."
"554","tt0037514","4473","12","But they keep getting coaxed back to Abbott's home, and eventually something of a love triangle forms."
"555","tt0037514","4473","13","Things become more complicated when Brady lies about Doolittle knowing a famous musician, Jose Iturbi, who is in residence at a film studio, and claims that Doolittle has set up an audition for Abbott, who is a singer and actress, in front of Iturbi."
"556","tt0037514","4473","14","Because of the story, the music is a strange combination of militaristic music because of the Navy premise, obviously, Broadway pop what the stars tend to sing in more informal settings, opera what Abbott's character excels at, Liberace like popular classical what Iturbi did, and Mexican music because Abbott frequents a Mexican restaurant in a Mexican section of L.A."
"557","tt0037514","4473","15","The combination doesn't work as well as it could."
"558","tt0037514","4473","16","Plenty of the songs are good, and everyone involved is certainly talented as a singer or musician, but the genre hopping tends to lose coherence."
"559","tt0037514","4473","17","Worse, there are a couple showcases for Iturbi, who was apparently a big star at the time, that effectively bring the plot to a halt and that seem more than a bit hokey at this point in time."
"560","tt0037514","4473","18","I just watched another film that happened to have outstanding music, Robert Altman's Kansas City 1996, but that misguidedly stopped the plot to periodically turn into a concert film."
"561","tt0037514","4473","19","Anchors Aweigh takes a similar tactic."
"562","tt0037514","4473","20","Yes, this is a musical, but there's a difference between songs that propel and are integral to the plot and concert showcases that seem like contractual obligation material."
"563","tt0037514","4473","21","There are also some plot problems."
"564","tt0037514","4473","22","It's not very well established why Brady is so against Doolittle's pursuit of Abbott."
"565","tt0037514","4473","23","We can guess that Brady thinks Doolittle shouldn't become involved with someone who has to take care of a kid, and who seems relatively ""proper"" and traditional, but on the other hand, Brady can tell that Doolittle doesn't have the same womanizing disposition that Brady admits of himself."
"566","tt0037514","4473","24","Abbott seems like a good fit for Doolittle, and furthermore, Lennart works hard to establish that Brady just wants to get Doolittle out of his hair and get on with meeting Lola it seems that Brady's character should be quickly pawning Doolittle off on any candidate, whether she's a good fit or not."
"567","tt0037514","4473","25","This might seem like a minor detail, but it's actually the hinge for about a third to half of the plot."
"568","tt0037514","4473","26","The story also seems a bit drawn out."
"569","tt0037514","4473","27","Length is a problem."
"570","tt0037514","4473","28","Anchors Aweigh, clocking in at roughly two hours and twenty minutes, should have been cut down by at least a half hour."
"571","tt0037514","4473","29","The above surely sounds like I'm complaining about the film too much to justify an 8."
"572","tt0037514","4473","30","I just wanted to stress what I see as flaws, because the conventional wisdom on Anchors Aweigh is much closer to the idea that it has no flaws."
"573","tt0037514","4473","31","Sinatra, Kelly and Grayson are certainly charismatic, separately and together."
"574","tt0037514","4473","32","They turn in good, interesting performances."
"575","tt0037514","4473","33","Sinatra looks and acts much younger than his actual age of 29  30 while shooting."
"576","tt0037514","4473","34","He plays an unusually naïve, virginal character completely different than most of the roles he would take later, and different than his public image as a crooner."
"577","tt0037514","4473","35","For Kelly, this was his breakthrough film, and rightfully so."
"578","tt0037514","4473","36","His choreography is varied and impressive, as is his acting."
"579","tt0037514","4473","37","Grayson is charming, her performance is sophisticatedly understated, and she's simply gorgeous."
"580","tt0037514","4473","38","All of this helps override the flaws with the script and the drawn out pacing."
"581","tt0037514","4473","39","And there's even a very interesting element that probably only arises because Sidney was allowed to sprawl over a large variety of moods the infamous Kelly dance with Jerry the Mouse of ""Tom and Jerry"" fame in an extended fantasy sequence."
"582","tt0037514","4473","40","This is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation, and it is extremely well done and enjoyable as long as you're a fan of fantasy."
"583","tt0037514","4473","41","The fantasy sequences tend to be the best of the film."
"584","tt0037514","4473","42","Matched in excellence to the dance with Jerry the Mouse is a long song and dance number featuring Kelly and Grayson, where Brady is imagining Abbott in a scene from a period film while he woos her, having to resort to acrobatic stunts to reach her physically as she stands on a high balcony."
"585","tt0037514","4473","43","As uneven and flawed as the film is, it is largely successful and entertaining to watch."
"586","tt0037514","4473","44","Fans of classic musicals certainly shouldn't miss Anchors Aweigh, and neither should Sinatra fans, who'll get quite a kick out of his character."
"587","tt0037514","4474","1","This film like Astaire's ROYAL WEDDING which was shown after it on Turner Classic Network last night is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in Gene Kelly's record: Like Fred Astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a room's walls and ceiling, this film had Gene Kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with Jerry Mouse."
"588","tt0037514","4474","2","The sequence is nicely done."
"589","tt0037514","4474","3","What is forgotten is that Kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to Dean Stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day, and sets the stage for the sequence by having Stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background."
"590","tt0037514","4474","4","Kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white ""Pomeranian"" navy uniform with blue stripes on it."
"591","tt0037514","4474","5","Jerry Mouse does more than dance with Gene."
"592","tt0037514","4474","6","He actually talks a first that he did not repeat for many decades."
"593","tt0037514","4474","7","He also finally puts Tom Cat into his proper place Tom briefly appears as King Jerry's butler, trying to cheer him with a platter of cheeses."
"594","tt0037514","4474","8","But the sequence of the cartoon with Kelly took about seven minutes of the movie."
"595","tt0037514","4474","9","Far more of this peculiar film is taken up with Kelly's story of the lost four day furlough in Hollywood, and how Kelly ends up meeting Katherine Grayson and with Frank Sinatra stalking Jose Iturbi at the MGM film studio, the Hollywood Bowl, and Iturbi's own home."
"596","tt0037514","4474","10","Except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbing."
"597","tt0037514","4474","11","Kelly has saved Sinatra's life in the Pacific, and is getting a medal as a result."
"598","tt0037514","4474","12","They are both among the crewmen back in California who are getting a four day leave."
"599","tt0037514","4474","13","But the script writers to propel what would be a short film Kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one ""Lola"", an unseen good time girl in Hollywood saddle Gene with Frank."
"600","tt0037514","4474","14","It seems Frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie factories particularly musical comedies who are socially underdeveloped and in need of ""instruction"" about meeting girls or guys if the characters are women."
"601","tt0037514","4474","15","Frank insists that Gene help ""teach him"" how to get a girl."
"602","tt0037514","4474","16","Just then a policeman takes them to headquarters to help the cops with a little boy Stockwell who insists on joining the navy and won't give the cops his real name and address."
"603","tt0037514","4474","17","When a protesting Kelly is able to get this information out of Stockwell by asking him some straight questions which the cops could not ask, they insist Kelly take the boy home to his aunt Grayson."
"604","tt0037514","4474","18","Still protesting, Kelly gets saddled with increasingly complicated problems mostly due to Sinatra's simplistic soul view of things."
"605","tt0037514","4474","19","He misses seeing Lola the next day by sleeping late Sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up."
"606","tt0037514","4474","20","He keeps getting dragged back to Grayson's house, as Sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself, but needs Kelly to train him in love making."
"607","tt0037514","4474","21","I suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of ANCHORS AWEIGH, but I find this kind of story irritating."
"608","tt0037514","4474","22","While the singing and dancing and concert music of Kelly, Sinatra, Grayson, and Iturbi are first rate, it is annoying to have to take the idiocies of someone like Sinatra's character seriously."
"609","tt0037514","4474","23","In the real world Kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day furlough what right has he to insist as Sinatra does that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date."
"610","tt0037514","4474","24","That kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsense."
"611","tt0037514","4474","25","The stalking of Iturbi is likewise annoying."
"612","tt0037514","4474","26","Kelly tries to get Grayson to like Sinatra when he says Sinatra can get her a meeting with Jose Iturbi to audition her singing ability."
"613","tt0037514","4474","27","For much of the rest of the picture Sinatra and Kelly try to do that, and keep floundering at one point for no really good reason Grayson herself ruins Kelly's attempt to get an interview at MGM with Iturbi."
"614","tt0037514","4474","28","It is only sheer luck that Iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed Grayson that she does give him an audition of her talent."
"615","tt0037514","4474","29","Kelly, by the way, ends up with Grayson."
"616","tt0037514","4474","30","Sinatra's conscience at not being able to help her see Iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her but not pulling Kelly into it, oddly enough and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress Pamela Britton from his native Brooklyn."
"617","tt0037514","4474","31","And naturally, without any assistance from Kelly, Sinatra and Britton fall in love."
"618","tt0037514","4474","32","Ah,""consistency""!"
"619","tt0037514","4474","33","Thy name is not ""screenwriting"" necessarily!"
"620","tt0037514","4475","1","The United States was still fighting World War II the movie was released in between VE day and VJ day."
"621","tt0037514","4475","2","Any studio worth its salt was either making fighting movies where fearless American soldiers beat the enemy, or Americans in general were singing and dancing."
"622","tt0037514","4475","3","Technicolor Musicals were what America thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed."
"623","tt0037514","4475","4","Most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time til the next musical number!"
"624","tt0037514","4475","5","I get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970."
"625","tt0037514","4475","6","Depressing how quickly we forget."
"626","tt0037514","4475","7","This film could've been called ""The Search for Jose Iturbi"" but now everyone wonders why."
"627","tt0037514","4475","8","Allow me to explain."
"628","tt0037514","4475","9","From 1929 his arrival in America until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the finest pianists to grace a concert stage."
"629","tt0037514","4475","10","He agreed to do a few movies in 1942, but Hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time."
"630","tt0037514","4475","11","Not only an excellent pianist, but a successful conductor as well, Iturbi was very much a household word for more than 40 years."
"631","tt0037514","4475","12","The scene where Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies was planned early on and hasn't anyone ever noticed the other pianists were all children."
"632","tt0037514","4475","13","Joe Pasternak, who produced that movie & many other MGM musicals, credited Iturbi with interesting America's youth in classical music."
"633","tt0037514","4475","14","Grayson's wanting an audition with Iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time."
"634","tt0037514","4475","15","Everyone wanted Iturbi back then."
"635","tt0037514","4475","16","The joke among soldiers was that ""GI"" meant ""Get Iturbi"" he did a lot of concerts at military bases."
"636","tt0037514","4475","17","Gene Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra an excellent singer, but at the time this movie was made Sinatra was barely 30 and had only been under contract to Columbia Records for four years."
"637","tt0037514","4475","18","Kelly was already well known as a dancer, but Iturbi had by then been a world wide sensation for 20+ years."
"638","tt0037514","4475","19","And as to the lack of a plot, Americans didn't need plot."
"639","tt0037514","4475","20","They were tired of war, they were sick with fear for their loved ones, and worried about the future."
"640","tt0037514","4475","21","They needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out fine in the end."
"641","tt0037514","4475","22","They needed music and smiles and joy and romance."
"642","tt0037514","4475","23","This movie and others like it delivered just what was needed."
"643","tt0037514","4475","24","Enough lecturing."
"644","tt0037514","4475","25","Mouse dancing aside, the best scene in the movie occurs between Sinatra and Iturbi with each of them ""ignorantly"" complimenting the other's music."
"645","tt0037514","4475","26","If you have any interest in Jose Iturbi, the Spaniard who conquered more of America than De Soto, Cortez, and De Leon put together, please drop by my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find a plot summary, excerpts from movie reviews ""of the day"" and pictures from this and certain other MGM musicals of the 1940's, as well as a biography and discography of Iturbi."

"673","tt0037514","4476","27","The most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world, and there Gene sings and dances with Jerry Mouse."
"674","tt0037514","4476","28","Also Tom Cat is seen there as the butler."
"675","tt0037514","4476","29","They originally asked Mickey Mouse but he refused."
"676","tt0037514","4476","30","The movie was nominated for five Oscars but Georgie Stoll got one for Original Music Score."
"677","tt0037514","4476","31","Anchors Aweigh is some high class entertainment."
"678","tt0037514","4477","1","This one has a lot going for it Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten and a lesser amount of dross Iturbi, Grayson plus a little ho hum Kelly."
"679","tt0037514","4477","2","It was Sinatra's first real movie where the producer's spent a buck and you could see it on screen previously he'd appeared in two low budgeters, Higher And Higher and Step Lively but if they'd only relied on the Sinatra pipes and deep sixed Grayson's plus Iturbi's ego tripping piano spots we'd have been left with a much tighter movie and a better showcase for Sinatra."
"680","tt0037514","4477","3","As it is he scores heavily in all his songs from the two duets with Kelly We Hate To Leave, I Begged Her to his own solos, What Makes The Sunset, The Charm Of You and I Fall In Love Too Easily."
"681","tt0037514","4477","4","Despite this Step Lively remains the best Sinatra musical of the forties on one tenth the budget."
"682","tt0037514","4478","1","Overall this is a delightful, light hearted, romantic, musical comedy."
"683","tt0037514","4478","2","I suppose a small case could be made for the movie being to long."
"684","tt0037514","4478","3","But I'm not sure what you would cut out."
"685","tt0037514","4478","4","The singing that Kelly and Sinatra do."
"686","tt0037514","4478","5","No."
"687","tt0037514","4478","6","The fabulous dancing that Kelly does."
"688","tt0037514","4478","7","No."
"689","tt0037514","4478","8","The time the movie takes to develop the story line and develop the relationships of the characters."
"690","tt0037514","4478","9","No that seems to be a common complaint many times that more recent movies don't develop the characters."
"691","tt0037514","4478","10","Some comment that Iturbi didn't bring much to the movie but this gives us a chance to see and hear a great talent from the 1040s."
"692","tt0037514","4478","11","So what if he wasn't an actor."
"693","tt0037514","4478","12","He was an important part of the movie as the basic plot was to get Grayson an audition with him."
"694","tt0037514","4478","13","Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star."
"695","tt0037514","4478","14","Louis B."
"696","tt0037514","4478","15","Mayer brought her to MGM for a screen test that included an aria."
"697","tt0037514","4478","16","During her audition in the movie there is a shot of the MGM brass nodding and smiling."
"698","tt0037514","4478","17","You can just imagine it was like that when she had made her real screen test years before."
"699","tt0037514","4478","18","This movie is so full of life it is hard to hit all of the highlights."
"700","tt0037514","4478","19","Great use was made of color and lighting throughout the movie."
"701","tt0037514","4478","20","You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did."
"702","tt0037514","4478","21","A nice counter point in the movie is how Sinatra a ladies man even then played the role of wanting to just find a date while on leave."
"703","tt0037514","4478","22","You'll feel good after seeing this movie."
"704","tt0037514","4478","23","7/10"
"705","tt0037514","4479","1","Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me."
"706","tt0037514","4479","2","At age 15, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals."
"707","tt0037514","4479","3","Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players."
"708","tt0037514","4479","4","Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance."
"709","tt0037514","4479","5","As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm up for On the Town."
"710","tt0037514","4479","6","Sinatra may have had to work hard at it, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and he would do better in their next pairings."
"711","tt0037514","4479","7","However, observing his physique, it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean."
"712","tt0037514","4479","8","Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat."
"713","tt0037514","4479","9","Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire."
"714","tt0037514","4479","10","Finally, it was strange to see the fresh faced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a ""thrill"" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold Loeb murder from the 1920s."
"715","tt0037514","4479","11","An additional note: One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest."
"716","tt0037514","4479","12","She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film."
"717","tt0037514","4480","1","In the Citadel film series book The Films of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical."
"718","tt0037514","4480","2","I sure can't do better than that."
"719","tt0037514","4480","3","It's such an important film in both the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra."
"720","tt0037514","4480","4","Kathryn Grayson didn't do too badly with this either."
"721","tt0037514","4480","5","Louis B."
"722","tt0037514","4480","6","Mayer had lent Gene Kelly out to Columbia where Harry Cohn had an inspiration to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it, Cover Girl became a classic."
"723","tt0037514","4480","7","So if Mayer didn't learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly artistic control."
"724","tt0037514","4480","8","When Anchors Aweigh was finished, Fred Astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance."
"725","tt0037514","4480","9","The main number everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse."
"726","tt0037514","4480","10","Originally Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney wasn't lending Mickey out to nobody."
"727","tt0037514","4480","11","Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit to do an outside film."
"728","tt0037514","4480","12","Not to worry because MGM had it's own animated rodent one half the team of Tom and Jerry."
"729","tt0037514","4480","13","Kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did Fred Astaire."
"730","tt0037514","4480","14","For the next dozen years, these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves weren't up to snuff."
"731","tt0037514","4480","15","It was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios."
"732","tt0037514","4480","16","In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit."
"733","tt0037514","4480","17","In fact Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning him is Oscar for From Here to Eternity."
"734","tt0037514","4480","18","When Frank Sinatra had half of his contract bought from RKO by MGM he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own."
"735","tt0037514","4480","19","He'd become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn."
"736","tt0037514","4480","20","In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells about how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film."
"737","tt0037514","4480","21","Louis B."
"738","tt0037514","4480","22","Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing."
"739","tt0037514","4480","23","One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I Fall in Love Too Easily."
"740","tt0037514","4480","24","Frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty Hollywood Bowl."
"741","tt0037514","4480","25","It's Sinatra at his best."
"742","tt0037514","4480","26","With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth than any other person."
"743","tt0037514","4480","27","They were lifetime friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone boost in his career."
"744","tt0037514","4480","28","On a bet Styne and Cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale."
"745","tt0037514","4480","29","They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings."
"746","tt0037514","4480","30","She also did some classical numbers."
"747","tt0037514","4480","31","Here singing in fact is the basis of the plot."
"748","tt0037514","4480","32","Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell."
"749","tt0037514","4480","33","Trying to fix her up with Sinatra, Kelly says he can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi."
"750","tt0037514","4480","34","They spend the film trying to accomplish just that."
"751","tt0037514","4480","35","My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays the waitress 'Brooklyn' never got a number herself."
"752","tt0037514","4480","36","She had gotten rave reviews from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood."
"753","tt0037514","4480","37","I have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in MGM's vaults it might still be."
"754","tt0037514","4480","38","Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals just aren't made any more."
"755","tt0037514","4480","39","All that creative talent was under contract to Metro Goldwyn Mayer."
"756","tt0037514","4480","40","If you had to pay market value for it, the cost might retire some third world country's debt."
"757","tt0037514","4480","41","But the film results would be extraordinary."
"758","tt0037514","4481","1","The only reason I give this movie 8/10 stars, and not 10, is because 1 Sinatra is awful and 2 the love interest of Kelly's character leaves much to be desired, IMHO."
"759","tt0037514","4481","2","Do love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap Al, is the little boy."
"760","tt0037514","4481","3","The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I have ever seen."
"761","tt0037514","4481","4","Tom and Jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter's."
"762","tt0037514","4481","5","I'm 28 and she's 4, so while the character is less iconic than Mickey, he is still a favorite of many children and adults today."
"763","tt0037514","4481","6","Kelly is as always captivating, his eyes full of fun and excitement."
"764","tt0037514","4481","7","In every movie I have ever seen him in, he always steals the show."
"765","tt0037514","4481","8","One of the best dancers of the 20th century."
"766","tt0037514","4481","9","It is no wonder Paula Abdul ""sampled"" Kelly's moves."
"767","tt0037514","4481","10","I would also list Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century."
"768","tt0037514","4481","11","If you were to watch only one part, don't miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse."
"769","tt0037514","4481","12","You will NOT be disappointed."
"770","tt0037514","4482","1","ANCHORS AWEIGH sees two eager young sailors, Joe Brady Gene Kelly and Clarence Doolittle/Brooklyn Frank Sinatra, get a special four day shore leave."
"771","tt0037514","4482","2","Eager to get to the girls, particularly Joe's Lola, neither Joe nor Brooklyn figure on the interruption of little Navy mad Donald Dean Stockwell and his Aunt Susie Kathryn Grayson."
"772","tt0037514","4482","3","Unexperienced in the ways of females and courting, Brooklyn quickly enlists Joe to help him win Aunt Susie over."
"773","tt0037514","4482","4","Along the way, however, Joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend."
"774","tt0037514","4482","5","How is Brooklyn going to take this betrayal."
"775","tt0037514","4482","6","And does Joe end up with Susie, who loves him too."
"776","tt0037514","4482","7","The first and second times I saw ANCHORS AWEIGH, I also saw it at the same time as I did ON THE TOWN, the Kelly/Sinatra collaboration from 1949."
"777","tt0037514","4482","8","Both times I felt that ANCHORS AWEIGH was the better film in terms of plotting and structure all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot, and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them."
"778","tt0037514","4482","9","Yet, both times I came away feeling that ON THE TOWN is the better film overall."
"779","tt0037514","4482","10","Having now seen both films a third time, I still stand by that judgement."
"780","tt0037514","4482","11","Somehow ON THE TOWN, as a film and a piece of entertainment, is just lighter, gayer, purely and simply happier."
"781","tt0037514","4482","12","The numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot, and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in ANCHORS AWEIGH."
"782","tt0037514","4482","13","I'm not quite sure why this is."
"783","tt0037514","4482","14","The typical argument is that the latter film is over long: at almost two and a half hours, this is certainly a valid criticism to make."
"784","tt0037514","4482","15","I certainly felt the length the first two times I saw it!"
"785","tt0037514","4482","16","However, it's also a film that grows on you the more you see it, the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making."
"786","tt0037514","4482","17","And yet, something just doesn't hang together quite right."
"787","tt0037514","4482","18","It feels almost as if the script was pored over, and every single moment when Kelly could break into dance or Sinatra into song was noted, and that's exactly what happened."
"788","tt0037514","4482","19","No opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up... and that's probably the film's biggest weakness."
"789","tt0037514","4482","20","It has 16 numbers give or take a few, and no matter how big a fan you are of Kelly or Sinatra, this really starts to turn one numb after a while."
"790","tt0037514","4482","21","Contrast this, for example, with the ten numbers in ON THE TOWN."
"791","tt0037514","4482","22","You might well feel that each song, each dance, can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking... and that's true."
"792","tt0037514","4482","23","But that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place."
"793","tt0037514","4482","24","All this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about ANCHORS AWEIGH."
"794","tt0037514","4482","25","The musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over, like the duets between Kelly and Sinatra 'We Hate To Leave', 'I Begged Her' and 'If You Knew Susie', the singing of Sinatra 'What Makes The Sunset', 'The Charm Of You', and the best of all, 'I Fall In Love Too Easily', and without a doubt the always inventive, always breathtaking dancing of Kelly."
"795","tt0037514","4482","26","It's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre."
"796","tt0037514","4482","27","Grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening; Jose Iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it; even Clarence's own Brooklyn, Pamela Britton, is cute and charming... as close as one could get to Betty Garrett without being Garrett herself!"
"797","tt0037514","4482","28","Sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his, and plays the innocent boy man wonderfully a role he reprises in ON THE TOWN."
"798","tt0037514","4482","29","His singing is, as usual, simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing."
"799","tt0037514","4482","30","His solo numbers might seem to drag a little, but when you've got the voice of a century, showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film!"
"800","tt0037514","4482","31","Gene Kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph."
"801","tt0037514","4482","32","Third in the billing behind Sinatra and Grayson respectively, ANCHORS AWEIGH really is Kelly's film."
"802","tt0037514","4482","33","His Joe Brady is a believable, real character he's tough on the outside, glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal, but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside."
"803","tt0037514","4482","34","Kelly makes this charming rather than cloying, but also gives Joe a real edge that you see in the scene when Joe chases Brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands."
"804","tt0037514","4482","35","And the dancing again, the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome, as it does with Sinatra's singing."
"805","tt0037514","4482","36","But once again, if it's Gene Kelly doing the softshoe, or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief... might as well err on the side of overdoing it!"
"806","tt0037514","4482","37","All of Kelly's dances are breathtaking, be it the pared down simplicity of his tap number with Sinatra to 'I Begged Her', his 'Mexican Hat Dance' with the sweet wide eyed little girl, or his lavish Spanish influenced dance 'La Cumparsita'."
"807","tt0037514","4482","38","Of course, the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be Kelly in his red, white and blue sailor suit, dancing with Jerry Mouse of 'Tom & Jerry' fame."
"808","tt0037514","4482","39","A well deserved golden film memory, to be sure it's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945, given the saturation of CGI in the contemporary film market."
"809","tt0037514","4482","40","But Gene and Jerry still look great, with Kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look."
"810","tt0037514","4482","41","It would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with Gene Kelly would be Kelly himself in COVER GIRL and a cartoon animation."
"811","tt0037514","4482","42","It's doubtless that this first daring, inventive Kelly dance with Jerry has reserved a place for ANCHORS AWEIGH in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs."
"812","tt0037514","4482","43","But it's also notable for being the first of three Kelly/Sinatra film collaborations, and though rather too drawn out, still a great couple of hours of entertainment."
"813","tt0037514","4482","44","Watch it first, then again and maybe again it'll grow on you before you realise it!"
"814","tt0037514","4482","45","7.5/10"
"815","tt0037514","4483","1","Everything a musical comedy should be."
"816","tt0037514","4483","2","Gene Kelly as Joe Brady doesn't miss a step, and Frank Sinatra as Clarence Doolittle doesn't miss a note."
"817","tt0037514","4483","3","Scenes with them together are very good, showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot."
"818","tt0037514","4483","4","Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future best."
"819","tt0037514","4483","5","Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is delightful."
"820","tt0037514","4483","6","Kelly certainly earned his nomination as Best Actor."
"821","tt0037514","4483","7","And there is a bushel of truly funny lines, like: ""You think the navy takes dopes."""
"822","tt0037514","4483","8","; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep.""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."""
"823","tt0037514","4483","9","A thoroughly enjoyable movie, just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded World War II."
"824","tt0037514","4484","1","Released some months before the end of the war, ""Anchors Aweigh"" is one of Gene Kelly's major musical triumphs of the forties Under the direction of George Sidney, it had the benefits of a pleasant score, andbest of allthe services of Gene Kelly in his first true starring role at MGM The year before, in Columbia's ""Cover Girl,"" he had revealed an innovative approach to dance on the screen, a light but agreeable singing voice, and considerable charm In ""Anchors Aweigh,"" although he was billed under Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson, he was laying the solid groundwork for his most revealing years at MGM The film's story, a kind of dry run for ""On the Town"" four years later, follows sailors Kelly and Sinatra on shore leave, spend their holiday in Hollywood, where they become involved in the affairs of an aspiring singer Grayson and her little nephew Dean Stockwell."
"825","tt0037514","4484","2","Grayson, it appears, has her heart set on an audition with conductor pianist Jose Iturbi She gets the audition, of course; Kelly gets Grayson after some misunderstandings; and Sinatra, has forgotten to be shy, and has lost his heart to a girl from Brooklyn Pamela Britton."
"826","tt0037514","4484","3","The plot is conventional for the period but, regrettably, it now seems barely tolerable But there is Gene Kelly, who dominates the movie with his agreeable personality Perhaps he grins too much, but when is permitted to dance, the film finally lifts off the ground ""I Begged Her,"" his early song and dance with Sinatra, is amusing and slightly absurd, in which he imagines himself as a bandit chieftain in a Spanish courtyard, courting maiden Grayson with a flamboyant flamenco dance and some athletic leaps He also does a charming Mexican dance with little Sharon McManus in the square of a Mexican settlement in Los Angeles The highlight of the movie, however, is Kelly's famous dance with the cartoon character Jerry the Mouse of ""Tom and Jerry"" fame."
"827","tt0037514","4484","4","Delightful and innovative, it skillfully combines live action and animation in its tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until Kelly, a sailor in the ""Pomeranian Navy,"" wearing a striped shirt and a beret, shows him how to dance ""Look at me, I'm dancin'!"""
"828","tt0037514","4484","5","says the gleeful mouse king..."
"829","tt0040613","1076","1","Super slick entertainment with a stellar cast, an outstanding script, and a firm grip on the approaching 1950's."
"830","tt0040613","1076","2","At the time, RKO was turning out classic noirs by the dozens."
"831","tt0040613","1076","3","But whatever the value of those shadowy downers, they reflected a war time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the Eisenhower era."
"832","tt0040613","1076","4","Few films of the late 40's are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy."
"833","tt0040613","1076","5","Jim Blandings Cary Grant works as an ad man on Madison Ave. where in his little daughter's words he sells things to people that they don't need, at prices they can't afford."
"834","tt0040613","1076","6","He's making good money, but like thousands of others, he's tired of living in a cramped urban ""cave""."
"835","tt0040613","1076","7","So, with wife Myrnah Loy, they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the Connecticutt countryside."
"836","tt0040613","1076","8","Needless to say, in the arms of nature, they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion."
"837","tt0040613","1076","9","There's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script."
"838","tt0040613","1076","10","I don't know if writers Panama and Frank got an Oscar, but they should have."
"839","tt0040613","1076","11","Of course, the humor revolves around all the problems that pop up when city people build a big house on rural land."
"840","tt0040613","1076","12","The annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage, with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving Grant a hard time."
"841","tt0040613","1076","13","Of course, no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than Grant, so it's just one well placed laugh after another, particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own."
"842","tt0040613","1076","14","Yet, oddly, the film appears to have no comedic high point."
"843","tt0040613","1076","15","Instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don't peak at any particular point."
"844","tt0040613","1076","16","That's a real movie triumph for any era."
"845","tt0040613","1076","17","Reaching back 60 years later, we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind."
"846","tt0040613","1076","18","With their live in maid, the Blandings may not be a typical American family, but that post war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical."
"847","tt0040613","1076","19","And what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than Blandings as an ""ad man"" tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more ""ham""."
"848","tt0040613","1076","20","More than anything, however, there's the movie's sunny optimism."
"849","tt0040613","1076","21","Oh sure, the feeling falters at times, yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the Blandings just stick to their dream carries them through."
"850","tt0040613","1076","22","Indeed, life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge, so I expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day."
"851","tt0040613","1076","23","It's that easily over looked subtext, along with the sheer entertainment value, that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post war period."
"852","tt0040613","1076","24","So, if you haven't seen it, catch it next time around."
"853","tt0040613","1077","1","This is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and ARE WE DONE YET., only points out all the more how the 40's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since, regretfully, been lost."
"854","tt0040613","1077","2","I was 15 when I first saw this and even at that tender age, there was much I could laugh at."
"855","tt0040613","1077","3","Now of course being familiar with adult frustrations, I see a whole lot that I missed as a youth."
"856","tt0040613","1077","4","The three main actors..."
"857","tt0040613","1077","5","Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas...interacted perfectly, but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream."
"858","tt0040613","1077","6","It's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions."
"859","tt0040613","1077","7","All in all, this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it."
"860","tt0040613","1078","1","Coinciding with the start of the baby boom, the years after World War II saw an unprecedented exodus of Americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes."
"861","tt0040613","1078","2","Directed by H.C."
"862","tt0040613","1078","3","Potter and co written by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank ""White Christmas"", this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well."
"863","tt0040613","1078","4","Of course, it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs  Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and an especially acerbic Melvyn Douglas  head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership."
"864","tt0040613","1078","5","Even though the film is sixty years old now, there is a timeless quality to the Blandings' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it."
"865","tt0040613","1078","6","Obviously, Hollywood thinks so since it's been remade at least twice first as a very physical Tom Hanks comedy, 1986's ""The Money Pit"", and again last year with Ice Cube's ""Are We Done Yet.""."
"866","tt0040613","1078","7","One look at HGTV's programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today."
"867","tt0040613","1078","8","The plot begins with ad man Jim Blandings, his wife Muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom one bath Manhattan apartment."
"868","tt0040613","1078","9","Rather than pursue Muriel's idea to renovate the apartment for $7,000, Jim sees a photo of a Connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move."
"869","tt0040613","1078","10","With the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend Bill Cole, the Blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair."
"870","tt0040613","1078","11","However, the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one."
"871","tt0040613","1078","12","This sparks the Blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first."
"872","tt0040613","1078","13","Costs rise with each new complication, tempers flare, and even a romantic triangle is imagined among, Jim, Muriel and Bill."
"873","tt0040613","1078","14","Priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not so blissful ignorance of the new homeowners."
"874","tt0040613","1078","15","With his double takes and flawless line delivery, Grant is infallible in this type of farce, and Jim Blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid career characters."
"875","tt0040613","1078","16","In a role originally meant for Irene Dunne, Myrna Loy shows why she was Hollywood's perfect wife."
"876","tt0040613","1078","17","She doesn't get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make Muriel an appealing character on her own."
"877","tt0040613","1078","18","Watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette."
"878","tt0040613","1078","19","As avuncular, pipe smoking Bill ""Cole Bill Cole"", Melvyn Douglas shows his natural, easy going élan as Grant's foil."
"879","tt0040613","1078","20","Smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by Harry Shannon as the laconic well digger Mr."
"880","tt0040613","1078","21","Tesander, Lurene Tuttle as Jim's officious assistant Mary, and Louise Beavers as the Blandings' lovable maid Gussie."
"881","tt0040613","1078","22","The 2004 DVD provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing Grant and Dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling Grant with his then wife, actress Betsy Drake."
"882","tt0040613","1078","23","A most appropriate 1949 cartoon, ""The House of Tomorrow"", is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house."
"883","tt0040613","1078","24","The original theatrical trailers for ten of Grant's film classics complete the extras."
"884","tt0040613","1079","1","Though not seen in too many films prior, you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since."
"885","tt0040613","1079","2","Not one of Grant's nor Loy's best films, they make an outstanding effort together."
"886","tt0040613","1079","3","After all, with that much talent and very good supporting cast, you know the laughs will be there."
"887","tt0040613","1079","4","The film is light, has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through."
"888","tt0040613","1079","5","A great example of classic American film fare that has stood the test of time."
"889","tt0040613","1079","6","Definite Saturday afternoon fare, heavy on the popcorn."
"890","tt0040613","1080","1","Movie ""comedies"" nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor, foul language, and groin kicking."
"891","tt0040613","1080","2","Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the undemanding and slow of brain."
"892","tt0040613","1080","3","Sure, an occasional good comedy will come along, but they're becoming rarer all the time."""
"893","tt0040613","1080","4","Mr."
"894","tt0040613","1080","5","Blandings Buildings his Dream House"" shows what 1940s Hollywood was capable of, and it's just screamingly funny."
"895","tt0040613","1080","6","Jim and Muriel Blandings Cary Grant and Myrna Loy decide to build a house in the Connecticut suburbs."
"896","tt0040613","1080","7","The film follows their story, beginning with house hunting trips, the house's riotous construction, all the way to the finished home with its ""zuzz zuzz water softener""."
"897","tt0040613","1080","8","Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course Grant is particularly funny as he watches the house's costs zoom out of control."
"898","tt0040613","1080","9","However, the film is stolen by the Blandings' wise attorney, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas."
"899","tt0040613","1080","10","Managing to steal every scene he's in, Douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the Blandings lurch from crisis to crisis."
"900","tt0040613","1080","11","Reginald Denny as the Blandings' harried architect and Harry Shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful."
"901","tt0040613","1080","12","I've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh."
"902","tt0040613","1080","13","I think it's a good film to watch when you need a lift, whether you're building a house or not."
"903","tt0040613","1081","1","One of the great classic comedies."
"904","tt0040613","1081","2","Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama."
"905","tt0040613","1081","3","A fun, satirical film, a buyers beware guide to a new home."
"906","tt0040613","1081","4","Filled with great characters all of whom, Cary Grant is convinced, are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home."
"907","tt0040613","1081","5","A great look at life in the late 40's."
"908","tt0040613","1082","1","Mr."
"909","tt0040613","1082","2","Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made!"
"910","tt0040613","1082","3","If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life movies made with wit, taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek, check this one out."
"911","tt0040613","1082","4","Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed."
"912","tt0040613","1082","5","Grant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire."
"913","tt0040613","1082","6","Loy is adorable as his pre NOW wife."
"914","tt0040613","1082","7","The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker."
"915","tt0040613","1082","8","Art Direction and Editing are way above par."
"916","tt0040613","1082","9","The movie never stoops to the low rent, by the numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit."
"917","tt0040613","1083","1","Another example of the unique talents of Cary Grant."
"918","tt0040613","1083","2","A performance worthy of Oscar consideration, yet once again shunned by the Academy."
"919","tt0040613","1083","3","Mr."
"920","tt0040613","1083","4","Grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city."
"921","tt0040613","1083","5","The pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis loosely for the more modern Tom Hanks vehicle, ""The Money Pit""."
"922","tt0040613","1083","6","If you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex, this movie is a must see."
"923","tt0040613","1084","1","Musings: Pure delight from beginning to end."
"924","tt0040613","1084","2","Not a laugh riot, but a more subtle, sophisticated humor."
"925","tt0040613","1084","3","What a goldmine of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr.."
"926","tt0040613","1084","4","Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed."
"927","tt0040613","1084","5","A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his ""lallies to be rabbeted"", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know."
"928","tt0040613","1084","6","Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative."
"929","tt0040613","1084","7","At that, Barker yells up to his mates, ""OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so...."
"930","tt0040613","1084","8","YANK 'EM OUT!"""
"931","tt0040613","1084","9","A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards."
"932","tt0040613","1084","10","All Grant can do is moan."
"933","tt0040613","1084","11","Yes, the movie IS dated."
"934","tt0040613","1084","12","You'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks."
"935","tt0040613","1084","13","A classic movie that is really a treasure."
"936","tt0040613","1085","1","This movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about Murphy's Law being applied to home ownership and construction."
"937","tt0040613","1085","2","If a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional."
"938","tt0040613","1085","3","Since it was set in the 'simpler' forties, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era."
"939","tt0040613","1085","4","Grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by Loy and Douglas."
"940","tt0040613","1085","5","Their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10."
"941","tt0040613","1086","1","This movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace."
"942","tt0040613","1086","2","While this makes it pretty different from the average Grant film, it is still highly watchable and entertaining."
"943","tt0040613","1086","3","It's sort of like someone said ""let's just follow Cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed""."
"944","tt0040613","1086","4","Considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well."
"945","tt0040613","1086","5","While the film has pretty modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material."
"946","tt0040613","1086","6","It's a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family."
"947","tt0040613","1087","1","There is so much to love in this darling little comedy."
"948","tt0040613","1087","2","Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just been short of space,will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled Mr."
"949","tt0040613","1087","3","Blanding."
"950","tt0040613","1087","4","Melvyn Douglas,with great comedic flare, both narrates and acts as the Blandings' attorney and voice of reason."
"951","tt0040613","1087","5","As well Myrna Loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife."
"952","tt0040613","1087","6","But the best performance is Grant's."
"953","tt0040613","1087","7","He is the American everyman, especially relevant at the time of this film's release, when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war."
"954","tt0040613","1087","8","The themes are universal,lack of money, work strain, fear of infidelity."
"955","tt0040613","1087","9","Yes, it does wrap up awfully neatly, but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending."
"956","tt0040613","1087","10","It is still relevant today, and I must chalk up the poor reviews I see to a present preference for dumbed down, gross out comedies."
"957","tt0040613","1087","11","The look of the film is slick, and there are some great bits of comedy is well, particularly toward the beginning."
"958","tt0040613","1087","12","While it may have lost some of it's social relevance, nearly sixty years after it's release, it is still a gem."
"959","tt0040613","1088","1","Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams."
"960","tt0040613","1088","2","It all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget."
"961","tt0040613","1088","3","There are many great laughs even if the story is somewhat thin sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s Hollywood comedy style."
"962","tt0040613","1088","4","A definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses, which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience."
"963","tt0040613","1088","5","As he makes his exit, he assures the client Grant that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $100.00 from the total...or at least $50.00...but certainly $25.00."
"964","tt0040613","1088","6","Hilarious!"
"965","tt0040613","1089","1","This movie was made in 1948, but it still rings true today."
"966","tt0040613","1089","2","Very, very funny."
"967","tt0040613","1089","3","It begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it ""builds"" from there."
"968","tt0040613","1089","4","Anyone who has ever built a house, will find this movie very endearing."
"969","tt0040613","1089","5","Great cast."
"970","tt0040613","1089","6","Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film."
"971","tt0040613","1089","7","This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's....clothing, architecture and family life."
"972","tt0040613","1089","8","Many references are made to the cost of things, and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing."
"973","tt0040613","1089","9","I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely."
"974","tt0040613","1089","10","I am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it."
"975","tt0040613","1089","11","A true classic."
"976","tt0040613","1090","1","One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr."
"977","tt0040613","1090","2","Blandings Builds His Dream House."
"978","tt0040613","1090","3","Although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today."
"979","tt0040613","1090","4","Still Cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of Wham."
"980","tt0040613","1090","5","What made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post World War II years."
"981","tt0040613","1090","6","Returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the GI Bill of Rights which included home loans."
"982","tt0040613","1090","7","The problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand."
"983","tt0040613","1090","8","Around the time the book by Eric Hodgins and the film were so popular Congress passed and President Truman signed the Taft Ellender Wagner Housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business."
"984","tt0040613","1090","9","I had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early Fifties."
"985","tt0040613","1090","10","Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city Rochester."
"986","tt0040613","1090","11","Their place wasn't quite as grand as a house in Connecticut with eighteen rooms, still they lived there the rest of their lives the way Cary and Myrna most likely did."
"987","tt0040613","1090","12","Of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners."
"988","tt0040613","1090","13","Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas around to offer counsel, usually too late."
"989","tt0040613","1090","14","Truth be told he's kind of sweet on Myrna and Cary knows it."
"990","tt0040613","1090","15","Myrna Loy's role is simply an extension of Nora Charles."
"991","tt0040613","1090","16","If you can imagine the Charles's moving to the country and William Powell having the headaches Cary Grant does, the film would still work just fine."
"992","tt0040613","1090","17","Mr."
"993","tt0040613","1090","18","Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as comedy because the situations are universal."
"994","tt0040613","1090","19","And this review is dedicated to my Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years."
"995","tt0040613","1091","1","I loved this film."
"996","tt0040613","1091","2","I first saw it when I was 20 which was only four years ago and I enjoyed it so much, I brought my own copy the next day."
"997","tt0040613","1091","3","The comedy is well played by all involved."
"998","tt0040613","1091","4","I always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where Mr."
"999","tt0040613","1091","5","Tsanders explains why he found water at 6 ft in one area and 227 feet in another area."
"1000","tt0040613","1091","6","Also look for Jason Robards father who plays Mr."
"1001","tt0040613","1091","7","Retch."
"1002","tt0040613","1091","8","Talent ran in that family."
"1003","tt0040613","1092","1","By the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over, as films were moving in a different direction, comedically and otherwise."
"1004","tt0040613","1092","2","With television looming on the horizon, Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time."
"1005","tt0040613","1092","3","Where, one wonders, would movies have gone had television not come along, or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years."
"1006","tt0040613","1092","4","Mr."
"1007","tt0040613","1092","5","Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed."
"1008","tt0040613","1092","6","Ad man Jim Blandings, along with his wife and two daughters, are living in a nice but way too cramped New York City apartment, as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs."
"1009","tt0040613","1092","7","So he buys some property in Connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications."
"1010","tt0040613","1092","8","Well, almost."
"1011","tt0040613","1092","9","Had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind."
"1012","tt0040613","1092","10","Then again he might not have."
"1013","tt0040613","1092","11","You decide."
"1014","tt0040613","1092","12","On this frail premise a wonderful film results, full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one."
"1015","tt0040613","1092","13","Nothing comes easy in this life, as Mr."
"1016","tt0040613","1092","14","Blandings learns; but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way."
"1017","tt0040613","1092","15","There is, after all, the long run."
"1018","tt0040613","1092","16","But, Blandings asks himself every few minutes, how long is long."
"1019","tt0040613","1092","17","This movie is a delight."
"1020","tt0040613","1092","18","It is not, I suppose, a masterpiece in the Capra McCarey tradition, but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures, and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically."
"1021","tt0040613","1092","19","There is real warmth in the picture, and a good deal of W.C."
"1022","tt0040613","1092","20","Fieldsian hard edged reality obtruding periodically, but not so much as to leave a bad taste."
"1023","tt0040613","1092","21","The people in the film are all very smart and affluent, but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class."
"1024","tt0040613","1092","22","Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr. and Mrs."
"1025","tt0040613","1092","23","Blandings to perfection; while Melvyn Douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend, who often has to bring up unpleasant topics, such as how the real world works."
"1026","tt0040613","1092","24","There is, too, a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia, which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years, as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place."
"1027","tt0040613","1092","25","These people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural Connecticut."
"1028","tt0040613","1092","26","In a few short years things would change, as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear, destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns, which soon would be connected by highways, littered with bottles and cans, their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city."
"1029","tt0040613","1093","1","I always enjoy this movie when it shows up on TV.The one scene that always stands out, for me that is, is the one with the Myrna Loy and the painters foreman, where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says ""Did you get that, that's yellow, blue, green and white"""
"1030","tt0040613","1094","1","This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and still laugh out loud."
"1031","tt0040613","1094","2","In other places, I have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious, politically correct prigs."
"1032","tt0040613","1094","3","There is neither here, unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid."
"1033","tt0040613","1094","4","The lines are hilarious, and all the leads have never been better."
"1034","tt0040613","1094","5","Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant."
"1035","tt0040613","1094","6","If you've ever thought of or tried to build a new house, you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process, no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel, you are not alone!"
"1036","tt0040613","1095","1","Great acting, great movie."
"1037","tt0040613","1095","2","If you are thinking of building see this movie first."
"1038","tt0040613","1095","3","The dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same."
"1039","tt0040613","1095","4","The humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt."
"1040","tt0040613","1096","1","I first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot."
"1041","tt0040613","1096","2","After many subsequent viewings and purchase of the video it still makes me laugh out loud."
"1042","tt0040613","1096","3","Yes, it's a relic of another age a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class America but well executed is well executed."
"1043","tt0040613","1096","4","But it's also a document of its age a celebration of post war optimism, the baby boom and the nascent consumer age."
"1044","tt0040613","1096","5","This film is no ""guilty"" pleasure."
"1045","tt0040613","1096","6","Three wonderful sophisticated leads actors urbane Melvyn Douglas; bemused Cary Grant; daffily determined Myrna Loy complement each other and a memorable team of characters."
"1046","tt0040613","1096","7","My favourite scenes ""It means we gotta blast"" and ""Miss Stellwaggen"" and ""This little piggy""."
"1047","tt0040613","1096","8","Love it."
"1048","tt0040613","1097","1","I stopped short of giving ""Mr."
"1049","tt0040613","1097","2","Blandings Builds His Dream House"" 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit: the fact that a black person is the faithful servant somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit."
"1050","tt0040613","1097","3","But other than that, the movie's a hoot."
"1051","tt0040613","1097","4","Portraying middle class New York couple Jim Cary Grant and Muriel Blandings Myrna Loy trying to build a house in Connecticut, this flick has something for everyone."
"1052","tt0040613","1097","5","Grant is his usual flippant self, while Loy does quite well as merely a wife."
"1053","tt0040613","1097","6","But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs as Jim's and Muriel's lawyer Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he's making clear."
"1054","tt0040613","1097","7","As for the house itself...throughout most of the movie, you'll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there."
"1055","tt0040613","1097","8","The builders, contractors, and others also provide their fair share of laughs."
"1056","tt0040613","1097","9","All in all, a comedy classic."
"1057","tt0040613","1097","10","Also starring Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr."
"1058","tt0040613","1098","1","Modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake, ""The Money Pit."""
"1059","tt0040613","1098","2","Older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas were all ""superstars"" in an easier, less complicated era."
"1060","tt0040613","1098","3","Or was it."
"1061","tt0040613","1098","4","Time, of course, has a way of modifying perspectives, and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary, there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older, seemingly less provocative films."
"1062","tt0040613","1098","5","In ""Mr."
"1063","tt0040613","1098","6","Blandings Builds His Dream House,"" there may, therefore, be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948."
"1064","tt0040613","1098","7","There is political commentary, however subtle."
"1065","tt0040613","1098","8","Finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience, only lightly softened by the coming of Levittowns and the like."
"1066","tt0040613","1098","9","Politics in the movie."
"1067","tt0040613","1098","10","The Blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school which in real life would get teachers accused of communism."
"1068","tt0040613","1098","11","In real life, too, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, a Democrat, and a feminist."
"1069","tt0040613","1098","12","Melvyn Douglas was no less a Democratic firebrand: he was married to congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whom young Richard Nixon accused of being soft on communism and which ruined her."
"1070","tt0040613","1098","13","Jason Robards, sr., has a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable."
"1071","tt0040613","1098","14","More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, jr., would be for many years a very active liberal Democrat."
"1072","tt0040613","1098","15","Almost the odd fellow out was Cary Grant, whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in Hollywood that was already slipping."
"1073","tt0040613","1098","16","But this was 1948: Communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner."
"1074","tt0040613","1098","17","It would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films, and then not so subtly."
"1075","tt0040613","1099","1","Although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built or bought to your specifications, it is not the first, nor the last."
"1076","tt0040613","1099","2","In 1940 Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE by George S."

"1078","tt0040613","1099","4","And about fifteen years ago Shelly Long and Tom Hanks had the lead in THE MONEY PIT."
"1079","tt0040613","1099","5","The former was about moving into an 18th Century country house that...err, needs work."
"1080","tt0040613","1099","6","The latter was about building your dream house in the late 1980s."
"1081","tt0040613","1099","7","Although the two films have their moments, both are not as good as BLANDINGS, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name."
"1082","tt0040613","1099","8","Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are noticing the tight corners of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall."
"1083","tt0040613","1099","9","Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising executive in 1948 he is making $15,000.00 a year, which was like making $90,000.00 today, and lives in a luxury apartment which in the New York City of that day he rents!"
"1084","tt0040613","1099","10","he feels they should seek something better."
"1085","tt0040613","1099","11","He and Muriel take a drive into the country Connecticut and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want."
"1086","tt0040613","1099","12","And they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to."
"1087","tt0040613","1099","13","For one thing, they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise, if cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole Melvin Douglas, in a nicely sardonic role."
"1088","tt0040613","1099","14","For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer Ian Wolfe, sucking his chops quietly, with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of Connecticut."
"1089","tt0040613","1099","15","Bill points out he's paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth."
"1090","tt0040613","1099","16","There are problems about water supply that both Blandings just never think about, such as hard and soft water which leads to the Zis Zis Water softening machine."
"1091","tt0040613","1099","17","They find that the designs they have in mind, and have worked out with their architect Reginald Denny, can't be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by Muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for."

"1093","tt0040613","1099","19","He has been appointed to handle the ""Wham"" account ""Spam"" had become a popular result of World War II, in that the public started using it as a meat substitute, in the light of it's success with the armed forces."
"1094","tt0040613","1099","20","Jim can't get a grip on this he's not alone one or two other executives fumbled it before him."
"1095","tt0040613","1099","21","He comes up with the following bit of ""poetry"".:""This little piggy went to market,He was pink and as pretty as ham."

"1097","tt0040613","1099","23","His Secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one!"
"1098","tt0040613","1099","24","Jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of Bill to Muriel, although in this case Bill is blameless."
"1099","tt0040613","1099","25","But he's always around Jim keeps forgetting that Bill is the clearheaded one, and that he's keeping Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes."

"1102","tt0040613","1099","28","He breaks a window, and the door opens by itself."
"1103","tt0040613","1099","29","The film works quite satisfactorily, with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves."
"1104","tt0040613","1099","30","It is one film which despite changing price levels and salary levels really does not age at all."

"1106","tt0040613","1099","32","A number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell regarding the paint job Parnell's company has to do on the various rooms."
"1107","tt0040613","1099","33","She carefully shows the distinct shades of red, blue, etc. she wants even giving a polite Parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue."
"1108","tt0040613","1099","34","The commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job."
"1109","tt0040613","1099","35","They proudly called Loy ""Mrs."

"1118","tt0040613","1100","7","What makes this movie so special is the three main actors Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas."
"1119","tt0040613","1100","8","Any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special."
"1120","tt0040613","1100","9","Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role."
"1121","tt0040613","1100","10","He is so good at playing the put upon husband."
"1122","tt0040613","1100","11","Loy is a always a joy to watch."
"1123","tt0040613","1100","12","The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect."
"1124","tt0040613","1100","13","And Douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years."
"1125","tt0040613","1100","14","Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, a particular favorite of mine."

"1128","tt0040613","1100","17","Throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live in maid and it becomes almost fanciful."
"1129","tt0040613","1100","18","However, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and predicaments the Blanding's find themselves in are easily relatable to today."
"1130","tt0040613","1100","19","And that's where the comedy comes in."
"1131","tt0040613","1100","20","How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected."
"1132","tt0040613","1100","21","The biggest complaint I have about Mr."
"1133","tt0040613","1100","22","Blandings is the whole ""wife in love with best friend"" subplot."
"1134","tt0040613","1100","23","It's really not necessary to the plot and feels out of place and very uncomfortable as presented."
"1135","tt0040613","1101","1","While the prices have gone up a lot, and some of the details have become dated, any homeowner who's struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie."

"1142","tt0040613","1101","8","Yet only a short distance away, a few days later, the basement of his house to be floods!"
"1143","tt0040613","1101","9","Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give believable performances as the harried Blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined, and Melvyn Douglas is even better as Blanding's lawyer and family friend."
"1144","tt0040613","1101","10","The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948."
"1145","tt0040613","1101","11","Mrs."
"1146","tt0040613","1101","12","Blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she's causing, and there's a black maid horrors!."
"1147","tt0040613","1101","13","So don't watch this movie through the social lens of 2003, and you'll enjoy it all the more."

"1155","tt0040613","1102","8","Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man moved by the impulse of accomplishing with the American Dream of owning a huge house that finds that made bad choice, while losing his touch in his work and feeling jealous of his friend."
"1156","tt0040613","1102","9","In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very funny movie visibly inspired in this delightful classic, ""The Money Pit""."

"1161","tt0040613","1103","3","This is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please."
"1162","tt0040613","1103","4","As a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining; and with major stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas... how could you go wrong."
"1163","tt0040613","1103","5","Comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued, and is very difficult to imitate."
"1164","tt0040613","1103","6","A good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long."
"1165","tt0040613","1103","7","Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments."

"1171","tt0040613","1104","5","One of three collaborations between Grant and Loy, this is a charming little comedy not very taxing, with no real great message, but a great way to spend an hour or two."
"1172","tt0040613","1104","6","The laughs are there right from the start, when the alarm clock goes off and Jim tries to shut it off, only to be thwarted at every turn by Muriel."
"1173","tt0040613","1104","7","The timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros, and that's just what Grant and Loy give us: polished performances, simple chemistry, and a lot of fun."
"1174","tt0040613","1104","8","Myrna Loy is in a pretty thankless role it's evident that Grant's character Jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting, and Grant, as always, pulls both off with remarkable aplomb, but she gives Muriel a colour, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give a character."
"1175","tt0040613","1104","9","Melvyn Douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well, never hitting a single wrong note."
"1176","tt0040613","1104","10","One of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when Bill gets himself locked in the 'store room', and Jim goes to 'save' him... only to get everyone trapped inside!"
"1177","tt0040613","1104","11","Every little problem that pops up for the Blandings renovation project including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for 'Wham' seems to bring together everything that could go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch."

"1185","tt0040613","1105","7","Obviously, a first time owner, Jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent."
"1186","tt0040613","1105","8","This is only the beginning of his problems."
"1187","tt0040613","1105","9","Whatever could be wrong, goes wrong."
"1188","tt0040613","1105","10","The architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn't work for the new house, after the original one is razed."
"1189","tt0040613","1105","11","As one problem leads to another, more money is necessary, and whatever was going to be the original cost, ends up in an inflated price that Jim could not really afford."
"1190","tt0040613","1105","12","The film is fun because of the three principals in it."
"1191","tt0040613","1105","13","Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of Jim Blandings."
"1192","tt0040613","1105","14","Myrna Loy, was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite Mr."
"1193","tt0040613","1105","15","Grant."
"1194","tt0040613","1105","16","The third character, Bill Cole, an old boyfriend of Myrna, turned lawyer for the Blandings, is suave and debonair, the way Melvin Douglas portrayed him."
"1195","tt0040613","1105","17","One of the Blandings girls, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Eva Marie Saint."
"1196","tt0040613","1105","18","The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but doesn't have much to do."
"1197","tt0040613","1105","19","The film is lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better."
"1198","tt0040613","1105","20","The direction of H.C."
"1199","tt0040613","1105","21","Potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies."
"1200","tt0042832","4909","1","Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be laughably bad, and laughably inaccurate examble: remember ""The Savage Bees""."
"1201","tt0042832","4909","2","But I'll make an exception for ""Tightrope"", which almost got it right."
"1202","tt0042832","4909","3","Here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong."
"1203","tt0042832","4909","4","The accents are not too bad yes, the ""yat"" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern, the city of 1950 is shown the way it is/was, without the obligatory ""tourist"" shots, and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a ""quirky southerner""."
"1204","tt0042832","4909","5","One of the few films to do justice to this city, and a good film to boot.."
"1205","tt0042832","4910","1","This very good movie crackles with tension."
"1206","tt0042832","4910","2","The stakes are, of course, high will the police and Widmark, the public health doctor, apprehend the criminals who don't know that they are carrying plague before a full scale epidemic breaks out."
"1207","tt0042832","4910","3","But smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene between Widmark and the police captain, between the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a dying plague stricken man whom Palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity, between Widmark and his wife, and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full scale panic."
"1208","tt0042832","4910","4","The movie is beautifully shot by Kazan, in extraordinarily well choreographed long takes shot on location in New Orleans, and ends in a stunning climax, where Palance flees like a rat from his pursuers, through the docks and warehouses of the city."
"1209","tt0042832","4910","5","The commentary is superb, probably the best that I've heard, covering the cinematography, the framing and lighting of shots, the production design, the casting of non professional actors in small roles, and the ironies and parallelisms in the plot, like an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally."
"1210","tt0042832","4910","6","Watch it once to enjoy the film on its own, and, if you are interested in film making, a second time with the commentary on to learn."
"1211","tt0042832","4911","1","This film has, over the past ten years, become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences."
"1212","tt0042832","4911","2","The three storyline threads given us by Kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures."
"1213","tt0042832","4911","3","The domestic chitchat between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between rooms, the small gestures such as the phone book Barbara places on the chair under her son so he can reach the table, those small intimate exchanges between husband and wife, all are well crafted and natural."
"1214","tt0042832","4911","4","More than anything else, I love their porch, that second living room where it is clear they spend much of their summer time."
"1215","tt0042832","4911","5","The second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film but especially between Widmark and Douglas' characters."
"1216","tt0042832","4911","6","It may not be totally original and does get a bit blustery but all in all, it comes across as real, respectful and efficient."
"1217","tt0042832","4911","7","The third thread,the grungy tale of Blackie and his tattered little gang, gets us closest to a dark and frightening noir world."
"1218","tt0042832","4911","8","Palance's Blackie is as cold as a block of ice."
"1219","tt0042832","4911","9","This self proclaimed business man, this self made man clearly has a complexity we only briefly tap in to."
"1220","tt0042832","4911","10","For me, this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience."
"1221","tt0042832","4912","1","One of America's most brilliant film directors was without question Elia Kazan."
"1222","tt0042832","4912","2","His directorial genius was not particularly suited to taut thrillers, since Kazan needed more room to breathe and to be slower and more subtle."
"1223","tt0042832","4912","3","However, 'Panic in the Streets' is a first rate social thriller and is if anything more relevant to today than it was to 1950 when it was released."
"1224","tt0042832","4912","4","The themes of illegal immigrants, people smuggling, imminent plagues, rapid transmission around the world of diseases a worried Richard Widmark says: 'I could be in any American city in ten hours and in Africa tomorrow.', ethnic isolation and ghettoism are today's concerns more than ever."
"1225","tt0042832","4912","5","This film features a spectacular film debut by Jack Palance, and a wonderful performance by Barbara Bel Geddes, two casting strokes of genius."
"1226","tt0042832","4912","6","Richard Widmark is allowed not to be a psychopath for once, and is a deeply caring, warmly loving, intense hero of the people."
"1227","tt0042832","4912","7","He leads basically a one man campaign to stop an epidemic of pneumonic plague in New Orleans, struggling to convince sluggish politicians and complacent policemen that there is a problem."
"1228","tt0042832","4912","8","There is a race against time to find the small time crooks who have contracted the plague from a dead illegal immigrant within 48 hours, before the whole city, and as they are always reminding us, the whole country, are endangered with the worst thing since the 1919 flu."
"1229","tt0042832","4912","9","One amazing scene where Jack Palance, who is infected, is prevented from climbing aboard a ship by a rat barrier on the rope is ironic in the extreme, reminding us in the most gruesome terms that humans can be the worst carriers and vermin of all."
"1230","tt0042832","4912","10","The highly dramatic chase scenes in what they call 'the coffee factory' at the wharfs rivals the most inventive climax scenes of Hitchcock, and with just as spectacular a setting."
"1231","tt0042832","4912","11","Many non professionals appear in the film, which has the gritty realism of, well, something called reality."
"1232","tt0042832","4912","12","Kazan really takes the cameras into places where even people rarely went, and where even rats would have thought twice."
"1233","tt0042832","4912","13","This film was a major feat of social realism."
"1234","tt0042832","4912","14","If it lacks the electricity of the most highly charged thrillers, it is because Kazan took it so seriously that he could not hype it up, for after all, the threat of plague is serious enough to scare anybody without the need for extra guns and molls."
"1235","tt0042832","4912","15","The only unfortunate thing about the film is the title, which gives a false suggestion of superficiality."
"1236","tt0042832","4912","16","But Kazan was anything but superficial."
"1237","tt0042832","4912","17","He clearly considered this project a public duty, to alert us to genuine possibilities."
"1238","tt0042832","4912","18","If only those possibilities had diminished today, but alas, they are getting worse every day."
"1239","tt0042832","4912","19","One day, after a worldwide plague, this film may be shown to a few survivors as an example of how an outbreak was contained on film, but its lessons were forgotten."
"1240","tt0042832","4913","1","The title overstates the content of this movie somewhat, which might lead to some unrealized expectations."
"1241","tt0042832","4913","2","Frankly speaking, there's very little ""panic in the streets"" to be seen here."
"1242","tt0042832","4913","3","In fact, throughout the movie very few people actually know that there's a murderer on the loose who may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters."
"1243","tt0042832","4913","4","Having said that, what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway because, unlike the people ""in the streets"", the viewer knows what's going on and that director Elia Kazan builds very deliberately."
"1244","tt0042832","4913","5","As the plague infected killer is sought, one of the more interesting sidebars I found was the developing relationship between Dr."
"1245","tt0042832","4913","6","Reed Richard Widmark and Police Captain Warren Paul Douglas."
"1246","tt0042832","4913","7","At the beginning, the two really don't like each other, even though they have to work together."
"1247","tt0042832","4913","8","By the end, they've forged a real bond of respect for each other."
"1248","tt0042832","4913","9","Kazan did a good job with that."
"1249","tt0042832","4913","10","Pretty much all the performances here were excellent."
"1250","tt0042832","4913","11","Widmark and Douglas were great, and I was quite taken with a very early look at Jack Palance playing what would become his typical ""heavy"" role."
"1251","tt0042832","4913","12","I found very little to criticize here."
"1252","tt0042832","4913","13","Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes came across as a little bit flat as Reed's wife Nancy, but her role wasn't really central to the story."
"1253","tt0042832","4913","14","All in all, an excellent piece of work."
"1254","tt0042832","4913","15","9/10"
"1255","tt0042832","4914","1","A small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store, and picking stuff just because I haven't seen it."
"1256","tt0042832","4914","2","A large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen."
"1257","tt0042832","4914","3","Long before Elia Kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies not good ones, he made this better than average drama."
"1258","tt0042832","4914","4","Watching it you begin to notice how many decent, good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated."
"1259","tt0042832","4914","5","Contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large... preferably large, and unsubtle, and scandalous."
"1260","tt0042832","4914","6","Kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director. um."
"1261","tt0042832","4914","7","No thanks His future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot."
"1262","tt0042832","4914","8","The plague is coming!"
"1263","tt0042832","4914","9","But here's an atypical Richard Widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope; here's an almost watchable Barabra bel Geddes, with her bathos turned way down well, for her; they're a couple and they share some nicely written scenes about big crises and smaller ones."
"1264","tt0042832","4914","10","Here's an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships crew; here's a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment."
"1265","tt0042832","4914","11","These are the small scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life; something Hollywood, in its greed, now studiously avoids."
"1266","tt0042832","4914","12","These are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them."
"1267","tt0042832","4914","13","It's a personable, human scaled film, not the grotesque, overscaled production that he and others David Lean will later popularize, whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as Pirates of the Caribean and Moulin Rouge."
"1268","tt0042832","4914","14","I just watched it twice and I'll be damned if I could tell you what Jack Palance is seeking in the final scenes, but it doesn't seem that important to me as a viewer."
"1269","tt0042832","4914","15","This reminds me of both No Way Out a Poitier noir with Widmark as the villain, and Naked City, which you should really get your hands on."
"1270","tt0042832","4915","1","And a rather Unexpected plot line too for the era: there is Plague in the City of New Orleans and only Richard Widmark can stop it!"
"1271","tt0042832","4915","2","Elia Kazan's trademark subjects: waterfronts, working men, crowds, fugitives, blue collar folk, violence on a backstreet are all showcased here."
"1272","tt0042832","4915","3","Jack Palance is quite effective as the ice cold mobster out for a big score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise somewhat miscast but certainly watchable as his go fer."
"1273","tt0042832","4915","4","I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as the stalwart, cool wife I thought she and Widmark were a believable couple."
"1274","tt0042832","4915","5","He himself always reminds me somewhat of Sinatra in the face and in the intense quiet manner and that is meant as a compliment if anything."
"1275","tt0042832","4915","6","I'd never even heard of this movie, and yes, you have to admire Widmark's performance."
"1276","tt0042832","4915","7","I also enjoyed Paul Douglas he seemed to play this role many times, they make an unlikely but effective team."
"1277","tt0042832","4915","8","The plague itself is a McGuffin and you gotta know it's not exactly done the way it would have been in Real Life rather small scale at the least no. but I found it carried the plot along nicely."
"1278","tt0042832","4915","9","Check this out."
"1279","tt0042832","4915","10","It's good.  outta"
"1280","tt0042832","4916","1","Plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan."
"1281","tt0042832","4916","2","Kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes."
"1282","tt0042832","4916","3","A man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game."
"1283","tt0042832","4916","4","It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact."
"1284","tt0042832","4916","5","City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease."
"1285","tt0042832","4916","6","A detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles."
"1286","tt0042832","4916","7","Streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community."
"1287","tt0042832","4916","8","Regardless of outcome, you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film's protagonist."
"1288","tt0042832","4916","9","Richard Widmark as Dr."
"1289","tt0042832","4916","10","Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers."
"1290","tt0042832","4916","11","Barbera Bel Geddis as Reed's wife has some good moments with Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of restful more than comic relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the New Orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer Joe McDonald."
"1291","tt0042832","4916","12","Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic."
"1292","tt0042832","4916","13","Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie Black Death. is simply outstanding."
"1293","tt0042832","4916","14","With riveting intensity Palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well."
"1294","tt0042832","4916","15","In addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity, especially in the film's powerful final allegorical moments."
"1295","tt0042832","4916","16","Panic in the Streets is probably Kazan's best non Brando film."
"1296","tt0042832","4916","17","It's tension filled, suspensefully well paced and edited."
"1297","tt0042832","4916","18","It's ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows Kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with Panic he succeeds with aplomb."
"1298","tt0042832","4917","1","'Panic in the Streets 1950' owes more to British noir that its American counterparts."
"1299","tt0042832","4917","2","Like Reed's 'The Third Man 1949' and Dassin's 'Night and the City 1950,' director Elia Kazan chose to film largely on location, capturing the fresh and vibrant decadence of the New Orleans slums."
"1300","tt0042832","4917","3","In a decision borrowed from the masters of Italian neorealism, he also hired many non professional actors for minor roles, lending an air of authenticity to the cityscape."
"1301","tt0042832","4917","4","However, any further comparisons with neorealism would be misguided, for 'Panic in the Streets' is pure melodrama, of the best kind."
"1302","tt0042832","4917","5","A murdered illegal immigrant, fished out of the bay, is found to be infected with pneumonic plague, a deadly air borne mutation of bubonic plague, which is transmitted from human to human and, untreated, has a mortality rate that approaches 100%."
"1303","tt0042832","4917","6","Clinton Reed Richard Widmark, an officer with the U.S."
"1304","tt0042832","4917","7","Public Health Service, convinces the doubtful police chief Paul Douglas to undertake a city wide manhunt for the men responsible for the homicide, lest they also be infected with the illness."
"1305","tt0042832","4917","8","In my younger years, I found Wolfgang Petersen's 'Outbreak 1995' to be among the most horrifying movies I'd ever seen."
"1306","tt0042832","4917","9","That thriller, which owes plenty to 'Panic in the Streets' working title: ""Outbreak"", terrified me so efficiently because it depicted the ebola virus as both an invisible and invincible killer  how does one defend themselves against such a thing."
"1307","tt0042832","4917","10","Kazan's film is the first that I know of to approach the subject of biological epidemics, though it has difficulty ascribing visual recognition to an enemy that is basically undetectable to the human eye; it instead uses Jack Palance as a human personification of the Plague."
"1308","tt0042832","4917","11","Despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society, you never get the sense that Clinton Reed is placing his own life at risk some viewers have noted that Reed never inoculated himself against the plague, though I think it's safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff."
"1309","tt0042832","4917","12","Nevertheless, there's still a strong sense of urgency in the hunt for the infected man's killers, underground street rats who pollute the sewers with their misdeeds."
"1310","tt0042832","4917","13","In medieval times, when the Black Death now widely believed to have been bubonic plague swept across the civilised world, killing a third of Europe's population, many identified the destruction as being the work of the Devil."
"1311","tt0042832","4917","14","Jack Palance's character, Blackie, serves effectively as Satan in human form: the angular jawed thug can occasionally be charming and charismatic, but is always liable to explode into fits of violence; his two hoodlums played by Guy Thomajan and Zero Mostel, through terror more than anything else, are constantly grovelling at his feet."
"1312","tt0042832","4917","15","When one lackey falls ill with fever, Blackie deduces that the man's immigrant cousin must have ""brought something in with him"" the irony of his conclusion not passing unnoticed, and so attempts to ascertain what this presumably valuable object must be."
"1313","tt0042832","4917","16","He cradles the dying Poldi in his arms, a grotesque display of faux affection that is both pathetic and unsettling."
"1314","tt0042832","4917","17","Blackie/Satan is finally stopped  not by the authorities, but by the burden of his own infection/evil  as he attempts to board a cargo ship, the primary vessel by which the Plague spread across Europe."
"1315","tt0042832","4918","1","As the film opens, two thugs kill another thug."
"1316","tt0042832","4918","2","When the body is discovered and about to be autopsied, the doctor realizes that although the man was shot dead, he was also suffering from the Pneumonic plague a very nasty and more virulent version of the Bubonic plague!"
"1317","tt0042832","4918","3","So, it's a race against time to find those who came in contact with the dead man and treat them immediately, otherwise a disaster could erupt."
"1318","tt0042832","4918","4","Oddly, I actually know quite a bit about the Pneumonic plague, as I taught a series of lectures on it for my history classes."
"1319","tt0042832","4918","5","The film really did not do a good job of getting the facts right about the disease in that it looked little like what the people had in the movie."
"1320","tt0042832","4918","6","The biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they really wouldn't have been allowed to show it."
"1321","tt0042832","4918","7","Sure, there is high fever and coughing they got this right but also lots of bleeding and explosive vomiting of blackened blood along with the enormously swollen lymph nodes like you'd get with the Bubonic plague all purply and gross!"
"1322","tt0042832","4918","8","I can certainly understand why they didn't go this far."
"1323","tt0042832","4918","9","Also, I am sure that the federal government would have had a much, much greater involvement in controlling and treating the disease here in the film it was handled on a very local level and everyone seemed ill prepared and a bit dumb."
"1324","tt0042832","4918","10","No one seemed willing to believe the doctors!!"
"1325","tt0042832","4918","11","As for the acting, the film had some excellent actors here."
"1326","tt0042832","4918","12","Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are, respectively, the public health doctor and police chief."
"1327","tt0042832","4918","13","Good actors but also known actors back in 1950."
"1328","tt0042832","4918","14","However, in his first film is the very menacing Jack Palance still going by his original moniker, 'Walter Jack Palance' as well as the relatively unknown at the time Zero Mostel."
"1329","tt0042832","4918","15","Palance was great very scary and very physically adept in his own stunts."
"1330","tt0042832","4918","16","Mostel played a heavy typical of his early work a greasy and cowardly sort of evil."
"1331","tt0042832","4918","17","Overall, despite really not getting the details right and wrapping everything up a little too neatly, the film is very tense and has excellent acting and is well worth seeing."
"1332","tt0042832","4919","1","Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar."
"1333","tt0042832","4919","2","Some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and rate it very highly."
"1334","tt0042832","4919","3","I can almost see where they are coming from."
"1335","tt0042832","4919","4","But I prefer to take a more toned down approach to a long forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi documentary fashion."
"1336","tt0042832","4919","5","Pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor Widmark and a city detective Douglas to apprehend the main carrier Palance."
"1337","tt0042832","4919","6","The film is moody, shot in stark black and white, and makes very good use of locations."
"1338","tt0042832","4919","7","Widmark is wonderful as usual."
"1339","tt0042832","4919","8","Forget the symbolism crime equals disease, and disease equals crime and just enjoy the chase."
"1340","tt0042832","4919","9","It is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short lived post WWII through the early 1950s and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher."
"1341","tt0042832","4919","10","For those who will be watching this for the first time, sit tight for the big chase at the end."
"1342","tt0042832","4919","11","It is something else, and frankly I don't know how they filmed some of it."
"1343","tt0042832","4919","12","I can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie."
"1344","tt0042832","4920","1","No, not really, but this is a very good film indeed, and is sadly a forgotten gem."
"1345","tt0042832","4920","2","Black and white suits the film."
"1346","tt0042832","4920","3","Straight forward formula, a guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before they die."
"1347","tt0042832","4920","4","Very well directed, and the acting is great."
"1348","tt0042832","4920","5","Richard Widmark as the male lead is good but is completely over shadowed in the acting stakes by Paul Douglas as the police captain, and Jack Palance never better than this and Zero Mostel as the baddies."
"1349","tt0042832","4920","6","Sadly Palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies."
"1350","tt0042832","4921","1","Like A Streetcar Named Desire also directed by Gadg both on stage and screen Panic In The Streets depicts a New Orleans in which its major claim to fame the birthplace of Jazz doesn't even rate a mention."
"1351","tt0042832","4921","2","It was Richard Widmark's seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer."
"1352","tt0042832","4921","3","Gadg himself appears in an uncredited small role as a morgue attendant but the film is rich in talent beginning with Jack Palance still being billed as Walter Jack Palanceas the local Mr 'Big' followed side kick Zero Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig plus the rock solid ever reliable Paul Douglas as the cop who comes round to doc Widmark's point of view."
"1353","tt0042832","4921","4","It's a very rewarding movie more so for being little seen."
"1354","tt0042832","4921","5","Catch it if you can."
"1355","tt0042832","4922","1","I wonder what audiences of the day thought when first laying eyes on Walter Jack Palance Blackie."
"1356","tt0042832","4922","2","Certainly he looks like no one else of the time, that skull like face, flattened nose, and elongated body even now he remains an unsettling presence."
"1357","tt0042832","4922","3","And what could be more appropriate than his emergence out of those dingy New Orleans slums that appear to fester like the plague Blackie is loosing on the city."
"1358","tt0042832","4922","4","I'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes."
"1359","tt0042832","4922","5","The movie itself is very skillfully assembled the morgue's black humor, the Widmark Douglas interplay, the un touristy locations, the battles among officialsall are woven into a tensely realistic thriller with a menace unlike others of the time."
"1360","tt0042832","4922","6","Even Widmark's domestic scenes that put a woman Bel Geddes on the marquee manage not to be too disruptive."
"1361","tt0042832","4922","7","Director Kazan certainly shows his aptitude for helming a studio Fox product, no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspect."
"1362","tt0042832","4922","8","Widmark does a solid low key job as the public health officer."
"1363","tt0042832","4922","9","But my money is on the one and only Zero Mostel."
"1364","tt0042832","4922","10","Was there ever a sweatier performer who could squeal louder or get pushed around more than the bulky fall guy e.g."
"1365","tt0042832","4922","11","The Enforcer, 1950."
"1366","tt0042832","4922","12","That scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with Mostel's shrewish wife Liswood, is a gem of frantic subservience as Mostel tries to pacify each like some berserk pinball."
"1367","tt0042832","4922","13","Too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist."
"1368","tt0042832","4922","14","I wonder if it was the voluble Kazan who named him."
"1369","tt0042832","4922","15","But it's not only the professionals that add color."
"1370","tt0042832","4922","16","The locals add both character and authenticity, especially the two Asian guys interviewed by the cops."
"1371","tt0042832","4922","17","That whole scene has an improvised air, as if Kazan recognized their potential and fashioned a nifty little scene on the spot."
"1372","tt0042832","4922","18","Then too, that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration."
"1373","tt0042832","4922","19","And what about those flea bitten coffee shops that have me running to the nearest Denny's."
"1374","tt0042832","4922","20","Anyway, the movie is still a well staged, riveting thriller with an apocalyptic air that oddly foreshadows many of today's mega hits."
"1375","tt0042832","4923","1","""Panic In The Streets"" is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director Elia Kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in New Orleans, using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation."
"1376","tt0042832","4923","2","As a result, the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable."
"1377","tt0042832","4923","3","An important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster, provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken, then increase the tension to a high level."
"1378","tt0042832","4923","4","Following a dispute between the participants in a card game, a man called Kochak Lewis Charles is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area."
"1379","tt0042832","4923","5","When the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus, U.S."
"1380","tt0042832","4923","6","Public Health official Dr Clinton Reed Richard Widmark is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague."
"1381","tt0042832","4923","7","Reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action, anyone infected could be expected to die within days."
"1382","tt0042832","4923","8","As the identity of the dead man is unknown, the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the Police Commissioner are not fully convinced by Reed's briefing."
"1383","tt0042832","4923","9","They doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently."
"1384","tt0042832","4923","10","The investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community, a group of seamen, the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man's identity and his contacts are eventually found."
"1385","tt0042832","4923","11","Kochak, an illegal immigrant, had been in a gang with Blackie Jack Palance, Raymond Fitch Zero Mostel and Vince Poldi Tommy Cook and when gang leader Blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation, he presumes that Kochak must've smuggled something very valuable into the country."
"1386","tt0042832","4923","12","As Kochak and Poldi were related, Blackie assumes that Poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more."
"1387","tt0042832","4923","13","Poldi, however, is very ill and unable to provide any information."
"1388","tt0042832","4923","14","Blackie brings in his own doctor and together with Fitch starts to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed and an exciting chase follows."
"1389","tt0042832","4923","15","Richard Widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man."
"1390","tt0042832","4923","16","In an unusual type of role for him, he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of Dr Reed very convincingly."
"1391","tt0042832","4923","17","Jack Palance's film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges Kochak's reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation."
"1392","tt0042832","4923","18","His distinctive looks also help to make his on screen presence even more compelling."
"1393","tt0042832","4923","19","In typical docu noir style, expressionist cinematography and neo realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place."
"1394","tt0042832","4923","20","Elia Kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside."
"1395","tt0042832","4924","1","A doctor and a policeman in New Orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague."
"1396","tt0042832","4924","2","An effective, and classy, little thriller directed by Elia Kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat."
"1397","tt0042832","4924","3","Set and filmed in and around New Orleans, Panic In The Streets is taken from the story Quarantine, Some Like 'em Cold by Edna and Edward Anhalt who won an Oscar for original story."
"1398","tt0042832","4924","4","It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director."
"1399","tt0042832","4924","5","In turn, Richard Widmark bringing the method a year before Marlon did for Kazan in A Streetcar Named Desire, Paul Douglas, Jack Palance as Walter Jack Palance & the wonderfully named Zero Mostel, all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential Black Death epidemic."
"1400","tt0042832","4924","6","Where the film scores its main suspense points is with Kazan's astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece."
"1401","tt0042832","4924","7","From Widmark's Public Health doctor, with hypodermic needle in hand, running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good; to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them; the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point."
"1402","tt0042832","4924","8","To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema."
"1403","tt0042832","4924","9","With Palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of Widmark's own Tommy Udo from Kiss Of Death three years prior."
"1404","tt0042832","4924","10","It's an imaginative and intelligently written story, one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease."
"1405","tt0042832","4924","11","A blight on society as it were."
"1406","tt0042832","4924","12","It's noirish elements, such as paranoia, blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being."
"1407","tt0042832","4924","13","While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created."
"1408","tt0042832","4924","14","Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway, this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end."
"1409","tt0042832","4924","15","Not essential film noir, and maybe not even essential Kazan, but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day."
"1410","tt0042832","4924","16","7.5/10"
"1411","tt0042832","4925","1","A neat 'race against time' premise A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them."
"1412","tt0042832","4925","2","This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it's well worth downloading."
"1413","tt0042832","4925","3","A lot all. of this movie was filmed in genuine New Orleans locations, which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail, though to me it does look under exposed, even for noir maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are."
"1414","tt0042832","4925","4","There is also a plenty of location background noise, which is slightly distracting car horns in the love scene, anyone."
"1415","tt0042832","4925","5","There are a lot of non professional supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with not much chance for retakes or recasting, though the final chase is worth hanging on for."
"1416","tt0042832","4925","6","There's not much wrong with the lead actors either: Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific, while Widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level most of the time."
"1417","tt0042832","4925","7","Somebody should remake this no supernaturals, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good yarn full of character conflict, and a topical theme."
"1418","tt0042832","4925","8","Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types peppering this dark, sleazy, against the clock drama."
"1419","tt0042832","4925","9","There's even a midget newspaper seller."""
"1420","tt0042832","4925","10","Community."
"1421","tt0042832","4925","11","What community."
"1422","tt0042832","4925","12","D'you think you're living in the Middle Ages."""
"1423","tt0042832","4926","1","Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors this country ever had, showed he was equally at home with movies."
"1424","tt0042832","4926","2","With ""Panic in the Streets"", Mr."
"1425","tt0042832","4926","3","Kazan gives us an early version of what would come later, with perhaps his master piece, ""On the Waterfront"", although both movies share only the water setting, for they are different visions about different subjects."
"1426","tt0042832","4926","4","Mr."
"1427","tt0042832","4926","5","Kazan shot on location in New Orleans."
"1428","tt0042832","4926","6","The adaptation by Daniel Fuchs of the Edna and Edward Anhalt stories that are the basis of the film, is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting ""The Big Easy""."
"1429","tt0042832","4926","7","One of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by Joseph MacDonald that shows New Orleans at its best."
"1430","tt0042832","4926","8","Also the music by Alfred Newman and the song by Billie Holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch."
"1431","tt0042832","4926","9","This film, could have been shot in New York, or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like ""broklynese"" than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country."
"1432","tt0042832","4926","10","One thing comes clear in the movie, Jack Palance, making his screen debut, smolders the screen every time one sees him."
"1433","tt0042832","4926","11","He was so intense!"
"1434","tt0042832","4926","12","At the same time, this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner, who unknown to him, is stricken with a fatal disease."
"1435","tt0042832","4926","13","Blackie, comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man's greasy hair with abandon."
"1436","tt0042832","4926","14","Notable also, was the fact that Mr."
"1437","tt0042832","4926","15","Palance and Mr."
"1438","tt0042832","4926","16","Mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts, something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real."
"1439","tt0042832","4926","17","The film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film."
"1440","tt0042832","4926","18","We see a family man painting furniture with his young son."
"1441","tt0042832","4926","19","Later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his salary, something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis."
"1442","tt0042832","4926","20","Richard Widmark, playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people."
"1443","tt0042832","4926","21","Barbara Bel Geddes, as the wife, sounds as though she's a suburban woman from Connecticut."
"1444","tt0042832","4926","22","The film is enjoyable thanks to Mr."
"1445","tt0042832","4926","23","Kazan's direction and the excellent cast working in the movie."
"1446","tt0042832","4927","1","Just a comment on New Orleans accents..."
"1447","tt0042832","4927","2","An earlier reviewer noted the following: ""This film, could have been shot in New York, or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like ""broklynese"" than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country."""
"1448","tt0042832","4927","3","There was also another comment along these lines from an English reviewer."
"1449","tt0042832","4927","4","Many people in New Orleans do, in fact, sound ""broklynese""."
"1450","tt0042832","4927","5","I have never found out why."
"1451","tt0042832","4927","6","It's mentioned in ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" by John Kennedy Toole."
"1452","tt0042832","4927","7","I always appreciate movies taking place in New Orleans that include this detail, as this one did."
"1453","tt0042832","4927","8","Too often it's just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent."
"1454","tt0042832","4928","1","Given its time of release, the story that unravels in 1950 thriller 'Panic in the Streets' was hardly a surprise."
"1455","tt0042832","4928","2","The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague."
"1456","tt0042832","4928","3","Yet with the current drama in the world today, this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers."
"1457","tt0042832","4928","4","The cast and crew are flawless."
"1458","tt0042832","4928","5","Richard Widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in 'Night and the City,' Jack Palance in his chilling film debut, also starring in this film are Paul Douglas and a young and rather cute Barbara Bel Geddes."
"1459","tt0042832","4928","6","A whole slew of uncredited, non professional actors typical of director Kazan fill in the remaining slots."
"1460","tt0042832","4928","7","Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald films he would later work with Richard Widmark again in 1953's much superior 'Pickup on South Street' and the great Alfred Newman scores it."
"1461","tt0042832","4928","8","Nearly everyone involved here has done better work, 'Panic in the Streets' is quite the rewarding watch, nonetheless."
"1462","tt0042832","4928","9","Especially for the film noir enthusiast."
"1463","tt0042832","4929","1","I can't really condemn the movie because it does work."
"1464","tt0042832","4929","2","There is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie, but I think it's only just in the category."
"1465","tt0042832","4929","3","There's nothing sinister in this piece, and that's where the noir elements fail."
"1466","tt0042832","4929","4","Sure, the disease might be considered sinister, but I have a hard time seeing that."
"1467","tt0042832","4929","5","The movie hints at a darker side: Blackie may be trafficking human beings, the New Orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter, the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie... but those are really only hints."
"1468","tt0042832","4929","6","There's no attempt made to question Reed's motivations, as one with do with Marlowe or Spade, nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to Blackie, which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played out."
"1469","tt0042832","4929","7","That lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end."
"1470","tt0042832","4929","8","The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and direction are well done... but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over."
"1471","tt0042832","4929","9","Worth watching once, maybe twice if you don't remember it from years ago, and then putting away."
"1472","tt0042832","4930","1","""Panic in the Streets"" was a decent thriller, but I felt a bit disappointed by it."
"1473","tt0042832","4930","2","The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never really explores or develops it."
"1474","tt0042832","4930","3","Its well made and entertaining, but its not as interesting as it should have been."
"1475","tt0042832","4930","4","The screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down."
"1476","tt0042832","4930","5","None of the central characters are really compelling or believable."
"1477","tt0042832","4930","6","Fortunately, the film is very well made so it compensates for the weak scripting."
"1478","tt0042832","4930","7","The direction by Elia Kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace."
"1479","tt0042832","4930","8","There are some standout sequences, particularly the memorable chase climax."
"1480","tt0042832","4930","9","When his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later, the man could mostly do no wrong."
"1481","tt0042832","4930","10","The acting is also very good."
"1482","tt0042832","4930","11","Richard Widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character."
"1483","tt0042832","4930","12","Paul Douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well."
"1484","tt0042832","4930","13","The standouts in the cast are the two villains."
"1485","tt0042832","4930","14","Zero Mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, is effectively slimy as one of cinema's ultimate toady characters."
"1486","tt0042832","4930","15","Jack Palance is, unsurprisingly, a chilling villain."
"1487","tt0042832","4930","16","""Panic in the Streets"" is disappointing but still worth watching."
"1488","tt0042832","4930","17","7/10"
"1489","tt0042832","4931","1","When plague breaks out in New Orleans, it's Richard Widmark to the rescue in ""Panic in the Streets,"" one of the lesser celebrated films of the great Elia Kazan."
"1490","tt0042832","4931","2","Kazan keeps the pace brisk, and there are lots of marvelous touches the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens, which is in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low lifes, portrayed by a menacing Jack Palance, his weak yes man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook, and Louis Charles."
"1491","tt0042832","4931","3","There are also some interesting visuals Palance has a couple of scenes with actors who seem to come up to his knees in height."
"1492","tt0042832","4931","4","The acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isn't quite up to the direction and performances."
"1493","tt0042832","4931","5","It has a few questionable aspects which will be spotted by the viewer quite easily."
"1494","tt0042832","4931","6","That aside, it's well worth viewing."
"1495","tt0042832","4931","7","Kazan was a masterful director."
"1496","tt0042832","4932","1","In Panic In The Streets Richard Widmark plays U.S."
"1497","tt0042832","4932","2","Navy doctor who has his week rudely interrupted with a corpse that contains plague."
"1498","tt0042832","4932","3","As cop Paul Douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest."
"1499","tt0042832","4932","4","That's not the issue here, the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease."
"1500","tt0042832","4932","5","As was pointed out by any number of people, for some reason director Elia Kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like they're from Louisiana."
"1501","tt0042832","4932","6","Having been to New Orleans where the story takes place I can personally attest to that."
"1502","tt0042832","4932","7","Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be excused because as a Navy doctor he could be assigned there, but for those that are natives it doesn't work."
"1503","tt0042832","4932","8","But with plague out there and the news being kept a secret, the New Orleans PD starts a dragnet of the city's underworld."
"1504","tt0042832","4932","9","The dead guy came off a ship from Europe and he had underworld connections."
"1505","tt0042832","4932","10","A New Orleans wise guy played by Jack Palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague symptoms."
"1506","tt0042832","4932","11","Palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received notice."
"1507","tt0042832","4932","12","Personally my favorite in this film is Zero Mostel."
"1508","tt0042832","4932","13","This happened right before Mostel was blacklisted and around that time he made a specialty of playing would be tough guys who are really toadies."
"1509","tt0042832","4932","14","He plays the same kind of role in the Humphrey Bogart film, The Enforcer."
"1510","tt0042832","4932","15","Sadly I can kind of identify with Mostel in that last chase scene where he and Palance are being chased down by Widmark, Douglas, and half the New Orleans Police."
"1511","tt0042832","4932","16","Seeing the weight challenged Zero trying to keep up with Palance was something else because I'm kind of in Zero's league now in the heft department."
"1512","tt0042832","4932","17","Kazan kept the action going at a good clip, there's very little down time in this film."
"1513","tt0042832","4932","18","If there was any less it would be an Indiana Jones film."
"1514","tt0042832","4932","19","Panic In The Streets won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay that year."
"1515","tt0042832","4932","20","Kazan also made good use of the New Orleans waterfront and the French Quarter."
"1516","tt0042832","4932","21","Some of the same kinds of shots are later used in On the Waterfront."
"1517","tt0042832","4932","22","In fact Panic In The Streets is about people not squealing when they really should in their own best interest."
"1518","tt0042832","4932","23","Very similar again to On the Waterfront."
"1519","tt0042832","4932","24","Panic In The Streets does everyone proud who was associated with it."
"1520","tt0042832","4932","25","Now why couldn't Elia Kazan get some decent New Orleans sounding people in the small roles."
"1521","tt0042832","4933","1","Refreshing `lost' gem!"
"1522","tt0042832","4933","2","Featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them."
"1523","tt0042832","4933","3","The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes."
"1524","tt0042832","4933","4","Palance is his usual evil presence."
"1525","tt0042832","4933","5","Widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene, a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a `logical' end, and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary Hollywood."
"1526","tt0042832","4933","6","You know how it will likely end, but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout."
"1527","tt0042832","4933","7","The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see."
"1528","tt0042832","4933","8","The film seems to slow a little past the middle, but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion."
"1529","tt0042832","4934","1","""Panic in the Streets"" is a fairly unknown little movie from director Elia Kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", ""On the Waterfront"" and ""East of Eden""."
"1530","tt0042832","4934","2","Kazan already won an Oscar in 1947, before this movie, so he was not a completely unknown at the time."
"1531","tt0042832","4934","3","Still ""Panic in the Streets"" is mostly a movie that passed under the radar."
"1532","tt0042832","4934","4","The great thing about this movie is the Oscar winning script."
"1533","tt0042832","4934","5","It has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime/film noir elements."
"1534","tt0042832","4934","6","The dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent and gives the movie a feel of reality and credibility."
"1535","tt0042832","4934","7","The cast is fairly unknown especially at the time it was released but it still features Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first movie roles."
"1536","tt0042832","4934","8","Especially Palance impresses as the tough gangster boss, with a very powerful looking face."
"1537","tt0042832","4934","9","Still the movie drags a little at some points."
"1538","tt0042832","4934","10","The movie starts of very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always makes the right decisions in terms of pace and the point of view the story is told from."
"1539","tt0042832","4934","11","Yet, ""Panic in the Streets"" remains a perfectly watchable movie, mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch."
"1540","tt0042832","4934","12","For fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch.8/10"

"1549","tt0042832","4935","9","The engaging plot has not become dated after fifty seven years."
"1550","tt0042832","4935","10","Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive."

"1558","tt0042832","4936","6","While Panic in the Streets is a quality film, it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling my reason for bringing the score down to an eight."
"1559","tt0042832","4936","7","It wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster, police procedural, thriller and even romance."
"1560","tt0042832","4936","8","This is not director Elia Kazan's best work, but saying that is a bit disingenuous."
"1561","tt0042832","4936","9","Kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire 1951, On The Waterfront 1954 and East of Eden 1955, after all."
"1562","tt0042832","4936","10","This film predates those, but Kazan has said that he was already ""untethered"" by the studio."
"1563","tt0042832","4936","11","Taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl."
"1564","tt0042832","4936","12","The film is set in New Orleans, a city where Kazan ""used to wander around . . . night and day so I knew it well""."
"1565","tt0042832","4936","13","He wanted to exploit the environment."
"1566","tt0042832","4936","14","""It's so terrific and colorful."
"1567","tt0042832","4936","15","I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints all of New Orleans""."
"1568","tt0042832","4936","16","Kazan handles each genre of Panic in the Streets well, but they could be connected better."
"1569","tt0042832","4936","17","The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods."
"1570","tt0042832","4936","18","The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked."
"1571","tt0042832","4936","19","Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, ""Quarantine"" and ""Some Like 'Em Cold""."
"1572","tt0042832","4936","20","The gangster material, which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film, is probably the highlight."
"1573","tt0042832","4936","21","Not surprisingly, Kazan has said that he believes the villains are ""more colorful I never had much affection for the good guys anyway."
"1574","tt0042832","4936","22","I don't like puritans""."
"1575","tt0042832","4936","23","A close second is the only material that approaches the ""panic"" of the title the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed, inoculate them and contain the disease."
"1576","tt0042832","4936","24","While there is plenty of suspense during these two ""moods"", much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama, with pacing more typical of that genre."
"1577","tt0042832","4936","25","The dialogue throughout is excellent."
"1578","tt0042832","4936","26","The stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced."
"1579","tt0042832","4936","27","It is intelligent, delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character."
"1580","tt0042832","4936","28","Conflict isn't created by ""dumb"" decisions but smart moves; events and characters' actions are more like a chess game."
"1581","tt0042832","4936","29","When unusual stances are taken, such as Reed withholding the plague from the newspapers, he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions, which other characters argue over."
"1582","tt0042832","4936","30","In light of this, it's interesting that Kazan believed that ""propriety, religion, ethics and the middle class are all murdering us""."
"1583","tt0042832","4936","31","That idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm, or allowances away from it, made by the protagonists."
"1584","tt0042832","4936","32","For example, head gangster Blackie Jack Palance in his first film role is offered a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card if he'll cooperate with combating the plague."
"1585","tt0042832","4936","33","The technical aspects of the film are fine, if nothing exceptional, but the real reasons to watch are the performances, the intriguing scenario and the well written dialogue."
"1586","tt0042832","4937","1","This film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio terrorism, and the threats of superbugs, West Nile Virus, and SARS."
"1587","tt0042832","4937","2","As a thriller, the tension is fairly intense."
"1588","tt0042832","4937","3","Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than serviceable in their roles."
"1589","tt0042832","4937","4","The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot."
"1590","tt0042832","4937","5","The actor in this film who most left his mark is Jack Palance."
"1591","tt0042832","4937","6","His sharply defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface."
"1592","tt0042832","4937","7","The chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today."
"1593","tt0042832","4937","8","Recommended, 7/10."
"1594","tt0042832","4938","1","Panic In The Streets opens in high noir style, a view along a dark street followed by a camera tilt upwards to a window, behind which is playing out a sleazy card game an opening flourish which, along with some of the location shooting, anticipates some of the atmosphere Welles brought a decade later in Touch Of Evil."
"1595","tt0042832","4938","2","One of the players throws open the window; it's an appropriate action, serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworld."
"1596","tt0042832","4938","3","Shot in high contrast black and white, Panic In The Streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in New Orleans."
"1597","tt0042832","4938","4","Scenes set in such places as the mortuary, the crowded shipping office or amidst the peeling paint of 'Frank's Place' offer a unique, and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere, impossible to recreate in the studio."
"1598","tt0042832","4938","5","With these elements, Kazan's film shows the influence of Dassin's groundbreaking Naked City of two years earlier, which established the gritty, almost documentary style within the noir cycle."
"1599","tt0042832","4938","6","In fact, Widmark's previous role had been in Dassin's even finer Night And The City, a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent."
"1600","tt0042832","4938","7","Joe MacDonald, a favourite with the director, photographed Panic In The Streets' detailed environment."
"1601","tt0042832","4938","8","MacDonald also worked on Kazan's Pinky and Viva Zapata!, and went on to shoot Widmark again three years later in Fuller's masterpiece Pick Up On South Street."
"1602","tt0042832","4938","9","As others have noticed, in a manner typical of some noir films, Kazan's work offers a contrast between the confusion, sickness and immorality of the streets with the modest, calm home life of the Reeds."
"1603","tt0042832","4938","10","But whereas for instance in Lang's The Big Heat 1953 the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the embattled central character ultimately sending him back to work with an increased vigilance and sense of vengeance Panic In The Streets places Reed's rising anxiousness within the confines of what amounts to just another working 'day'."
"1604","tt0042832","4938","11","Despite all the danger, ultimately he returns back to the bosom of his family justified and satisfied."
"1605","tt0042832","4938","12","The implication being that social balance has been restored, at least for the moment by his professionalism and curative skills."
"1606","tt0042832","4938","13","That imbalance of course, has been created by crime and disease."
"1607","tt0042832","4938","14","The two are closely associated in this film."
"1608","tt0042832","4938","15","It reminds one of the tagline from the much cruder Cobra 1986 where ""Crime is the disease."
"1609","tt0042832","4938","16","Meet the cure,"" a neat analogy in context, if one which rings too uncomfortably of social reductionism."
"1610","tt0042832","4938","17","At its climax, as Blackie attempts to flee aboard ship, the visuals specifically allude to rats as being similar to criminals, both posing a menace to society's health."
"1611","tt0042832","4938","18","As the presumably infected Blackie prowls round the cheap rooms and the docks with his cronies, in search of something he suspects everyone is after, if without knowing exactly what it is, 'plague' and 'Blackie' resonate together in the audiences mind, adding further to connected associations."
"1612","tt0042832","4938","19","Ironically Blackie's hunch about Poldi's unfortunate cousin, that ""he brought something in"" of note is correct even if, finally, its nothing he can sell or steal."
"1613","tt0042832","4938","20","Blackie's logical assumption that the police would not normally bother with the murder of some anonymous illegal immigrant has a ring of truth about it, and his so confusion is understandable."
"1614","tt0042832","4938","21","Dr Reed, although home loving, and on the side of society, is a true noir hero."
"1615","tt0042832","4938","22","Familiar to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man who walks alone, forced to travel beyond the limits of the law."
"1616","tt0042832","4938","23","In his way, Reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society at large a dimension of the film that is particularly apposite, given director Kazan's controversial personal history."
"1617","tt0042832","4938","24","The director testified before the infamous HUAC, naming suspected communists and fellow travellers."
"1618","tt0042832","4938","25","His film depicts suspects being hauled in for questioning, and the manhandling of the press, on the grounds that the overriding public good justified the means."
"1619","tt0042832","4938","26","These actions perhaps echo the director's sentiments at the time, presumably accepting the McCarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights it entailed in the light of presumed communist infiltration of the entertainment industry."
"1620","tt0042832","4938","27","In these times of terrorist threats and state response, such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modern."
"1621","tt0042832","4938","28","Standout scenes in the film include a notable scene where Blackie interrogates the dying Poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin's presumed contraband."
"1622","tt0042832","4938","29","Cat like, Blackie stalks his victim across the room, eventually preying over the doomed man's sick bed, holding Poldi's feverish head in his hands a striking, evil cradling."
"1623","tt0042832","4938","30","It's a gesture emphasising the intimate nature of corruption, whether moral or physical."
"1624","tt0042832","4938","31","Apparently, the actors did many or all of their own stunts, which leads to some other, very dramatic scenes at the end, as the police and health authorities close in on the villains under the wharfs."
"1625","tt0042832","4938","32","Half crawling, half scrambling over the slippery timbers at the edge of the dock pool must have been an experience very uncomfortable for Palance, but it is sequence that adds immensely to the immediacy of it all."
"1626","tt0042832","4938","33","Occasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer."
"1627","tt0042832","4938","34","Apparently Dr Reed is left to fight a potential national emergency little government backup."
"1628","tt0042832","4938","35","Perhaps just as astonishingly, he never inoculates himself inviting a dramatic turn which never materialises."
"1629","tt0042832","4938","36","At the end of the film, too, the potential epidemic has been halted, all contactees located, a little too neatly."
"1630","tt0042832","4938","37","But these weaknesses are more than outweighed by the other satisfactions of a film that still makes for compulsive and relevant viewing today."
"1631","tt0046187","4187","1","This is a pretty decent example of film noir."
"1632","tt0046187","4187","2","The setting is the early 50's with the Communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the US Government."
"1633","tt0046187","4187","3","Richard Widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples."
"1634","tt0046187","4187","4","He gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing A List about him."
"1635","tt0046187","4187","5","The interesting thing was that he was not only an anti hero but through most of the film, an unlikeable anti hero."
"1636","tt0046187","4187","6","That is not very normal."
"1637","tt0046187","4187","7","Jean Peters gave a so so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold."
"1638","tt0046187","4187","8","That great character actress Thelma Ritter shines as the stool pigeon."
"1639","tt0046187","4187","9","The plot had its fair share of twists and turns, wisecracks and tough talk."
"1640","tt0046187","4187","10","There is a fight scene near the end of the movie in the subway station that was pretty gritty and exciting."
"1641","tt0046187","4187","11","I think noir fans like myself will enjoy this film."
"1642","tt0046187","4187","12","For non noir viewers, it may seem a little dated and the whole Commie thing a tad overdone."
"1643","tt0046187","4188","1","Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films."
"1644","tt0046187","4188","2","While ""Shock Corridor"" and ""The Naked Kiss"" represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of America and ""The Big Red One"" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, ""Merrill's Marauders"" painted war as necessary hell and ""Pickup on South Street"" is about the dangers of communist spies."
"1645","tt0046187","4188","3","All of his films make for very entertaining viewing, and even though he was often pigeonholed as a b filmmaker, Fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors."
"1646","tt0046187","4188","4","""Pickup on South Street"" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the film making style is remarkably ahead of its time."
"1647","tt0046187","4188","5","Its also a very quickly pace, tight, and occasionally brutal film noir."
"1648","tt0046187","4188","6","The acting across the board is fantastic."
"1649","tt0046187","4188","7","Richard Widmark makes for a great anti hero and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend."
"1650","tt0046187","4188","8","The show stealer is Thlema Ritter however, in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie."
"1651","tt0046187","4188","9","The angles Fuller employs are great, making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal this is very violent for its time."
"1652","tt0046187","4188","10","The camera continuously moves around just as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later."
"1653","tt0046187","4188","11","""Pickup on South Street"" is a great action paced noir thriller."
"1654","tt0046187","4188","12","""Shock Corridor"" remains my favorite Fuller film, but this is a very close second."
"1655","tt0046187","4188","13","8/10"
"1656","tt0046187","4189","1","Richard Widmark is a tainted character in this movie."
"1657","tt0046187","4189","2","He is a professional pickpocket."
"1658","tt0046187","4189","3","He's been in prison three times, yet at the beginning of the film, he tries to make it four."
"1659","tt0046187","4189","4","Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody."
"1660","tt0046187","4189","5","Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark."
"1661","tt0046187","4189","6","This is a period piece during the McCarthy era where the Red Scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely."
"1662","tt0046187","4189","7","What is unusual about this film is that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films."
"1663","tt0046187","4189","8","This is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film."
"1664","tt0046187","4189","9","The film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as the under card for double features in the theater."
"1665","tt0046187","4189","10","The sets show it is a limited budget film."
"1666","tt0046187","4189","11","The script made J Edgar Hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift."
"1667","tt0046187","4189","12","Hoover wanted it changed."
"1668","tt0046187","4189","13","Instead, it became a B under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953."
"1669","tt0046187","4189","14","The script & acting in it are better than other big features were that year."
"1670","tt0046187","4190","1","Thelma Ritter did steal the picture."
"1671","tt0046187","4190","2","I just finished watching it again."
"1672","tt0046187","4190","3","I couldn't help becoming emotional in her final scene."
"1673","tt0046187","4190","4","She didn't get the Oscar."
"1674","tt0046187","4190","5","That's why you shouldn't put too much faith in Oscars."
"1675","tt0046187","4190","6","Richard Widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3 D, flawed human being."
"1676","tt0046187","4190","7","Jean Peters was great as the streetwise, tough girl in her best role ever."
"1677","tt0046187","4190","8","And Richard Kiley must have been very good; why else would I have hated him so."
"1678","tt0046187","4190","9","Yes, it was heavy handed on the patriotism; but, without it, you don't have much of a film."
"1679","tt0046187","4190","10","Watch their faces!"
"1680","tt0046187","4190","11","The top three stars didn't really need much script."
"1681","tt0046187","4190","12","I would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue."
"1682","tt0046187","4190","13","If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in ""The Thief"", maybe you know what I mean."
"1683","tt0046187","4190","14","When I was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to NYC, I made my Bronx uncle drive us to the foot of South Street looking for No."
"1684","tt0046187","4190","15","66."
"1685","tt0046187","4190","16","That's when I knew that Hollywood couldn't be trusted."
"1686","tt0046187","4190","17","But I did find the river."
"1687","tt0046187","4190","18","I'm not giving away much of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it for myself."
"1688","tt0046187","4190","19","If you have seen it, no elucidation is necessary."
"1689","tt0046187","4190","20","Just maybe, someone who is reading these comments hasn't seen ""Pickup On South Street""."
"1690","tt0046187","4190","21","You will like it; just don't go looking for 66 South Street in New York City."
"1691","tt0046187","4191","1","This 1953 Sam Fuller movie contains some of his best work, and its sad that he couldn't continue to get the backing of major Hollywood studios to do his stuff."
"1692","tt0046187","4191","2","The story line goes something like this."
"1693","tt0046187","4191","3","A tough hard broad read prostitute is riding the subway one hot summer day, and gets her pocketbook picked by Skip McCoy."
"1694","tt0046187","4191","4","What Skip and the dame don't realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spies."
"1695","tt0046187","4191","5","This opening shot without dialogue, and mostly in tight close ups is a beaut,one of the many that Fuller uses throughout the movie."
"1696","tt0046187","4191","6","Playing the babe known as Candy is Jean Peters, who was never better nor better looking."
"1697","tt0046187","4191","7","One forgets how beautiful she was, and she handles this role very well."
"1698","tt0046187","4191","8","The Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark, who had already made his mark, and set his style with 1947's Kiss Of Death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh, and although he's a little ""softer"" here, he's still scary."
"1699","tt0046187","4191","9","These hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there, but its noir and nasty all the way."
"1700","tt0046187","4191","10","The standout performance belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter,who plays Moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral."
"1701","tt0046187","4191","11","Ritter received a well deserved Oscar nomination for her performance, but lost out to the boring but popular performance of Donna Reed as the B girl read prostitute in ""From Here To Eternity."""
"1702","tt0046187","4191","12","Hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad, and loves to Oscar them even though their performance is usually awful."
"1703","tt0046187","4191","13","See for instance Shirley Jones in ""Elmer Gantry."
"1704","tt0046187","4191","14","Set among the docks and dives of New York City, with crisp black and white photography by the great Joe MacDonald,and some very good art direction."
"1705","tt0046187","4191","15","Especially good is the set representing the New York City subways and Widmark's shack near the river."
"1706","tt0046187","4191","16","Made at the height of the cold war and red scare, the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie, played by Richard Kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal American."
"1707","tt0046187","4192","1","In what will probably find itself on my list of Fuller's best movies that is, once I see more of them that just this and Shock Corridor, Pickup on South Street is a film noir where the femme fatale, as well as the male protagonist, are not the stereotypical ones in the genre."
"1708","tt0046187","4192","2","Like most of his other works, Fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of New York style that is usually absent in the Hollywood noirs."
"1709","tt0046187","4192","3","On a small budget at least for the likes of Darryl F."
"1710","tt0046187","4192","4","Zanuck Fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere."
"1711","tt0046187","4192","5","The good guys are basically the ones who won't get violent with you even as they're looking for an extra buck."
"1712","tt0046187","4192","6","Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter are all terrific in the lead parts."
"1713","tt0046187","4192","7","Widmark is one only a few actors I can think of who could've really pulled off this character."
"1714","tt0046187","4192","8","He's a little like Bugs Bunny, as he can be a wise ass who is a little sneaky."
"1715","tt0046187","4192","9","On the other hand, the character of Skip McCoy does have a set of values in his life."
"1716","tt0046187","4192","10","He doesn't go into other people's affairs, and doesn't try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river, after being sent away for three years."
"1717","tt0046187","4192","11","He slips up, unbeknownst to him, when he pickpockets a woman Peters on the train, and lifts an item that's under the eye of the Government."
"1718","tt0046187","4192","12","It may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money."
"1719","tt0046187","4192","13","But at what cost is the centerpiece of the film, as it involves stoolie Moe Ritter is one of the finest, and most believable, character actors from the period, the woman's ex a volatile Kiley, and the police department."
"1720","tt0046187","4192","14","Aside from the thematic elements, which are told with a keen dramatic, journalistic style as was Fuller's previous position, along with boxer, the dialog is fresh and involving."
"1721","tt0046187","4192","15","There's a spontaneity in many of Fuller's camera moves."
"1722","tt0046187","4192","16","And what a third act."
"1723","tt0046187","4192","17","This is a lean, tight film noir that is worth checking out even if you're not familiar with Fuller it's comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works."
"1724","tt0046187","4193","1","Director Sam Fuller has something of a cult following, particularly in Europe."
"1725","tt0046187","4193","2","Yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable."
"1726","tt0046187","4193","3","He did however direct one really terrific movie in ""Pickup on South Street""."
"1727","tt0046187","4193","4","Made pretty early on in his career, the movies that followed were vastly inferior."
"1728","tt0046187","4193","5","From the first to the last frame, ""Pickup"" works on all levels."
"1729","tt0046187","4193","6","It's filmed with flawless fluidity, boasting fine performances all round."
"1730","tt0046187","4193","7","Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances, are at their peak."
"1731","tt0046187","4193","8","Widmark, who was no stranger at playing villains, while truly mean to the core, still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making Jean Peters character's falling for him all the more credible."
"1732","tt0046187","4193","9","Fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie."
"1733","tt0046187","4193","10","There is a scene in which Jean Peters get roughed up by Widmark."
"1734","tt0046187","4193","11","It's truly shocking in its reality."
"1735","tt0046187","4193","12","This is not a case of carefully choreographed photography."
"1736","tt0046187","4193","13","Less self conscious than many film noir's of the period this remains a great example of the genre."
"1737","tt0046187","4194","1","Samuel Fuller brings his customary playful and stylish direction to this seedy, pulpy story and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of 1950s cinema."
"1738","tt0046187","4194","2","Richard Widmark plays a petty thief tough guy a role he perfected over the course of many movies, who snatches a young lady's Jean Peters wallet on a New York subway and with it a piece of much wanted microfilm."
"1739","tt0046187","4194","3","This is 1953, so of course the microfilm is property of Commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back."
"1740","tt0046187","4194","4","When the girl shows up at Widmark's waterfront shack, sent by an abusive boyfriend to reclaim the film, Widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her ""comrades"" down for big money."
"1741","tt0046187","4194","5","The plot thickens, people start dying, and Widmark and Peters fall in love."
"1742","tt0046187","4194","6","Fuller handles the love story clumsily, but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction."
"1743","tt0046187","4194","7","It's as if he included a love story under duress, and so made it intentionally unbelievable, as love stories so frequently were and still are in Hollywood films."
"1744","tt0046187","4194","8","Peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough New Yawk cookie, part gangster moll and part damsel in distress."
"1745","tt0046187","4194","9","When violence occurs against her, we genuinely care about her well being, and it's typical of Fuller's renegade, ahead of his time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion."
"1746","tt0046187","4194","10","But the ultimate success of ""Pickup on South Street"" rests squarely on the world weary shoulders of Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, a feisty lady who makes money any way she can, whether that be selling neckties or acting as a police informant."
"1747","tt0046187","4194","11","Ritter gives the performance of her career; in a breathtaking monologue, she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad trajectory of her character's life, and the hopelessness she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle, crime and hardship."
"1748","tt0046187","4194","12","It's as if every character Ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to vent in those other movies."
"1749","tt0046187","4194","13","The scene is the highlight of Fuller's film, and a highlight of 50s cinema, period."
"1750","tt0046187","4194","14","Grade: A+"
"1751","tt0046187","4195","1","This film is a spicy little piece of film making from Sam Fuller which gives Richard Widmark the chance to show of some of his best, most edgy acting in the role of Skip McCoy, a small time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful Candy's Jean Peters pocket on a crowded bus."
"1752","tt0046187","4195","2","It turns out Candy was doing a favor for her ex.boyfriend, who's working for the ""commies""."
"1753","tt0046187","4195","3","Superficially, there's a mystery here regarding Candy's motives and Skip spends much of the film determining her motives ."
"1754","tt0046187","4195","4","Actually he seems to just initially assume that she's a ""commie"", going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture."
"1755","tt0046187","4195","5","But the real question is  what's going on with Skip."
"1756","tt0046187","4195","6","What are his motives, and why does Candy like him so much."
"1757","tt0046187","4195","7","Why do we the audience want to like him so much."
"1758","tt0046187","4195","8","Basically what the film makers have done here is create a very striking ""male fatale"" in Widmark's character and his performance."
"1759","tt0046187","4195","9","Just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like ""The Big Sleep"" or ""The Glass Key"" along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face, the film makers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers."
"1760","tt0046187","4195","10","Widmark is handsome, and there's also a charm in his boyish insouciance  but the first two times he meets our leading lady, he robs her and then punches her in the face."
"1761","tt0046187","4195","11","Eventually the question becomes  would Skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck his comments to the police, like ""you're waving a flag at ME."" make us suspect he would or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend Moe Thelma Ritter."
"1762","tt0046187","4195","12","I'm not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way."
"1763","tt0046187","4195","13","Thelma Ritter's character work deserves special mention  she has created a truly indelible character here."
"1764","tt0046187","4195","14","Fuller isn't afraid to give her plenty of ""business""  in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world, particularly her used ties."
"1765","tt0046187","4195","15","Another example of Fuller's ""business"" would be the scene with Victor Perry an actor I've seen elsewhere used to less effect using the chopsticks to intimidate Candy."
"1766","tt0046187","4195","16","The emphasis on Moe's relationship with Skip provides one of cinema's most revealing ""honor among thieves"" themes."
"1767","tt0046187","4195","17","In fact Skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police, with the notable exception of Capt."
"1768","tt0046187","4195","18","Tiger Murvyn Vye who has a grudge against him."
"1769","tt0046187","4195","19","I loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack."
"1770","tt0046187","4195","20","Those are the kind of details that make this film feel real  whether or not it really is ""realistic"" or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions."
"1771","tt0046187","4195","21","All told, I would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the ""film noir"" school of film making."
"1772","tt0046187","4195","22","A predictable plot is off set by a host of colorful characters uniformly well performed, cheap sets are disguised by the film's unrelenting pace, and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is."
"1773","tt0046187","4195","23","This is the best film I've seen so far by Sam Fuller and helps me to see better why he's regarded as a master director  here he accomplished some things that I think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like ""The Crimson Kimono"" and ""Shock Corridor"" as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense."
"1774","tt0046187","4195","24","This is one of my favorite performances from Widmark that I've seen so far  and Widmark was a talent that I'm tempted to say based on the few extraordinary films I've seen with him was comparable to that of Alan Ladd or Humphrey Bogart, although arguably he didn't make as many classic films."
"1775","tt0046187","4196","1","This crime thriller is sort of like a film noir, though changes the context from post war to Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity."
"1776","tt0046187","4196","2","In ""Pickup on South Street"", policemen are good guys, criminals are genuine guys, and the only enemies are ""The Commies"", who are ultimately differentiated from the good guys in that they are emotionally personable, driven by an actual care for their own worth, as shown in the constant tracked in close ups that speckle the movie."
"1777","tt0046187","4196","3","This movie revolves around characters."
"1778","tt0046187","4196","4","The personalities in this film are rather unique and detailed: Skip the pick pocket who is able to stare down any danger, and sometimes while going through their personal possessions; Moe the informer who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of nearly all the other characters and the audience; Candy, the ill named innocent girl who only thinks she's doing government work and doesn't fully comprehend the conspiracy she's involved with; and Joey, the ex boyfriend evil Commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everybody and, ironically, is the worst person at doing it."
"1779","tt0046187","4196","5","Throw in a bunch of very colorful supporting characters such as the guy with the chopsticks and the policemen and ""Pickup on South Street"" treats you to a splendor of personalities as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames."
"1780","tt0046187","4196","6","PolarisDiB"
"1781","tt0046187","4197","1","'Shock Corridor 1963' was my first film from Samuel Fuller, and there I was impressed with the director's astute blending of B movie and big budget aesthetics, even if the story itself was pure schlock."
"1782","tt0046187","4197","2","'Pickup on South Street 1953' was released a decade earlier in Fuller's career, obviously produced on a larger budget from a big name studio, Twentieth Century Fox."
"1783","tt0046187","4197","3","Nevertheless, the visuals are still notable in that there's a somewhat raw, naturalistic element to the photography, not unlike Dassin's 'The Night and the City 1950' and Kazan's 'Panic in the Streets 1950' the latter was also shot by cinematographer Joe McDonald."
"1784","tt0046187","4197","4","In some scenes, Fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors' faces that they're out of focus, bluntly registering the intimate thoughts, emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features, the eye."
"1785","tt0046187","4197","5","Though unexpectedly prone to melodrama, and with just a hint of anti Communist propaganda, 'Pickup on South Street' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of New York City."
"1786","tt0046187","4197","6","When just out of prison pickpocket Skip McCoy Richard Widmark snags the purse of a woman on the subway Jean Peters, he pockets more than he'd originally bargained for."
"1787","tt0046187","4197","7","The woman, Candy, and her cowardly ex boyfriend Joey Richard Kiley had been smuggling top secret information to the Communists, and McKoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro film."
"1788","tt0046187","4197","8","Will he turn in the MacGuffin to the proper authorities, or sell it to the highest bidder."
"1789","tt0046187","4197","9","If 'Pickup on South Street' has a flaw, it's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti Communist agenda, reeking of propaganda like nothing since WWII Dwight Taylor, who supplied the story, also notably wrote 'The Thin Man Goes Home 1944,' the only propagandistic movie of the series."
"1790","tt0046187","4197","10","For no apparent reason, every identifiable character  even the smugly self serving Skip McCoy  eventually becomes a self sacrificing patriot, the transformation predictable from the outset."
"1791","tt0046187","4197","11","In traditional film noir, the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance, the rational punishment for his sins, but apparently not when they've served their country; patriotism wipes the slate clean."
"1792","tt0046187","4197","12","Richard Widmark, an actor who I'm really beginning to like, plays the haughty pickpocket with composure, though always with that hint of ill ease that suggests he's biting off more than he can chew."
"1793","tt0046187","4197","13","The opening scene on the train is the film's finest, as McCoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim's hand bag, recalling Bresson's 'Pickpocket 1959.'"
"1794","tt0046187","4197","14","Thelma Ritter is terrific as a tired street woman who'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it though, of course, she draws the line at Commies."
"1795","tt0046187","4197","15","Jean Peters is well cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side, playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour; Fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow legged strut of a prostitute."
"1796","tt0046187","4197","16","Nevertheless, Peters must suffer a contrived love affair with Widmark that really brings down the film's attempts at realism."
"1797","tt0046187","4197","17","Fascinatingly, upon its release, 'Pickup on South Street' was promptly condemned as Communist propaganda by the FBI, and the Communist Party condemned it for being the exact opposite."
"1798","tt0046187","4197","18","Go figure."
"1799","tt0046187","4198","1","From the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work RICHARD WIDMARK stealing from a woman's purse JEAN PETERS, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is relentlessly fascinating to watch."
"1800","tt0046187","4198","2","Partly it's because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast, the B&W photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters, and because Samuel Fuller's direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like John ASPHALT JUNGLE Huston."
"1801","tt0046187","4198","3","In fact, it has the same urgency as the Huston film about a heist that goes wrong but the payoff is not quite as strong."
"1802","tt0046187","4198","4","JEAN PETERS is excellent as the hard edged girl whom Widmark describes as being ""knocked around a lot""."
"1803","tt0046187","4198","5","She gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a micro film in her purse for her boyfriend RICHARD KILEY, something the FBI already knows about."
"1804","tt0046187","4198","6","They're on her trail when the theft occurs."
"1805","tt0046187","4198","7","THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman called ""Moe"" who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life."
"1806","tt0046187","4198","8","She's particularly touching in her final scene with Kiley."
"1807","tt0046187","4198","9","This one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time."
"1808","tt0046187","4198","10","Good noir from Fox and notable for the performances of Widmark, Peters and Ritter."
"1809","tt0046187","4199","1","The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive."
"1810","tt0046187","4199","2","It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter."
"1811","tt0046187","4199","3","Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much."
"1812","tt0046187","4199","4","That's the case here for an 80 minute black and white, mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography wise."
"1813","tt0046187","4199","5","The story is the story here as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc. as a pickpocket Widmark inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. say that three times!."
"1814","tt0046187","4199","6","Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant."
"1815","tt0046187","4199","7","She and Widmark are the stars of this film."
"1816","tt0046187","4199","8","Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her."
"1817","tt0046187","4199","9","Only in world of film!!"
"1818","tt0046187","4199","10","Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it."
"1819","tt0046187","4199","11","This an average film noir which means good, but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25 $35."
"1820","tt0046187","4199","12","For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market."
"1821","tt0046187","4200","1","Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: A ""Red Scare"" movie devoid of hysteria, in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot."
"1822","tt0046187","4200","2","Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm; unbeknownst to either of them, it harbors secrets vital to the Cold War."
"1823","tt0046187","4200","3","Peters, as it happens, was under surveillance by FBI agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who's running her, cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley."
"1824","tt0046187","4200","4","In trying to retrieve the precious film, both sides enlist the help of Thelma Ritter, a streetwise old jane who's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears."
"1825","tt0046187","4200","5","Fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story, which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality."
"1826","tt0046187","4200","6","From the subways to the waterfront, his midsummer Manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that's almost pungent."
"1827","tt0046187","4200","7","The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender, and they're scored to ""Again,"" a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House, also starring Widmark."
"1828","tt0046187","4200","8","The pace slackens for Ritter's beautifully written and played death scene among the most poignant vignettes in all noir, and a kind of mirage oasis in a film parched of sentimentality."
"1829","tt0046187","4200","9","This is writer/director Fuller's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle; his later explorations of American pathology The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld U.S.A. never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street."
"1830","tt0046187","4201","1","Pickup on South Street 1953, directed by movie maverick Samuel Fuller, contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication."
"1831","tt0046187","4201","2","Subway rider Candy Susan Peters collides with pickpocket Skip McCoy Richard Widmark dipped in shades of Sinatra cool."
"1832","tt0046187","4201","3","She's unaware that she carries valuable microfilm; McCoy is unaware of grifting it."
"1833","tt0046187","4201","4","Both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents."
"1834","tt0046187","4201","5","Thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges."
"1835","tt0046187","4201","6","Candy is doubly watched Skip and the police and therefore doubly naive; Skip, the overconfident petty thief, is singularly unaware, trailed by federal agents; the feds, all knowing, are ultimately helpless."
"1836","tt0046187","4201","7","They can't stop the ""passing"" of government secrets or the spread of communism."
"1837","tt0046187","4202","1","Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's Cold War influenced low budget noir vehicles."
"1838","tt0046187","4202","2","With a running length of under 80 minutes, PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is tough, gritty, explosive and endlessly entertaining."
"1839","tt0046187","4202","3","Widmark stars as pickpocket Skip McCoy, who has already been picked up three times."
"1840","tt0046187","4202","4","Yet McCoy can't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster's moll Candy Jean Peters."
"1841","tt0046187","4202","5","Candy's wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the Communist movement, and it's her last job for ex boyfriend Richard Kiley to make the delivery."
"1842","tt0046187","4202","6","However, when Widmark lifts it, Peters must do whatever it takes to re claim the film she initially knows nothing about."
"1843","tt0046187","4202","7","It's a tasty set up, with Widmark's character, while not the psycho of KISS OF DEATH, a real live wire, unpredictable and tough, yet curiously charming."
"1844","tt0046187","4202","8","When Bogart or Mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get: a lone anti hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end Bogart, or an overly laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap Mitchum."
"1845","tt0046187","4202","9","With Widmark you just don't know what you are going to get, and with his incredibly modern acting style his films always hold up well he is amazing to watch."
"1846","tt0046187","4202","10","Here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film, or handing it over to the police and fighting the ""Commies"" on the right side of the law."
"1847","tt0046187","4202","11","And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet."
"1848","tt0046187","4202","12","Peters gets her best role as the moll with a heart of gold Candy."
"1849","tt0046187","4202","13","Widmark's unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with Peters; the gorgeous tramp quickly and rather unbelievably the romance angle is rather rushedfalls under Widmark's spell, yet Widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around."
"1850","tt0046187","4202","14","Peters hard edged beauty, yet lack of over lacquered Hollywood glamour Lana Turner would never have worked well in this role, is a major asset to the film."
"1851","tt0046187","4202","15","Candy is not innocent, yet she's very vulnerable, constantly being passed between and slapped around by men."
"1852","tt0046187","4202","16","Widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face, yet by the final act he's a lot more tender to her after she cops one hell of a going over from Kiley."
"1853","tt0046187","4202","17","The scene in the hospital with Peters and Widmark shouldn't work, but it does."
"1854","tt0046187","4202","18","Thelma Ritter is brilliant as stoolie Moe, well deserving of her Oscar nomination."
"1855","tt0046187","4202","19","Ritter's performance, like everything else in the film, is gritty, real and heartbreakingly honest."
"1856","tt0046187","4202","20","Her death scene is stunning."
"1857","tt0046187","4202","21","Fuller's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting."
"1858","tt0046187","4202","22","Fuller loved a good close up, and PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is full of uncomfortable, cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot."
"1859","tt0046187","4202","23","Fuller isn't afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard Old Hollywood really allowed, yet stunningly pulls away from Ritter's death scene to give the audience maximum impact."
"1860","tt0046187","4202","24","The urban locales and unusual, confronting camera angles give PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET, a bold, uncompromisingly modern look.10/10."
"1861","tt0046187","4203","1","This is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s."
"1862","tt0046187","4203","2","This minimalist and fast working director has something unusual for his earlier films a cast with some stars."
"1863","tt0046187","4203","3","Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of Communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of America and they'll stop at nothing to succeed."
"1864","tt0046187","4203","4","The film starts with Peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents."
"1865","tt0046187","4203","5","They know she is a link in a long espionage chain."
"1866","tt0046187","4203","6","Unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation a small time pickpocket Widmark is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that Peters is carrying."
"1867","tt0046187","4203","7","Widmark thinks it's just another purse he's ransacked only later does he realize the seriousness of what he's stolen."
"1868","tt0046187","4203","8","Now it's Widmark on his own with Commies and the FBI hot on his trail."
"1869","tt0046187","4203","9","Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish."
"1870","tt0046187","4203","10","Although she didn't get top billing, a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter."
"1871","tt0046187","4203","11","This supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon."
"1872","tt0046187","4203","12","Seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady."
"1873","tt0046187","4203","13","As far as the script and directing go, they are very good but with one small exception."
"1874","tt0046187","4203","14","At first, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted."
"1875","tt0046187","4203","15","It's one of the few times on film you'll see a woman punched square in the mouth!"
"1876","tt0046187","4203","16","Now THAT'S tough."
"1877","tt0046187","4203","17","Later, inexplicably, they become amazingly close too close to be believable."
"1878","tt0046187","4203","18","Still, with so much great drama and such an effective Noir like film, this can be overlooked."
"1879","tt0046187","4203","19","See this film."
"1880","tt0046187","4204","1","and anyone who watches this film will agree."
"1881","tt0046187","4204","2","This film was directed in the days when plot, character believability and theme actually mattered."
"1882","tt0046187","4204","3","Jean Peters, Widmark, and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight."
"1883","tt0046187","4204","4","Ritter is in top form as informer ""Moe"" she survives in the Bowery section of NY, acting as a stool pigeon for NYC police."
"1884","tt0046187","4204","5","The only other film in which I have seen Peters is ""Niagara"", and she certainly proves her acting ability here, complete with Brooklyn accent."
"1885","tt0046187","4204","6","Widmark is appropriately menacing, as the anti hero who must discern what the right thing is, despite his need for cash."
"1886","tt0046187","4204","7","The photography is brilliant."
"1887","tt0046187","4204","8","The neon, the subway station though it looks cleaner than the real thing!"
"1888","tt0046187","4204","9","the harbor shack where Widmark lives as a transient."
"1889","tt0046187","4204","10","Excellent use is made of the city, with ""Lightning Louie"" in Chinatown; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop."
"1890","tt0046187","4204","11","10/10."
"1891","tt0046187","4205","1","Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America's great directors."
"1892","tt0046187","4205","2","I'm not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywood's great craftsmen."
"1893","tt0046187","4205","3","But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywood's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music."
"1894","tt0046187","4205","4","During the time he worked for Hollywood studios, he knew how to take an assignment, shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts...on time and on budget."
"1895","tt0046187","4205","5","Pickup on South Street is a case in point."
"1896","tt0046187","4205","6","On the surface it's one more of Hollywood's early Fifties' anti Commie movies, complete with appeals to patriotism, a hard boiled hero and a slimy and copiously perspiring bad guy."
"1897","tt0046187","4205","7","Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut, exciting drama with any number of off kilter twists."
"1898","tt0046187","4205","8","The hero, Skip McCoy, is a three time loser, a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his stripes until the very end."
"1899","tt0046187","4205","9","The girl in the caper, Candy, has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined."
"1900","tt0046187","4205","10","One of the most appealing characters, Moe Williams, is a stoolie."
"1901","tt0046187","4205","11","And in an unusual approach to Hollywood's battle against Commies, the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isn't motivated by anything so ennobling."
"1902","tt0046187","4205","12","He just wants payback for a personal reason, and winds up becoming...at least for now...a good guy."
"1903","tt0046187","4205","13","Plus, all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio."
"1904","tt0046187","4205","14","He had to make do."
"1905","tt0046187","4205","15","Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star, but Jean Peters is a surprise."
"1906","tt0046187","4205","16","She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb, and no better than her boy friends...or her clients...want her to be."
"1907","tt0046187","4205","17","And Richard Kiley, who later would become a two time Tony award winning star on Broadway, is convincingly slippery and cowardly."
"1908","tt0046187","4205","18","It's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us, I mean introduced to us, ""The Impossible Dream"" from Man of La Mancha, More than anything else, this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash, pursued by the Feds and the Commies, moves straight ahead with great economy."
"1909","tt0046187","4205","19","The whole enterprise, with a classic noir look, only takes 80 minutes to tell."
"1910","tt0046187","4205","20","The dialogue, with Fuller as screenwriter, has that party corny, partly pungent hard boiled pulp fiction style."
"1911","tt0046187","4205","21","""That muffin you grifted...she's okay,"" one character says to Skip about Candy."
"1912","tt0046187","4205","22","Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next."
"1913","tt0046187","4205","23","Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams."
"1914","tt0046187","4205","24","All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest, part comedy relief and part sad inevitability."
"1915","tt0046187","4205","25","The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fuller's talents and strengths."
"1916","tt0046187","4205","26","In 2 minutes and 15 seconds, starting right after the credits, Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie, to establish for us what the story is about, and to show us what kind of characters Skip and Candy we're going to be involved with."
"1917","tt0046187","4205","27","And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot, packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us."
"1918","tt0046187","4205","28","Says Glenn Erickson, in my opinion one of the best of movie critics, ""In what should be an inconsequential story, Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up: stiff necked, aggressive self interest that when fully expressed recognizes what's wrong and what's right and isn't afraid to fight for it."
"1919","tt0046187","4205","29","As always in his work, the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort."""
"1920","tt0046187","4205","30","He's right, and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years."
"1921","tt0046187","4206","1","Skip McCoy is a three time loser pick pocket, unable to curb his instincts back on the street, he picks the purse of Candy on a subway train."
"1922","tt0046187","4206","2","What he doesn't realise is that Candy is carrying top secret microfilm, microfilm that is of high interest to many many organisations."
"1923","tt0046187","4206","3","Director Samuel Fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of New York City."
"1924","tt0046187","4206","4","Communist spies and shady government operatives all blend together to make Pickup On South Street a riveting viewing from first minute to the last."
"1925","tt0046187","4206","5","Based around a Dwight Taylor story called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller enthused this adaptation with heavy set political agenda, something that many at the time felt was over done, but to only focus on its anti communist leanings is doing it a big disservice."
"1926","tt0046187","4206","6","Digging a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as any that Fuller has directed, the main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece, a crook and a shallow human being, his heroics are not born out of love for his country, they are born out of his sheer stubborn streak."
"1927","tt0046187","4206","7","It's quite an achievement that Fuller has crafted one of the best anti heroes of the 50s, and i'm sure he was most grateful to the performance of Richard Widmark as McCoy, all grin and icy cold heart, his interplay with the wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent, and is the films heart."
"1928","tt0046187","4206","8","However it is the Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter who takes the acting honours, her Moe is strong and as seedy as the surrounding characters, but there is a tired warmth to her that Ritter conveys majestically."
"1929","tt0046187","4206","9","It's a B movie in texture but an A film in execution, Pickup On South Street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director."
"1930","tt0046187","4206","10","9/10"
"1931","tt0046187","4207","1","Skip McCoy Richard Widmark pick pockets Candy's Jean Peters wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the Communist cause."
"1932","tt0046187","4207","2","She is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact."
"1933","tt0046187","4207","3","However, Skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone's noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and Joey Richard Kiley and Candy who want the microfiche back."
"1934","tt0046187","4207","4","Skip can only be traced through Moe Thelma Ritter who sells information on criminals."
"1935","tt0046187","4207","5","It is made clear to Skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film, but he intends to hold out for a high price."
"1936","tt0046187","4207","6","This leads to Joey hunting after him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who has fallen in love with Skip."
"1937","tt0046187","4207","7","Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss."
"1938","tt0046187","4207","8","Its a well acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away."
"1939","tt0046187","4207","9","Its a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from Joey."
"1940","tt0046187","4207","10","Its a good film."
"1941","tt0046187","4208","1","Every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one."
"1942","tt0046187","4208","2","This also happened in the '50's with quite a few little movies, that not a lot of people have ever heard of."
"1943","tt0046187","4208","3","There are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the '50's that are worth digging out."
"1944","tt0046187","4208","4","""Panic in the Streets"" is another movie like that that springs to the mind."
"1945","tt0046187","4208","5","Both are movies that aren't really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources."
"1946","tt0046187","4208","6","I was really surprised at how much I ended up liking this movie."
"1947","tt0046187","4208","7","It was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed."
"1948","tt0046187","4208","8","Like all 'old' movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and it's characters you're in for a real treat with this movie."
"1949","tt0046187","4208","9","The movie has a really great story that involves espionage, though the movie doesn't start of like that."
"1950","tt0046187","4208","10","It begins as this typical crime thriller with a touch of film noir to it."
"1951","tt0046187","4208","11","But ""Pickup on South Street"" just isn't really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on."
"1952","tt0046187","4208","12","It ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watch."
"1953","tt0046187","4208","13","I also really liked the characters within this movie."
"1954","tt0046187","4208","14","None of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses."
"1955","tt0046187","4208","15","Really humane."
"1956","tt0046187","4208","16","It also especially features a great performance from Thelma Ritter, who even received a well deserved Oscar nomination for."
"1957","tt0046187","4208","17","It has really got to be one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen."
"1958","tt0046187","4208","18","Even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great, original, special little movie that deserves to be seen by more!"
"1959","tt0046187","4208","19","10/10"
"1960","tt0046187","4209","1","""Pickup On South Street"" is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists."
"1961","tt0046187","4209","2","The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing."
"1962","tt0046187","4209","3","The use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality."
"1963","tt0046187","4209","4","Samuel Fuller's style of directing and the cinematography by Joseph MacDonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere."
"1964","tt0046187","4209","5","Ace pickpocket and repeat offender Skip McCoy Richard Widmark gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named Candy Jean Peters on the New York subway."
"1965","tt0046187","4209","6","She was being used by her ex boyfriend Joey Richard Kiley to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her, she was carrying US Government secrets recorded on microfilm."
"1966","tt0046187","4209","7","Two FBI agents had been following Candy and witnessed the theft."
"1967","tt0046187","4209","8","One of the agents continues to tail her back to Joey's apartment and the other, Zara Willis Bouchey, visits Police Captain Dan Tiger Murvyn Vye."
"1968","tt0046187","4209","9","Zara explains that the FBI has been following Candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist group."
"1969","tt0046187","4209","10","In order to identify the pickpocket, Tiger calls in a ""stoolie"" called Moe Thelma Ritter who after being given a precise description of the ""cannon's"" method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects."
"1970","tt0046187","4209","11","Once Tiger sees Skip's name on the list he's immediately convinced that he's the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him."
"1971","tt0046187","4209","12","When Skip is brought into Tiger's office, Zara tells him about the microfilm and Tiger offers to drop any charges if he'll co operate with the investigation."
"1972","tt0046187","4209","13","Skip is flippant and arrogant."
"1973","tt0046187","4209","14","He clearly doesn't trust Tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway."
"1974","tt0046187","4209","15","Joey orders Candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it."
"1975","tt0046187","4209","16","Candy pays Moe for Skip's address and when Skip returns from being questioned by Tiger, he finds Candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money."
"1976","tt0046187","4209","17","When she recovers, Skip demands payment of $25,000 for the microfilm."
"1977","tt0046187","4209","18","She tells Joey about Skip's demand and Joey's boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following evening."
"1978","tt0046187","4209","19","Skip and Candy are attracted to each other and it's because of their uneasy, developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police."
"1979","tt0046187","4209","20","It soon becomes apparent, however, that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct action."
"1980","tt0046187","4209","21","The depictions of Skip, Candy and Moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compelling."
"1981","tt0046187","4209","22","Moe's work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time."
"1982","tt0046187","4209","23","She appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as ""an old clock running down"" and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in Long Island."

"2067","tt0046187","4215","29","Character drives the plot, as it should, and the close ups are used to augment character."
"2068","tt0046187","4215","30","When Skip interrogates Candy, the close up captures the sexual energy between them, belying the hostility of Skip's words."

"2098","tt0046187","4216","2","An example of the directing: When Candy Jean Peters starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in as if it's an alarm going off in her head."
"2099","tt0046187","4216","3","It's not cartoon like it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just ""clicks"" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag."
"2100","tt0046187","4216","4","Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart alec he's really great but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for ""Moe,"" the street peddler/informer, played by Thelma Ritter."

"2105","tt0046187","4216","9","Wonderful stuff."""
"2106","tt0046187","4216","10","Pickup On South Street"" is also one of the few movies where, even though the characters aren't perfect, you do care about them perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape: Skip as a ""three time loser"" and Candy as a youngish woman who has ""knocked around"" a lot."
"2107","tt0046187","4216","11","When these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect, it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human."

"2125","tt0061809","2719","13","The bird lifted Perry to paradise."
"2126","tt0061809","2719","14","Strangely, Perry says that he has an aversion to Nuns, God and Religion."
"2127","tt0061809","2719","15","This echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whom."
"2128","tt0061809","2719","16","The director puts in all sorts of what ifs and only ifs."

"2136","tt0061809","2719","24","But Dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing."
"2137","tt0061809","2719","25","Dick wants the hard cash, the $10,000 he thinks is in the Clutter's safe, which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as Perry's Mexican Treasure."

"2148","tt0061809","2720","1","IN COLD BLOOD has to be ranked as first rate movie making, even if the subject matter is about as grim as it gets in the world of make believe, but film noir fans should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work, based as it is on a true life crime spree."
"2149","tt0061809","2720","2","It opens with Quincy Jones' music under the credits and starkly dramatic views of a highway bus heading toward Kansas City, effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end."

"2188","tt0061809","2722","5","The only complaint is that it is a bit overlong, with the denouement dragged out and somewhat preachy."
"2189","tt0061809","2723","1","IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks."
"2190","tt0061809","2723","2","However, it's also so bent on being realistic, it's sometimes more clinical than entertaining."
"2191","tt0061809","2723","3","Recounting the brutal killing of a Midwest family, author Truman Capote focused on minutia, wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject AND subjects!"

"2200","tt0061809","2724","3","Its exceptionally well made yet forces the viewer to think."
"2201","tt0061809","2724","4","Some have complained not only about the film, but about Truman Capote's source ""non fiction novel"", that the central message is unsubtle."
"2202","tt0061809","2724","5","That may be true, but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity doesn't detract from the film at all."
"2203","tt0061809","2724","6","Its refreshing, especially considering today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to see a film with a convinced political voice unafraid to force the audience to consider its viewpoint."

"2213","tt0061809","2725","1","""In Cold Blood"", adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals."
"2214","tt0061809","2725","2","The film excels as a character study of the killers, particularly trigger man Perry Smith Robert Blake."
"2215","tt0061809","2725","3","The cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease."
"2216","tt0061809","2725","4","Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities."

"2218","tt0061809","2725","6","The rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on."
"2219","tt0061809","2725","7","Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction."
"2220","tt0061809","2725","8","In my opinion, both were excellent, though the script does miscalculate with some ill advised narration in the late stages."
"2221","tt0061809","2725","9","The Oscar nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top notch, as is the editing."
"2222","tt0061809","2725","10","Also worthy of note is the jazzy score by Quincy Jones which secured the last of the film's four Oscar nominations."
"2223","tt0061809","2725","11","Unlike so many other crime films, this one doesn't glamorize violence."
"2224","tt0061809","2725","12","Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them."
"2225","tt0061809","2725","13","Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach."
"2226","tt0061809","2725","14","I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled."
"2227","tt0061809","2726","1","This movie is up there with the all time classics."

"2231","tt0061809","2726","5","My guess is that its a hard movie to find."

"2235","tt0061809","2727","2","Haunting Quincy Jones musical score and terrific acting by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, the killers."
"2236","tt0061809","2727","3","Why Wilson didn't go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me."
"2237","tt0061809","2727","4","The black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch."
"2238","tt0061809","2727","5","The re creation of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination, even more scary than if they had shown the shotgun going off."
"2239","tt0061809","2727","6","The movie was filmed in the actual Clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders."
"2240","tt0061809","2727","7","The movie has a very documentary feel besides the scenes at the actual Clutter home other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores the killers actually went to."
"2241","tt0061809","2727","8","Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie."
"2242","tt0061809","2727","9","Will Geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real Clutter murder jurors portraying themselves as the jury for the movie."
"2243","tt0061809","2727","10","This is a solid movie, scary every time you see it."
"2244","tt0061809","2728","1","Simply one of the best ever!"
"2245","tt0061809","2728","2","Richard Brooks' adaptation of Truman Capote's non fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement."

"2247","tt0061809","2728","4","This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and wasn't even nominated for Best Picture while Dr."
"2248","tt0061809","2728","5","Doolittle was."
"2249","tt0061809","2728","6","Go Figure!"
"2250","tt0061809","2728","7","Although you don't get to know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain staking process of tracking these guys down."
"2251","tt0061809","2728","8","John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey."
"2252","tt0061809","2728","9","There are simply no flaws in this one. 10 out of 10."
"2253","tt0061809","2728","10","Best performance = Scott Wilson with R."
"2254","tt0061809","2728","11","Blake a close second."
"2255","tt0061809","2728","12","Highly recommended!"
"2256","tt0061809","2729","1","I voted excellent for how well the acting was, not for the content."
"2257","tt0061809","2729","2","It still gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie."
"2258","tt0061809","2729","3","Two ex cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison."
"2259","tt0061809","2729","4","During the ride, the tension begins to mount, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation."
"2260","tt0061809","2729","5","After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend."
"2261","tt0061809","2729","6","The blood curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really made my blood run cold and gave me chills."
"2262","tt0061809","2729","7","That the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family."
"2263","tt0061809","2729","8","Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith."
"2264","tt0061809","2729","9","The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote."
"2265","tt0061809","2730","1","I saw this in the theater during it's initial release and it was disturbing then as I'm sure it would still be."
"2266","tt0061809","2730","2","It was the first part of '68 and this was still making the rounds in towns across America and there had recently been a mass murder in my hometown where I saw this where a man went on a shooting rampage."
"2267","tt0061809","2730","3","The freshness of that close to home event combined with this dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience."
"2268","tt0061809","2730","4","It really brought to life the excellent acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson."
"2269","tt0061809","2730","5","I was familiar with the novel based on the true event by Truman Capote and the screenplay and direction by Richard Brooks wove the event and Truman's interpretation into compelling gritty cinematic adaptation."
"2270","tt0061809","2730","6","Music from Quincy Jones effectively scores it's story."
"2271","tt0061809","2730","7","I've only seen this a couple times since."
"2272","tt0061809","2730","8","It was too real."
"2273","tt0061809","2730","9","Almost like being a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers."
"2274","tt0061809","2730","10","I would give this a 9.0 of a possible 10."
"2275","tt0061809","2730","11","Society is so desensitized to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and could be viewed with less effect but to anyone over 50 this will be a hallmark into the examination of the criminal psyche."

"2277","tt0061809","2731","2","I am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years."
"2278","tt0061809","2731","3","She said that Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath no conscience extraordinarily well."
"2279","tt0061809","2731","4","I agree!"
"2280","tt0061809","2731","5","She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself superbly."
"2281","tt0061809","2731","6","I agree!"
"2282","tt0061809","2731","7","What a chilling and tremendous film."
"2283","tt0061809","2731","8","I have seen over 2000 films and would rank this in the top 100."
"2284","tt0061809","2731","9","My lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly."
"2285","tt0061809","2731","10","My only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film."
"2286","tt0061809","2731","11","Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these 2 losers did."
"2287","tt0061809","2732","1","Herbet Clutter, wife Bonnie, and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of Holcomb, Kansas but in the early hours of 14 November 1959 all four were brutally murdered."
"2288","tt0061809","2732","2","Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion."
"2289","tt0061809","2732","3","The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD."
"2290","tt0061809","2732","4","Controversial, shocking, and exceptionally well written, it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day."
"2291","tt0061809","2732","5","The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself."
"2292","tt0061809","2732","6","Filmed in black and white in many of the real life locations, it has a slightly documentary quality, icy and detached and the overall cast is exceptional."
"2293","tt0061809","2732","7","This is the film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly so."
"2294","tt0061809","2732","8","As killer Perry Smith, Blake traps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy; it is a masterful performance from start to finish."
"2295","tt0061809","2732","9","As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less fine."
"2296","tt0061809","2732","10","Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and brings them to the Clutter home only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction."
"2297","tt0061809","2732","11","The centerpiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the Clutter home; actually filmed in the Clutter house itself, it is a spinechilling sequence, horrific and deeply disturbing."
"2298","tt0061809","2732","12","Director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy."
"2299","tt0061809","2732","13","Given the overall power of the film, however, this becomes a trivial annoyance."
"2300","tt0061809","2732","14","Strong stuff and recommended."

"2320","tt0061809","2733","19","His contention being: ""These two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours"" This is a line of logic which would induce me to render a verdict of a conviction if I were to be one of the members of the jury!!"

"2322","tt0061809","2733","21","It was Capote's instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the American public's attention!!"
"2323","tt0061809","2733","22","As it turn out, it was a harbinger of things to come.."
"2324","tt0061809","2733","23","""In Cold Blood"" did just that!!"

"2339","tt0061809","2733","38","In the case of ""In Cold Blood"" it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant, intellectually elevating, and, of course, it goes without saying, ""In Cold Blood"" was utterly spellbinding, as well as a totally remarkable movie!!"
"2340","tt0061809","2734","1","Easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century."
"2341","tt0061809","2734","2","In Cold Blood is brilliant in the simplicity and realism of its storytelling, and absolutely riveting."
"2342","tt0061809","2734","3","Robert Blake walks away with the film."
"2343","tt0061809","2734","4","The story seems to be presented almost entirely from Perry's viewpoint, despite Dick being the leader and planner of the pair."
"2344","tt0061809","2734","5","The viewer will invariable perceive Dick as being more unstable, immature, and generally feel like Perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but for Dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score."
"2345","tt0061809","2734","6","Based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy, In Cold Blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural Kansas family one cold, windy night, because Dick has bought into an age old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in their home."
"2346","tt0061809","2734","7","As ""prosecutor"" a character that isn't given a name in the script, played by Will Geer, so astutely points out, their lives are bought for only $10 a head."
"2347","tt0061809","2734","8","Director Richard Brooks wisely chooses not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until the end of the film, prior to this we only know it has happened and watch the lives of Dick and Perry slowly unravel as they attempt to escape not only being apprehended by law enforcement, but also Perry's own ever escalating sense of impending doom."
"2348","tt0061809","2734","9","He repeatedly makes remarks, ""No one ever gets away with a thing like that,"" and ""I can't help thinking we left something behind that belongs to us."""
"2349","tt0061809","2734","10","Dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime, only irritation at Perry's."
"2350","tt0061809","2734","11","Indeed, after they are caught, it is Dick who breaks first, and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime."
"2351","tt0061809","2734","12","I felt somewhat sorry for Perry from the very beginning of the film, and more so as events progressed, but I only loathed Dick."
"2352","tt0061809","2734","13","The genius of the film is the engaging manner in which the story is played."
"2353","tt0061809","2734","14","We do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters, but that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred."
"2354","tt0061809","2734","15","The story is unrelenting, taunt, the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few minutes."
"2355","tt0061809","2734","16","For those of you who are interested in such things, I noticed a couple of the ""Goofs"" listed here on the IMDb page for In Cold Blood are incorrect or exaggerated."
"2356","tt0061809","2734","17","Such as the ""reversed"" process shot, at the beginning of the film, as Dick and Perry are driving across the bridge into Kansas."
"2357","tt0061809","2734","18","To begin with, this isn't even a process shot, the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield of the car is real."
"2358","tt0061809","2734","19","A large cargo truck located to the left front of Dick's Pontiac creates the optical illusion that they are going backward because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed, but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle."
"2359","tt0061809","2734","20","As I previously stated, this is one of the ten best works of 20th century cinema, not recommended for the very young due to some course language and implied and inferred violence no actual in your face gore as a modern film would resort to, but a thoroughly excellent film."
"2360","tt0061809","2735","1","The actual crime story at the core of In Cold Blood might seem a little 'tame' for those who are weened on the classic serial killer stories Gein, Bundy, Dahmer, or just the more notorious cases out in Hollywood OJ, Manson."
"2361","tt0061809","2735","2","The essential facts in the case don't amount to anything terribly convoluted: Perry Smith and Dick Hickock here played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson respectively met by some luck, conspired to rob a man's farmhouse safe out in Kansas, and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and dagger came away with 43 dollars."
"2362","tt0061809","2735","3","Aside from their returning to the US after fleeing briefly to Mexico, there isn't a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either."
"2363","tt0061809","2735","4","They were caught by some stroke of ironic chance a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after Smith and Hickcock helped out a boy and his old man collecting bottles for change, and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead."
"2364","tt0061809","2735","5","The story ended in 1965."
"2365","tt0061809","2735","6","But it's the handling of the story, moments of moot, the performances, a pure cinematic touch that Brooks and his absolutely marvelous the late/great DP Conrad Hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white, and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama save perhaps for near the end, which is pitch perfect."
"2366","tt0061809","2735","7","The air of tragedy hangs over the story, and not so much because of the killings themselves, no matter how brutal they are as the ""third"" man that is conjured up, as the narrator observes, by Smith and Hickcock teaming up, but because of the inevitability of the story."
"2367","tt0061809","2735","8","You feel somehow for these criminals, who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a B movie."
"2368","tt0061809","2735","9","These aren't good people, but they aren't necessarily monsters either, at least all the way through."
"2369","tt0061809","2735","10","It's also an excellent 'road movie' as we see Smith and Hickcock on the road down to the Clutter residence the actual night time scene of the crime taking place late in the film, then on to Mexico, then back to America towards Las Vegas."
"2370","tt0061809","2735","11","We get to soak in the personalities of these two, probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an inmate."
"2371","tt0061809","2735","12","It's actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two sort of akin to the aimless quality of Malick's Badlands characters, and it's also a sign of daring for the period."
"2372","tt0061809","2735","13","There's no sermonizing, like ""he did this because of that and this or the other."""
"2373","tt0061809","2735","14","We see how Smith had an abusive, psychotic father, but that Smith loved and hated him."
"2374","tt0061809","2735","15","The complexity there is too much for the movie, maybe even too much for Capote's book which, I should confess, I've still yet to read, though I plan to."
"2375","tt0061809","2735","16","And we see Hickcock is this creature of slick confidence i.e. getting the suit and other things with bad checks, but without any deep rooted explanation to it all."
"2376","tt0061809","2735","17","The streak of fatalism in In Cold Blood is some of the starkest of the 60s, and it's the luck of Brooks to have its stars as Blake in his top of the pops performance this and Lost Highway, oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years, his quintessential pieces of work, and Wilson's breakthrough before becoming a character actor."
"2377","tt0061809","2735","18","While they're surrounded by fine supporting work, they themselves are eerily absorbing, driven more or less by greed and fantasies of escapism with treasure, and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends."
"2378","tt0061809","2735","19","Is this a morale of the story, if there could be one, that it's more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill can't be classified, of good vs evil getting smudged."
"2379","tt0061809","2735","20","Smith apologized for his crime before being hung, and he points out, ""but to who."""
"2380","tt0061809","2735","21","This is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of true crime the bonafide chills, and it's quite possibly the best American film of 1967."
"2381","tt0061809","2736","1","A unique film...one of the best of all time."
"2382","tt0061809","2736","2","Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing, etc. just fantastic."
"2383","tt0061809","2736","3","As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas farm family the Clutters by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery."
"2384","tt0061809","2736","4","I've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film."
"2385","tt0061809","2736","5","The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them."
"2386","tt0061809","2736","6","Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing."
"2387","tt0061809","2736","7","Cocky, twitchy, and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming, oily and plausible."
"2388","tt0061809","2736","8","Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well lonely, and at once empathetic and cold blooded."
"2389","tt0061809","2736","9","Who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it."
"2390","tt0061809","2736","10","He does, and it's brilliant!"
"2391","tt0061809","2736","11","A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully."
"2392","tt0061809","2736","12","Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high water marks, and that stands for acting period."
"2393","tt0061809","2736","13","The cops are wonderful too."
"2394","tt0061809","2736","14","Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well."
"2395","tt0061809","2736","15","Unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles, these are just genuine flatfeet, working the case with determination and competence."
"2396","tt0061809","2736","16","They seem so real."
"2397","tt0061809","2736","17","I've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen most of the crime classics going way back."
"2398","tt0061809","2736","18","Really one of a kind in this respect."
"2399","tt0061809","2736","19","PARTIAL SPOILER COMING this movie's unique in that you already know what's happened, but I'm warning for the record."
"2400","tt0061809","2736","20","Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks, Mano a Mano."
"2401","tt0061809","2736","21","This movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film."
"2402","tt0061809","2736","22","Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel, unaware the cops have the goods on them."
"2403","tt0061809","2736","23","But the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions."
"2404","tt0061809","2736","24","This is some of the best acting you'll ever see."
"2405","tt0061809","2736","25","Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating."
"2406","tt0061809","2736","26","To help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story, ICB was filmed at the actual Clutter house, and I've heard the Clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel."
"2407","tt0061809","2736","27","It works."
"2408","tt0061809","2736","28","These seem like decent, simple folk."
"2409","tt0061809","2736","29","It makes the crime so palpable and sad."
"2410","tt0061809","2736","30","I'll stop here."
"2411","tt0061809","2736","31","It's not a feel good movie, but it is one of the best movies ever made, and so unique, it's mandatory viewing for every film buff."
"2412","tt0061809","2737","1","The movie was gripping from start to finish and its b/w photography of the American heartland is stunning."
"2413","tt0061809","2737","2","We feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into Mexico and back to America again."
"2414","tt0061809","2737","3","Near the end of the movie, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face."
"2415","tt0061809","2737","4","In the end, we follow them up the stairway to their final moment."
"2416","tt0061809","2737","5","The two criminals, performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could be seen on any street in any town."
"2417","tt0061809","2737","6","Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town."
"2418","tt0061809","2737","7","This point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else."
"2419","tt0061809","2737","8","Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition."
"2420","tt0061809","2737","9","These two delusional men kill an entire family, looking for a safe that isn't there."
"2421","tt0061809","2737","10","Once on the run, they start writing bad cheques, carving out a trail for the authorities."
"2422","tt0061809","2737","11","There are many fine supporting actors."
"2423","tt0061809","2737","12","I like John Forsyth as the detective on the case, Alvin Dewey."
"2424","tt0061809","2737","13","Also, Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney."
"2425","tt0061809","2737","14","I have often wanted to see this movie all the way through, having only caught it in short snatches; I did finally get to it after buying the DVD."
"2426","tt0061809","2737","15","The result is the finest classic crime movie I have ever seen."
"2427","tt0061809","2737","16","Don't miss this brilliant movie."
"2428","tt0061809","2737","17","To me, this is what great film making is all about."
"2429","tt0061809","2738","1","I haven't seen this in over 20yrs but I still remember things about it."
"2430","tt0061809","2738","2","This film could NOT have been made in color."
"2431","tt0061809","2738","3","The stark grays are what make it, and was life really that simple in the 1950's.."
"2432","tt0061809","2738","4","What stands out the most in my memory is Perry Smith going to the gallows."
"2433","tt0061809","2738","5","His breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap."
"2434","tt0061809","2738","6","I don't think I could watch that again.....once is plenty."
"2435","tt0061809","2738","7","It's like that unnamed guy at the beginning of ""Papillon"" who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine."
"2436","tt0061809","2738","8","The guy that said watch this on a double bill with ""Dead Man Walking"" should have added the last 10 minutes of ""I Want To Live"" as well."
"2437","tt0061809","2738","9","Some of my ancestors being ""aristos"" went to the guillotine in 1794 95 so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense."
"2438","tt0061809","2739","1","Criminals Perry Smith and Richard ""Dick"" Hickock believe Mr."
"2439","tt0061809","2739","2","Clutter of Holcomb, Kansas keeps a large supply of cash on hand in a safe."
"2440","tt0061809","2739","3","On November 15, 1959 at two a.m. they end up murdering Mr. and Mrs."
"2441","tt0061809","2739","4","Clutter and their teenage son and daughter."
"2442","tt0061809","2739","5","After a little police investigation the two men are found and sentenced to be hanged."
"2443","tt0061809","2739","6","In Cold Blood 1967 is directed by Richard Brooks."
"2444","tt0061809","2739","7","Now, I haven't read the Truman Capote novel this movie is based on, so I can't make any comparisons."
"2445","tt0061809","2739","8","The movie does a brilliant job telling of those horrific events that actually took place."
"2446","tt0061809","2739","9","Robert Blake is excellent as Perry."
"2447","tt0061809","2739","10","Of course, Blake had the murder case of his own a few years back, being accused of murdering his wife."
"2448","tt0061809","2739","11","He's free now, but we still don't know the truth."
"2449","tt0061809","2739","12","What ever that may be, he's still a very fine actor."
"2450","tt0061809","2739","13","Scott Wilson does remarkable job as Hickock."
"2451","tt0061809","2739","14","John Forsythe is terrific as Alvin Dewey."
"2452","tt0061809","2739","15","Paul Stewart is very good as Jensen."
"2453","tt0061809","2739","16","Jeff Corey is marvelous as Mr."
"2454","tt0061809","2739","17","Hickock."
"2455","tt0061809","2739","18","Same thing with Charles McGraw who plays Tex Smith."
"2456","tt0061809","2739","19","John McLiam portrays Herbert Clutter, Ruth Storey is his wife Bonnie, Brenda Currin is the daughter Nancy and Paul Hough is the son Kenyon."
"2457","tt0061809","2739","20","Great job by each of them."
"2458","tt0061809","2739","21","There is much to remember from this film."
"2459","tt0061809","2739","22","Let's start from the lighter side."
"2460","tt0061809","2739","23","It's pretty great when Perry wants to go hunting for gold in Mexico and says to Hickock: Remember Bogart in Treasure of the Sierra Madre."""
"2461","tt0061809","2739","24","And Blake himself was in that movie as a boy!"
"2462","tt0061809","2739","25","And it's a fun moment when they, giving a ride to that boy and his granddad, collect bottles and turn them in for refund money."
"2463","tt0061809","2739","26","Those darker moments are the most haunting ones."
"2464","tt0061809","2739","27","The flashback sequence, where you see the murders happening, is extremely terrifying."
"2465","tt0061809","2739","28","When Perry goes to kill the girl, Nancy last, and she says ""Oh, please, don't""..."
"2466","tt0061809","2739","29","The brutality of man, it's impossible to explain."
"2467","tt0061809","2739","30","Then the hanging scene."
"2468","tt0061809","2739","31","First there goes Hickock and then Perry, first talking to the minister."
"2469","tt0061809","2739","32","In the last image of the movie we see Perry hitting the end of the rope."
"2470","tt0061809","2739","33","Sure movies,and books may try to sympathize these villains."
"2471","tt0061809","2739","34","Especially Perry's character is someone you could feel sorry for."
"2472","tt0061809","2739","35","He thinks of his mom, and dad who he hates, but still loves."
"2473","tt0061809","2739","36","But it doesn't change the fact both of these men these actors portray are brutal murderers, who don't feel sorry for anybody."
"2474","tt0061809","2739","37","They go to this house and murder an entire family, in cold blood."
"2475","tt0061809","2739","38","How could you sympathize these people."
"2476","tt0061809","2740","1","Tremendous black and white nighttime cinematography, and plenty of it, highlights this supposedly true life account of a 1950s murder in Kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two men."
"2477","tt0061809","2740","2","The story was written by Truman Capote, so you get the very Liberal anti death penalty message at the end of the film, which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case."
"2478","tt0061809","2740","3","Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family."
"2479","tt0061809","2740","4","Despite the annoying slant at the end, this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating."
"2480","tt0061809","2740","5","Famed photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this."
"2481","tt0061809","2740","6","It makes me wish more modern day films were made in black and white."
"2482","tt0061809","2740","7","See it on DVD.Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here."
"2483","tt0061809","2740","8","My third viewing of this film came in early April of 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife."
"2484","tt0061809","2740","9","One can't help but look at Blake and this film differently after that."
"2485","tt0061809","2741","1","As I have matured, my fascination with the Academy Awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement."
"2486","tt0061809","2741","2","As in a few other comments that I have written, the bizarre results of Academy Award voting are often difficult to explain."
"2487","tt0061809","2741","3","The omission of ""In Cold Blood"" in 1967 as one of the five Best Picture nominees is one of those inexplicable instances, especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable ""Dr."
"2488","tt0061809","2741","4","Dolittle."""
"2489","tt0061809","2741","5","While only an insomniac or masochist would tune in to that Rex Harrison disaster, Richard Brook's powerful adaptation of Truman Capotes non fiction novel retains its ability to capture the viewer's attention and leave him or her completely drained by the final fade out."
"2490","tt0061809","2741","6","While there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen, the film is definitely adult material."
"2491","tt0061809","2741","7","Based on a Nebraska multiple murder in the 1950's and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place, ""In Cold Blood"" was filmed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall in stark black and white, and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio."
"2492","tt0061809","2741","8","Together with Quincy Jones's unsettling score, Hall's work should have been credited above the title with Brook's screenplay as the three pillars on which this intense classic is built."
"2493","tt0061809","2741","9","The performances are fine as well."
"2494","tt0061809","2741","10","Scott Wilson is all cold charm and Robert Blake intense introversion as the two killers."
"2495","tt0061809","2741","11","There is an inside joke at one point when Blake speaks of Bogart and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" while the duo are driving to Mexico."
"2496","tt0061809","2741","12","As a child star, Blake sold the lottery ticket to Bogart in that John Huston film."
"2497","tt0061809","2741","13","The film, like the book, is definitely slanted towards the killers and has an anti capital punishment tilt, although the remorselessness of the murderers somewhat negates that sentiment despite the difficult to watch final scenes."
"2498","tt0061809","2741","14","Some have criticized the film because it does focus on the criminals, their backgrounds, and lives, while the Clutter family, which was literally murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night, come across as one dimensional characters of little import."
"2499","tt0061809","2741","15","This lack of balance comes from the book as Capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row."
"2500","tt0061809","2741","16","The Clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth."
"2501","tt0061809","2741","17","However, whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment, ""In Cold Blood"" will leave you mired deep in conflicting thoughts."
"2502","tt0061809","2741","18","Run a double bill with ""Dead Man Walking,"" and you may not speak for days."
"2503","tt0061809","2742","1","Richard Brooks excellent 1967 film of Truman Capote's novel IN COLD BLOOD is a perfect companion piece to Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar winning performance in the 2005 CAPOTE."
"2504","tt0061809","2742","2","They really play well together try them on separate nights."
"2505","tt0061809","2742","3","It is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well."
"2506","tt0061809","2742","4","These two truly enhance each other."
"2507","tt0061809","2742","5","Even though different actors play the roles of killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces blend well."
"2508","tt0061809","2742","6","Only the part of the writer played by Paul Stewart in the Brooks films is weaker, as they give him a different name then Capote."
"2509","tt0061809","2742","7","I'd suggest watching CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD."
"2510","tt0061809","2742","8","It makes for a powerful experience!"
"2511","tt0061809","2743","1","In the year 2006, ""In Cold Blood"" a riveting thriller from 1967 has two new interesting contexts that it did not previous have."
"2512","tt0061809","2743","2","First, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, Robert Blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife."
"2513","tt0061809","2743","3","Second, the recent Oscar winning biopic, ""Capote"" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author, Truman Capote."
"2514","tt0061809","2743","4","These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience."
"2515","tt0061809","2743","5","As a stand alone film from it's era, ""In Cold Blood"" is top notch in every way."
"2516","tt0061809","2743","6","Most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall later of ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"" fame."
"2517","tt0061809","2743","7","Many of the stills from this film of the Kansas farm house at night or the tree lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography."
"2518","tt0061809","2743","8","Combined with the cracker jack direction from Brooks and superb editing in the early scenes where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers, a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events."
"2519","tt0061809","2743","9","It's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screen."
"2520","tt0061809","2743","10","The film is also anchored nicely by Robert Blake's eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo."
"2521","tt0061809","2743","11","The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done."
"2522","tt0061809","2743","12","Then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last ""confession"" so to speak."
"2523","tt0061809","2743","13","It's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting, superb writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography."
"2524","tt0061809","2743","14","I dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down Robert Blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears."
"2525","tt0061809","2743","15","The only thing hampering ""In Cold Blood"" is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end."
"2526","tt0061809","2743","16","The tacked on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey."
"2527","tt0061809","2744","1","Remarkable, disturbing film about the true life, senseless, brutal murder of a small town family, along with the aftermath, and examination of the lives of the killers, Dick Hickok and Perry Smith."
"2528","tt0061809","2744","2","No matter how much time goes by, or how dated this film may look, it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this."
"2529","tt0061809","2744","3","This really traces multiple tragedies: The tragedy, brutality and senselessness of the murder of the Clutter family, a decent farm family in small town Holcomb, Kansas; and the wasted, brutal and sad lives of Hickok and Smith."
"2530","tt0061809","2744","4","An interesting point is made in the film: that neither of these two immature, scared, petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone."
"2531","tt0061809","2744","5","But, together, they created a dangerous, murderous collective personality; one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them."
"2532","tt0061809","2744","6","They push each other along a road of ""proving"" something to each other."
"2533","tt0061809","2744","7","That they were man enough to do it, to carry it out; neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big ""score""; an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led."
"2534","tt0061809","2744","8","These were two grown up children, who live in a criminal's world of not backing down from dares; who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness. in this instance, these needs carried right through to the murder of the Clutters."
"2535","tt0061809","2744","9","The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the Clutter family, but the point is made."
"2536","tt0061809","2744","10","These were respected, law abiding, small town people, who didn't deserve this terrifying fate."
"2537","tt0061809","2744","11","The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith."
"2538","tt0061809","2744","12","Perry Smith, whose early life was filled with security and love, but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path."
"2539","tt0061809","2744","13","Hickok, poor and left pretty much to his own devices, not able to see how he fit in, using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with."
"2540","tt0061809","2744","14","An interesting, and maybe the first, look at capital punishment, and what ends we hope to achieve."
"2541","tt0061809","2744","15","Is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us, or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these."
"2542","tt0061809","2744","16","Is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit, operating under the radar, believing they fool everyone they come into contact with."
"2543","tt0061809","2744","17","To be deterred, you must believe it's possible you will be caught."
"2544","tt0061809","2744","18","Is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught.; who have committed hundreds of petty crimes, and got away with them."
"2545","tt0061809","2744","19","This was supposed to be a ""cinch"", ""no witnesses""."
"2546","tt0061809","2744","20","When caught, Hickok finds he can't charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks."
"2547","tt0061809","2744","21","Smith, who believes he deserves such a fate anyway, who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done, willingly tells the story when he learns that Hickok has cowardly caved in."
"2548","tt0061809","2744","22","Hickok blinked first."
"2549","tt0061809","2744","23","A silly game of chicken between two immature, emotionally damaged, dangerous men."
"2550","tt0061809","2744","24","Fascinating psychological thriller, telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation's history."
"2551","tt0061809","2744","25","Stunning portrayals by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson."
"2552","tt0061809","2744","26","These roles made their careers."
"2553","tt0061809","2745","1","I've seen a great many films, but 'In Cold Blood' stands alone in a class by itself."
"2554","tt0061809","2745","2","It excels in every department."
"2555","tt0061809","2745","3","The fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story, rather than the name on the marquee."
"2556","tt0061809","2745","4","Blake and Wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo."
"2557","tt0061809","2745","5","The fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place, even inside the very house, add additional chills."
"2558","tt0061809","2745","6","The black/white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent."
"2559","tt0061809","2745","7","There are many outstanding cinematic works out there, but if I could only vote for one to top the list, it would most probably be ""In Cold Blood""."
"2560","tt0061809","2746","1","Imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night, and then going to bed."
"2561","tt0061809","2746","2","There's no need to lock the doors."
"2562","tt0061809","2746","3","The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees."
"2563","tt0061809","2746","4","Sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway."
"2564","tt0061809","2746","5","Moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room."
"2565","tt0061809","2746","6","What makes this image so scary is the setting: a remote farmhouse ... at night."
"2566","tt0061809","2746","7","Based on Truman Capote's best selling book, and with B&W lighting comparable to the best 1940's noir films, ""In Cold Blood"" presents a terrifying story, especially in that first Act, as the plot takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads."
"2567","tt0061809","2746","8","It's the stuff of nightmares."
"2568","tt0061809","2746","9","But this is no dream."
"2569","tt0061809","2746","10","The events really happened, in 1959."
"2570","tt0061809","2746","11","Two con men with heads full of delusions kill an entire Kansas family, looking for a stash of cash that doesn't exist."
"2571","tt0061809","2746","12","Director Richard Brooks used the actual locations where the real life events occurred, even the farmhouse ... and its interior!"
"2572","tt0061809","2746","13","It makes for a memorable, and haunting, film."
"2573","tt0061809","2746","14","Both of the lead actors closely resemble the two real life killers."
"2574","tt0061809","2746","15","Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith, short and stocky with a bum leg, who dreams of finding Cortez' buried treasure."
"2575","tt0061809","2746","16","Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the smooth talking con artist with an all American smile."
"2576","tt0061809","2746","17","After their killing spree, the duo head to Mexico."
"2577","tt0061809","2746","18","Things go awry there, so they come back to the U.S., stealing cars, hitchhiking, and generally being miserable as they roam from place to place."
"2578","tt0061809","2746","19","But it's a fool's life, and the two outlaws soon regret their actions."
"2579","tt0061809","2746","20","The film's final twenty minutes are mesmerizing, as the rain falls, the rope tightens, and all we hear is the pounding of a beating heart."
"2580","tt0061809","2746","21","Even with its somewhat mundane middle Act, ""In Cold Blood"" stages in riveting detail a real life story that still hypnotizes, nearly half a century later."
"2581","tt0061809","2746","22","It's that setting that does it."
"2582","tt0061809","2746","23","Do you suppose people in rural Kansas still leave their doors unlocked ... at night."
"2583","tt0061809","2747","1","Although it was released way back in 1967, IN COLD BLOOD still remains the benchmark by which all true crime films are matched."
"2584","tt0061809","2747","2","Veteran writer/director Richard Brooks ELMER GANTRY adapted Truman Capote's non fiction book into a chilling docudrama that retains a disturbing power even today, thirty five years later."
"2585","tt0061809","2747","3","Robert Blake and Scott Wilson portray Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, two ex cons who, on a tip from Hicock's old cellmate Floyd Wells, broke into the Holcomb, Kansas home of Herbert Clutter, looking for a wall safe supposedly containing $10,000."
"2586","tt0061809","2747","4","But no safe was ever found, and the two men instead wound up killing Mr."
"2587","tt0061809","2747","5","Clutter, his wife, and their two children, getting away with only a radio, a pair of binoculars, and a lousy forty dollars."
"2588","tt0061809","2747","6","Two months on the run, including an aimless ""vacation"" in northern Mexico, ended in Las Vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car."
"2589","tt0061809","2747","7","But it eventually comes out, after merciless grilling by Kansas law enforcement officials, that these two men committed that heinous crime in Holcomb."
"2590","tt0061809","2747","8","Tried and convicted on four counts of murder, they stew in jail over a five year period of appeals and denials until both are hanged to death on April 14, 1965."
"2591","tt0061809","2747","9","Blake and Smith are absolutely chilling as the two dispassionate killers who show no remorse for what they've done but are concerned about getting caught."
"2592","tt0061809","2747","10","John Forsythe also does a good turn as Alvin Dewey, the chief detective investigating the crime, as does Gerald S."
"2593","tt0061809","2747","11","O'Laughlin as his assistant."
"2594","tt0061809","2747","12","In a tactic that is both faithful to Capote's book and a good artistic gambit all around, Brooks does not show the murders at the beginning; instead, he shows the two killers pulling up to the Clutter house as the last light goes out, then cuts to the next morning and the horrifying discovery of the bodies."
"2595","tt0061809","2747","13","Only during the ride back to Kansas, when Blake is questioned by Forsythe and narrates the story, do we see the true horror of what happened that night."
"2596","tt0061809","2747","14","We don't see that much blood being spilled in these scenes, but we don't need to."
"2597","tt0061809","2747","15","The shotgun blasts and the horrified look on the Clutters' faces as they know they are about to die are more than disturbing enough, so there is no need to resort to explicitly bloody slasher film violence."
"2598","tt0061809","2747","16","Brooks wisely filmed IN COLD BLOOD in stark black and white, and the results are excellent thanks to Conrad Hall's expertise."
"2599","tt0061809","2747","17","The chilling jazz score by Quincy Jones is the capper."
"2600","tt0061809","2747","18","The end result is one of the most unsettling films of any kind ever made, devastating in its own low key fashion."
"2601","tt0061809","2747","19","It is a 134 minute study of a crime that shook an entire state and indeed an entire nation, and should be seen, though viewer discretion is advised; the 'R' rating is there for a reason."
"2602","tt0089374","4582","1","I do find it a bit overrated."
"2603","tt0089374","4582","2","Maybe it's just because I've never seen a subtitled version dubbing stinks!, but I just don't get into it like a lot of other people do."
"2604","tt0089374","4582","3","The finale is really great though as Jackie trashes a mall, a scene that plays in my head every time i go shopping!"
"2605","tt0089374","4583","1","I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles."
"2606","tt0089374","4583","2","I thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over acting."
"2607","tt0089374","4583","3","This took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score, which really irked me throughout the entire movie."
"2608","tt0089374","4583","4","If the musical score was improved I could overlook the few overacted scenes."
"2609","tt0089374","4583","5","Then the film would be much, much better."
"2610","tt0089374","4584","1","I have not seen each and every one of Chan´s movies, but this is for sure the best one I have seen so far."
"2611","tt0089374","4584","2","The story in it self is nothing special really, so I won´t go deeper into that."
"2612","tt0089374","4584","3","What makes it special is the stunts, the fighting, the good acting, the warm sense of humor."
"2613","tt0089374","4584","4","The movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it."
"2614","tt0089374","4584","5","All the cool stunts of course made by Jackie himselfmakes you want jump around in the couch and scream."
"2615","tt0089374","4584","6","It´s just awesome!"
"2616","tt0089374","4584","7","Even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it."
"2617","tt0089374","4584","8","I know this Police Story can be a bit hard to get a hold of, at least it is here in Sweden."
"2618","tt0089374","4584","9","But I can assure you, it´s worth a try."
"2619","tt0089374","4585","1","This movie is Jackie's best."
"2620","tt0089374","4585","2","I still cant get enough of watching some of his best stunts ever."
"2621","tt0089374","4585","3","I also like the bad guys in this movie the old man looks like a Chinese version of John Howard."
"2622","tt0089374","4585","4","Unlike some of Jackie's other work, this movie has also got a great story line and i recommend it to all of Jackie's fans."
"2623","tt0089374","4586","1","Jackie Chan's classic directorial feature POLICE STORY 1985 is among the most influential and over the top modern day police actioners ever to come out from Hong Kong."
"2624","tt0089374","4586","2","Jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other ""urban"" action which would later become very popular and typical among HK directors like John Woo and Ringo Lam."
"2625","tt0089374","4586","3","POLICE STORY mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds."
"2626","tt0089374","4586","4","Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a police who gets to protect an important witness Brigitte Lin who would soon testify against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity."
"2627","tt0089374","4586","5","Jackie's girlfriend is played by young and sweet Maggie Cheung, who isn't as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like Heroic Trio and the sequel by Johnnie To, Savior of the Soul by Corey Yuen and David Lai and many many others."
"2628","tt0089374","4586","6","The plot in POLICE STORY is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place."
"2629","tt0089374","4586","7","Jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes, some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which Jackie hits his head near the eye through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass."
"2630","tt0089374","4586","8","Also Jackie's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film."
"2631","tt0089374","4586","9","The scene in which a bus stops right before Jackie, spitting the kidnappers through the windshield, went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen didn't fly as they were supposed to."
"2632","tt0089374","4586","10","They were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries."
"2633","tt0089374","4586","11","During the end credits, there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless, but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely."
"2634","tt0089374","4586","12","The action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by action director Chan."
"2635","tt0089374","4586","13","The now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the wildest scenes any action film has been able to deliver."
"2636","tt0089374","4586","14","Jackie always tells how important editing is which is true and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra kinetic when compared to Hollywood efforts, for instance."
"2637","tt0089374","4586","15","There's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch."
"2638","tt0089374","4586","16","But there is again one negative point which I cannot stand in HK action comedies, which is this comedy itself."
"2639","tt0089374","4586","17","The comedy isn't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay aren't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there, without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue."
"2640","tt0089374","4586","18","I mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare, and he is there to ""murder"" that girl."
"2641","tt0089374","4586","19","This kind of acting is stupid and inept and I wouldn't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre."
"2642","tt0089374","4586","20","Characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those ""loud thoughts"" are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and ""light."""
"2643","tt0089374","4586","21","Even if the film is comic and not so serious, these kind of stupidities should not be there and they cannot be forgiven too easily."
"2644","tt0089374","4586","22","POLICE STORY is a fast speed, full impact, balls to the walls action adventure miracle from Hong Kong and from the time when Jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the US produced The Protector as he didn't have the same thoughts about the film as director James Glickenhaus had and thus the result didn't please audiences and Jackie and he returned to Hong Kong to make more personal and inventive film."
"2645","tt0089374","4586","23","That he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80's."
"2646","tt0089374","4586","24","This is among the most insane action films ever, and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws I mentioned."
"2647","tt0089374","4586","25","7/10"
"2648","tt0089374","4587","1","Although John Woo's hard Boiled is my number 1 favorite movie."
"2649","tt0089374","4587","2","But i have to say police story is my number 2 favorite movie."
"2650","tt0089374","4587","3","I say this because the stunts, the fights and the action my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps off the rail at the top of the esculator at the mall grabs on to a pole surrounded with Chrismas lights and slid down the pole fell through a skylight and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor."

"2657","tt0089374","4588","2","Quebec Rating:13+should be G Canadian Home Video Rating:14AI have seen Police Story a couple of times now."
"2658","tt0089374","4588","3","In my opinion Police Story is Chan's best film from the 80's."
"2659","tt0089374","4588","4","He originally made it because he didn't like the other cop film he had to star in which was The Protector."
"2660","tt0089374","4588","5","I have not seen the protector so I cant compare."
"2661","tt0089374","4588","6","The acting isn't too bad and the plot is pretty good."
"2662","tt0089374","4588","7","I don't remember the plot well because I saw this film a while back but what I do remember is this film has lots of great action,stunts and comedy just what a good Chan film needs."
"2663","tt0089374","4588","8","If you can find Police Story and you are Chan fan then buy this film!"
"2664","tt0089374","4588","9","Runtime:106min 9/10"
"2665","tt0089374","4589","1","Well, I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan's best film."
"2666","tt0089374","4589","2","The plot, the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent."
"2667","tt0089374","4589","3","In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui Kevin Chan in some versions who successfully arrested a crime lord."
"2668","tt0089374","4589","4","After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer."
"2669","tt0089374","4589","5","Due to this, he became wanted by the police."
"2670","tt0089374","4589","6","Later on, Salina Brigitte Lin, who was the secretary of the crime lord, went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to Chan."
"2671","tt0089374","4589","7","However, the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her."
"2672","tt0089374","4589","8","Later on, Chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen, defeating them one by one."
"2673","tt0089374","4589","9","At the last scene, Chan was seen punching the crime lord."
"2674","tt0089374","4589","10","Lastly, this is the best action and comedy movie."
"2675","tt0089374","4589","11","Everyone should watch it."
"2676","tt0089374","4589","12","Highly recommended."
"2677","tt0089374","4590","1","Maybe the movie itself isn't one of the best Jackie Chan's movies, but I think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made."
"2678","tt0089374","4590","2","There also was some memorable stunts, which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic."
"2679","tt0089374","4590","3","This movie influenced many other action movies and I think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film like they could remake that chase scene, I thing with modern technologies they could make it even better."
"2680","tt0089374","4590","4","There also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie wasn't fighting."
"2681","tt0089374","4590","5","Althou I think they could put more fighting scenes in this film."
"2682","tt0089374","4591","1","It's depressing to see where Jackie Chan has ended up."
"2683","tt0089374","4591","2","He used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible stunts."
"2684","tt0089374","4591","3","To be fair, he's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown."
"2685","tt0089374","4591","4","But with 'Rush Hour 3', where he takes a back seat to Chris Tucker of all people!, and then there's 'Kung Fu Panda' where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue... to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement."
"2686","tt0089374","4591","5","It's times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old VHS tape and watch Jackie kick some arses in his younger, fitter, Chris Tucker free days."
"2687","tt0089374","4591","6","Enter 'Police Story'."
"2688","tt0089374","4591","7","Jackie Chan plays Kar kui, a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial."
"2689","tt0089374","4591","8","He faces resistance from both the unco operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both."
"2690","tt0089374","4591","9","But on the other hand, who cares."
"2691","tt0089374","4591","10","We don't watch Jackie Chan films for the story."
"2692","tt0089374","4591","11","We watch them to see Jackie Chan perform eye popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is."
"2693","tt0089374","4591","12","And on that level, 'Police Story' doesn't disappoint at all."
"2694","tt0089374","4591","13","There is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in Jackie sliding down a giant, high voltage chandelier."
"2695","tt0089374","4591","14","Seriously, if this sort of thing happened more often, no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes."
"2696","tt0089374","4591","15","There is also comedy, much of which involves Kar kui inadvertently upsetting May Maggie Cheung, his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend."
"2697","tt0089374","4591","16","The humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle, but it works so I'm not complaining."
"2698","tt0089374","4591","17","The acting isn't too subtle, either."
"2699","tt0089374","4591","18","Indeed, I'm not sure there was anything subtle about 'Police Story' at all."
"2700","tt0089374","4591","19","Director Jackie Chan yeah, he does that too clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films, and knows that while we're waiting for the next fight to start, the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning."
"2701","tt0089374","4591","20","So 'Police Story' is a blast."
"2702","tt0089374","4591","21","As is the case with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition."
"2703","tt0089374","4591","22","I mean, when Jackie Chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella, a whole new ""Wow!"""
"2704","tt0089374","4591","23","factor is added to the action."
"2705","tt0089374","4592","1","Jackie Chan's Police Story is a landmark film for both the Honk Kong action genre and the career of Jackie Chan."
"2706","tt0089374","4592","2","Directed/written by Chan, Police Story has a basic plot as did all the films of that era and genre, and like most of the the films of Police Storys' kind, the script is nothing to be raved about."
"2707","tt0089374","4592","3","But the plot of the film is Jackie Chan, who plays a nice guy cop, struggling to convict the local gang lord."
"2708","tt0089374","4592","4","The direction of the film is nothing special and by no means the best directing effort that Jackie Chan has given us, that responsibility falls to the underrated masterpiece ""Miracles""."
"2709","tt0089374","4592","5","However the job that Jackie does directing is sufficient and respectable."
"2710","tt0089374","4592","6","The standout out directing of the film comes with the fight scenes."
"2711","tt0089374","4592","7","The performances in this film also vary with Jackie giving a very solid typical Chan nice guy up against it role, but this is by no means his best acting role, that can been seen in the Sammo Hung directed film ""Heart of the Dragon""."
"2712","tt0089374","4592","8","The other actors in the film also give as good a solid performance as Jackie with Bridgete Lin playing her part of the unwilling witness reasonably well, but neither does she display full acting potential."
"2713","tt0089374","4592","9","The standout acting comes from Maggie Cheung as Jackies' suffering girlfriend and Bill Tung as the sympathetic and funny police chief."
"2714","tt0089374","4592","10","None of the performances in this film is of a low enough standard to affect the quality of the film."
"2715","tt0089374","4592","11","The action in the film is what really separates this film from others with stunning contemporary choreography to suit the urbanised, modern setting, the action is some some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on camera."
"2716","tt0089374","4592","12","To begin with there is a shootout in the slum where Koo ganglord is making a drug deal, whilst being no John Woo style sequence, this serves as a nice starter for the film."
"2717","tt0089374","4592","13","This is then followed by the famous car run down the side of the hill and through the heart of the slum wrecking everything in sight."
"2718","tt0089374","4592","14","This is a breathtaking sequence that has since been shamelessly copied by Bad Boys 2."
"2719","tt0089374","4592","15","In the middle of the film is yet another standout sequence as Jackie tries to transport Bridgete Lin from her house to his."
"2720","tt0089374","4592","16","This is really the first scene where we get to see the awesome fast paced hand to hand combat that has since become the norm for all modern set martial art films."
"2721","tt0089374","4592","17","This sequence is fantastically choreographed, timed and seamlessly edited together to maximise the brutality of the scene."
"2722","tt0089374","4592","18","However, as tradition dictates, the standout fight sequence is at the end of the film."
"2723","tt0089374","4592","19","This sequence displays some of Chans' best choreography, stunts and camera/editing work."
"2724","tt0089374","4592","20","This sequence is now famous for two things, the amount of people sent through high density glass, which has to be said a phenomenal amount of people, and the stunt at the end where Jackie leaps from a 5th storey balcony, grabs hold of a pole and slides down through a glass roof this has to be seen to be believed."
"2725","tt0089374","4592","21","Whilst the two for mentioned factors are both uniquely brilliant, i think that the most impressive part of this fight sequence is Chans' ability to incorporate anything into the fight sequence and the sheer originality of the choreography, that for me has never been bettered."
"2726","tt0089374","4592","22","I also believe that the action in Police Story is some of the best filmed and edited action of Chans career helping to set the action apart from others."
"2727","tt0089374","4592","23","Overall, Police Story, despite its unspectacular storyline and script and over running in the middle due to plot padding, is one of the best action films of all time displaying Chans best choreography, best filmed action and arguably his most spectacular stunt making this essential viewing for everyone."
"2728","tt0089374","4592","24","Afterall, we watch a Chan movie for the action!!"
"2729","tt0089374","4593","1","Police Story is one of Jackie Chan's classic films that helped shape the Hong Kong cinema."
"2730","tt0089374","4593","2","It is a masterpiece that should not be missed by any action movie fan."
"2731","tt0089374","4593","3","From the beginning it is obvious that Jackie Chan's stunt team literally risked their live to make this film."
"2732","tt0089374","4593","4","Both the action and the stunts are extremely realistic and innovative."
"2733","tt0089374","4593","5","Even today, no movie has outdone police story in dangerous stunts."
"2734","tt0089374","4593","6","Many people were hospitalized in Police Story including Jackie Chan."
"2735","tt0089374","4593","7","The fighting is not as indisputably exceptional as the stunts but the fighting in this movie helped change and define Jackie Chan's use of props."
"2736","tt0089374","4593","8","Throughout the film Chan uses odd object to stop attackers and is constantly throwing assailants through thick glass."
"2737","tt0089374","4593","9","The action feels real because the stuntmen are giving the movie all they have to give and Jackie Chan's coordination is outstanding."
"2738","tt0089374","4593","10","The rest of the aspects of the film are not without flaws but they will not disappoint any action fan."
"2739","tt0089374","4593","11","Chan not only plays a believable risk taking cop but shows the powerful changes that his character goes through as he falls into escalating desperation."
"2740","tt0089374","4593","12","The plot is powerful but a modern viewer may find it tedious at times."
"2741","tt0089374","4593","13","While the comedy will provide a good number of laughs it does not always distract the audience from the lack of action."
"2742","tt0089374","4593","14","However, for the time period it was made in, the driving aspects of the plot are entertaining."
"2743","tt0089374","4593","15","There a good number of interesting and well played characters dispersed throughout the film as well."
"2744","tt0089374","4593","16","Overall police story is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever made."
"2745","tt0089374","4593","17","And even in Hollywood the influences of this one film are not to be ignored."
"2746","tt0089374","4594","1","The best martial arts movie ever made."
"2747","tt0089374","4594","2","This one movie is better than anything Bruce Lee ever did."
"2748","tt0089374","4594","3","A classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax."
"2749","tt0089374","4594","4","Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu."
"2750","tt0089374","4594","5","It's a great pity that whilst Bruce Lee had been so overrated, it took Jackie Chan an eternity to become popular in Europe and America."
"2751","tt0089374","4594","6","Jackie rules!!!!"
"2752","tt0089374","4595","1","Jackie Chan name is synonomus to stunts."
"2753","tt0089374","4595","2","This movie never let you down."
"2754","tt0089374","4595","3","The opening best chase scene and last roll down scene from the pole is so risky than one wonder ,if he knows the meaning of fear."
"2755","tt0089374","4595","4","This movie comes very close to Jackie's best which is PROJECT A.But the main difference being that PROJECT A contains three stars where as in this movie Jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders."
"2756","tt0089374","4595","5","This is perhaps the main reason that this movie made jackie an biggest martial arts star followed by Bruce Lee."
"2757","tt0089374","4595","6","The film has nice comic touches too."
"2758","tt0089374","4595","7","What makes this film work is Jakie's ability to show his venerable side which his in contract to the typical martial arts action hero."
"2759","tt0089374","4595","8","This movie was followed by a sequel which was good but was quite tame in comparison to its predecessor."
"2760","tt0089374","4596","1","This is Jackie Chan's best film, and my personal favourite."
"2761","tt0089374","4596","2","After the disappointing U.S made 'The Protector' directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into Hong Kong."
"2762","tt0089374","4596","3","This is also probably Jackies most violent movie, with the audience cringing at the bone breaking stunts."
"2763","tt0089374","4596","4","The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design."
"2764","tt0089374","4596","5","Bones were broken and blood spilt in the process of making this film as you'll see in the credits."
"2765","tt0089374","4596","6","The script is a simple cops and robbers affair, nothing special, after all it was written around the action."
"2766","tt0089374","4596","7","I must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing, but it shouldn't put you off too much."
"2767","tt0089374","4596","8","So, get the lads round, crack open the beers and enjoy."
"2768","tt0089374","4596","9","By the way, the film was nicknamed 'Glass Story' by the stunt crew."
"2769","tt0089374","4596","10","Why."
"2770","tt0089374","4596","11","I'll let you find out for yourself!!"
"2771","tt0089374","4597","1","Having first achieved fame with Drunken Master, Jackie Chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983's Project A, a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re established him as a major star."
"2772","tt0089374","4597","2","By the time Police Story was released two years later, the extraordinary hype surrounding Jackie was reaching its zenith, and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts, brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy."
"2773","tt0089374","4597","3","It broke numerous box office records and inspired a 50% rise in police recruits, but, viewed 20 years on is it any good."
"2774","tt0089374","4597","4","As an action movie Police Story unquestionably stands up."
"2775","tt0089374","4597","5","There are several terrific fight scenes, some stuntwork that recalls the very best of Chan's hero Buster Keaton, and a compelling if over violent climactic tussle."
"2776","tt0089374","4597","6","Jackie's performance is also very strong, and whilst the frequent forays into laboured comedy dull the film's impact just a little, his charisma carries it through."
"2777","tt0089374","4597","7","Furthermore, in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger, Jackie took a momentous gamble ... though in the event nobody seems to have noticed!"
"2778","tt0089374","4597","8","By praising Police Story as a simple 'Good vs."
"2779","tt0089374","4597","9","Evil' battle critics belittled the film's ambiguity of tone, and whilst it's hardly The Brothers Karamazov, in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas."
"2780","tt0089374","4597","10","In short, this remains a quality ""popcorn"" movie though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the film's final scene a potent, boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period."
"2781","tt0089374","4598","1","This is one of Jackies best films that is him without opera buddies Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao it has one of the best openings in any action film and it carrys on in that way with Jackie showing some high quality stunts the only critisim is that in the middle it gets a bit slow but it shows up for a frantic last 25 mins in the film and the end credits show what a crazy fool jackie chan is just to keep us film addicts happy"
"2782","tt0089374","4599","1","This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie and in an interview, Jackie said it was his favorite as well."
"2783","tt0089374","4599","2","It contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well."
"2784","tt0089374","4599","3","This movie was a favorite of Brandon Lee, who used parts in Rapid Fire, and was also lifted in Tango and Cash, which used some of the opening scenes."
"2785","tt0089374","4599","4","Jackie plays a policeman in Hong Kong."
"2786","tt0089374","4599","5","The story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a shanty town and continues as Jackie slides down a hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil Ku who is one of the greatest villains in any Jackie Chan movie."
"2787","tt0089374","4599","6","You can expect some very funny scenes as Jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girl friend, played by Maggie Chung."
"2788","tt0089374","4599","7","His job is to protect Ku's secretary who has enough information to take him down, but even that poses many problems."
"2789","tt0089374","4599","8","Jackie is at his absolute best here."
"2790","tt0089374","4599","9","The last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone period."
"2791","tt0089374","4599","10","It was the most intense fight I have ever seen Jackie do and climaxes in a slide down a pole amidst exploding lights."
"2792","tt0089374","4599","11","All in all, one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin pealed off his hands."
"2793","tt0089374","4599","12","He was fortunate he was not electrocuted as the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of a lower voltage."
"2794","tt0089374","4599","13","All in all, another Chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies."
"2795","tt0089374","4599","14","By the end of this movie, you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen."
"2796","tt0089374","4599","15","So many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie that nobody would insure them anymore Jackie had to take responsibility himself."
"2797","tt0089374","4599","16","There are no gimmicks, wires or stand ins it is all true life action that is a treat to watch."
"2798","tt0089374","4599","17","It is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will amaze people 100 years from now."
"2799","tt0089374","4599","18","If you have not seen this movie and are a fan of Jackie Chan or action in general, give yourself a treat and watch this movie."
"2800","tt0089374","4599","19","It is truly sensational."
"2801","tt0089374","4600","1","This is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here."
"2802","tt0089374","4600","2","This is still the best Action movie ever done."
"2803","tt0089374","4600","3","The action movies of today are badly done The actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly. only some no how to do it mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan."
"2804","tt0089374","4600","4","The stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever."
"2805","tt0089374","4600","5","The start where Chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing."
"2806","tt0089374","4600","6","The end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film."
"2807","tt0089374","4600","7","The end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass Jackie was badly hurt."
"2808","tt0089374","4601","1","Police Story is a stunning series of set pieces for Jackie Chan to show his unique talents and bravery."
"2809","tt0089374","4601","2","Some of the stunts here are among Jackie's best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably Jackie's greatest single fight sequence, more brutal and less comedic then say Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impact."
"2810","tt0089374","4601","3","But unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements."
"2811","tt0089374","4601","4","I always prefer JC in films such as Project A where his natural comic talents shine through."
"2812","tt0089374","4601","5","In the serious confines of some elements of Police Story it just doesn't work for me."
"2813","tt0089374","4601","6","Having said that though this is still up there with Jackies best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectacle."
"2814","tt0089374","4601","7","As usual with Hong Kong films avoid the English dubbed DVD version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitles."
"2815","tt0089374","4601","8","Great stunts, OK movie a fine starting point if you've not seen a JC movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 7/10"
"2816","tt0089374","4602","1","Police story brought Hong Kong movies to modern day cinema."
"2817","tt0089374","4602","2","Jackie plays a policeman who tries to catch some drug dealers and at the same time take care of a young woman from the bad guys, and still take care of his relationship with his girlfriend Selina Brigitte Lin."
"2818","tt0089374","4602","3","The movie features plenty of stunts, not only from Jackie, but also from other actors who are now in Jackies stunt club."
"2819","tt0089374","4602","4","Three of Jackie's stunt members went to hospital during filming on the film."
"2820","tt0089374","4602","5","The movie also have some incredible fights scenes like ''the car park fight'' and ''the shoppingmal fight ranks as one of Jackie's finest."
"2821","tt0089374","4602","6","The movie also won award for best movie and best action design by Jackie Chan at Hong Kong film awards."
"2822","tt0089374","4602","7","Everyone who loves Jackie Chan and/or martial art movies shud see this"
"2823","tt0089374","4603","1","There is one detail, which is not very common for Jackie Chan movies, but which is present here."
"2824","tt0089374","4603","2","It has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too."
"2825","tt0089374","4603","3","Jackie is menacing and psychotic here."
"2826","tt0089374","4603","4","He is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back in a usual laid back pattern, but he is the one who can go and start the tumult."
"2827","tt0089374","4603","5","His manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing."
"2828","tt0089374","4603","6","Every time it goes ""crack!""."
"2829","tt0089374","4603","7","I also especially enjoy the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend."
"2830","tt0089374","4603","8","It's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen."
"2831","tt0089374","4603","9","Besides, the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall it also looks like a poster of ""rabochiy"" from our Soviet era and some lines in Russian on the left I noticed that quite accidentally."
"2832","tt0089374","4603","10","That looks terrific and nostalgic for Russian people."
"2833","tt0089374","4603","11","I also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies."
"2834","tt0089374","4603","12","Here there's a lot of this stuff."
"2835","tt0089374","4603","13","It's quite amazing watching the characters falling/jumping/running/driving through all manner of panes."
"2836","tt0089374","4603","14","All three movies are great."
"2837","tt0089374","4603","15","I had been preparing myself to see the down slide of the quality but I saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts and not only Jackie Chan's character appears in all three movies that's also excellent and keeps continuity up."
"2838","tt0089374","4603","16","I would like to describe each movie just in a few words: No.1 great in all aspects it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end and funny many scenes are ridiculous; No.2 raging Jackie is really beep off here and painful Jackie gets tortured; No.3 unbelievable the woman that fights alongside with Jackie is incredible and bombastic should I mention a lot of guns and explosions.."
"2839","tt0089374","4603","17","As to the rest much has been mentioned by the others."
"2840","tt0089374","4603","18","It's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again at least by me."
"2841","tt0089374","4603","19","Its place is in top 10 among action/comedy jewels."
"2842","tt0089374","4603","20","Finally it's been released in Russia on DVD the 2nd film has the best options the Chinese/Russian soundtracks and English/Russian subtitles."
"2843","tt0089374","4603","21","Solid 10 out of 10."
"2844","tt0089374","4603","22","Thank you for attention."
"2845","tt0089374","4604","1","This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10.. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no ""good plot"" or anything like that, thats ridiculous, saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot!"
"2846","tt0089374","4604","2","you watch Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES, for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other American films from that era and even later you will realize that Jackie Chan's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while American movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time."
"2847","tt0089374","4604","3","Porn is watched for the porn, Jackie Chan is watched for the ACTION, i think you people are rating it bad because there's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained."
"2848","tt0089374","4604","4","Sure the middle of the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that."
"2849","tt0089374","4604","5","This did change the way how American action movies were created, they have even stollen scenes from this movie."
"2850","tt0089374","4604","6","If you want a true man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan's, hes pure in everyway."
"2851","tt0089374","4604","7","He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park, and even in TODAYS movies."
"2852","tt0089374","4604","8","American movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more."
"2853","tt0089374","4604","9","Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece"
"2854","tt0089374","4605","1","This is not only one of the greatest Jackie Chan films, but also one of the greatest kung fu movies of all time."
"2855","tt0089374","4605","2","We've come to expect crazy stunts, and fast, creative action in Chan's movies, and this one set the benchmark for others to follow."
"2856","tt0089374","4605","3","It's two hours of pure entertainment, that impresses all the way through."
"2857","tt0089374","4605","4","As well as the superb action, we have a viable storyline and believable characters, with Chan taking what appears to be a more western approach to the writing, mixing eastern resolution methods ie kicking ass."
"2858","tt0089374","4605","5","Overall, it's funny, serious, entertaining and groundbreaking."
"2859","tt0089374","4605","6","A must for any kung fu fan, whilst at the same time remaining accessible to the wider reaches of the film community."
"2860","tt0089374","4606","1","Police Story is arguably one of the best works by the master of action himself."
"2861","tt0089374","4606","2","Compared to other action films,Police Story makes Schwarzenegger and Stallone look like beginners."
"2862","tt0089374","4606","3","The stunt scenes are well cheorgraphed and the action scenes are superb."
"2863","tt0089374","4606","4","If New Line Cinema has any sense,they would release this in theaters."
"2864","tt0089374","4607","1","My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be ""Drunken Master"" 1978, followed by this film from 1985, ""Police Story."""
"2865","tt0089374","4607","2","In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend Brigitte Lin so that she can turn state's evidence."
"2866","tt0089374","4607","3","As the story goes on, the gangster sends his goons to dispatch Lin, but Chan takes matters into his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung at bay."
"2867","tt0089374","4607","4","Like ""Drunken Master,"" ""Police Story"" has many of the signature stunts and over the top martial arts/action choreography that Chan has become famous for, climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall."
"2868","tt0089374","4607","5","In his role as director, Chan exceeds in excellence, giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action."
"2869","tt0089374","4607","6","While light on the overall slapstick humor of ""Drunken Master,"" at heart ""Police Story"" is just that, a police story, a gritty cop thriller that would be oft copied over the years to come.10/10"
"2870","tt0089374","4608","1","Jackie Chan is considered by many film and martial arts movie fans as one of the greatest action stars ever to grace the silver screen and Police Story cemented his reputation as the likely successor to the late, great Bruce Lee."
"2871","tt0089374","4608","2","If Enter The Dragon bared the so called bench mark of Lee's greatness in the 70s, then the same can be said about Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 80s."
"2872","tt0089374","4608","3","Forget about the Rush Hour trilogy, or any of his US efforts the one film that really typifies Chan's excellence, not to mention kick starting his status as a high kicking, bone crushing kung fu talisman, as well as his movie career was this, Police Story the first in a series of successful cop films, set in mainland, present day Hong Kong."
"2873","tt0089374","4608","4","I've seen many of his efforts likewise the US based Rush Hour, Rumble in the Bronx, The Medalian and The Tuxedo to name and frankly many of them pale into insignificance compared to Police Story."
"2874","tt0089374","4608","5","In those movies, we saw a less 'dumbed down' version of Jackie, of whom didn't get the opportunity to utilise his fighting abilities to the maximum, not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as Drunken Master, Police Story to name."
"2875","tt0089374","4608","6","The stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie."
"2876","tt0089374","4608","7","The shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and has to be seen to be believed: the flying shards of glass, Chan who is left dangling outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman frantically drives through the streets of the town, and Chan successfully making usage of all sorts of inanimate objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with."
"2877","tt0089374","4608","8","Considering he is known for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in harm's way, Jackie's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one, is somewhat of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert."
"2878","tt0089374","4608","9","Especially as he has the bruises to show for it."
"2879","tt0089374","4608","10","Thus, he has proved that he is no one trick pony when it comes down to devising and coming up with various and clever looking moves."
"2880","tt0089374","4608","11","Story wise, there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative, it makes up with its end to end action and fight sequences."
"2881","tt0089374","4608","12","As for the dialogue, well it's not a really huge aspect of the film which is why most fans of Jackie's and martial arts films are more interested in action, as opposed to the story."
"2882","tt0089374","4608","13","Unlike say The Matrix, there are no wires or CGI, or any form of computer trickery involved."
"2883","tt0089374","4608","14","What you see is what you get and what you get with Police Story is a great Jackie Chan epic, full of action and pulsating stunts."
"2884","tt0089374","4608","15","It is miles better than Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour and all his other American efforts."
"2885","tt0089374","4608","16","Police Story is an excellent film and one I'd definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice Jackie Chan fan, but of whom are unsure which one they should watch first."
"2886","tt0089374","4609","1","Probably Jackie Chan's best film in the 1980s, and the one that put him on the map."
"2887","tt0089374","4609","2","The scale of this self directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes, during which a squatters' village and shopping mall are demolished."
"2888","tt0089374","4609","3","There are, clearly, differences between the original Chinese and dubbed English versions, with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter."
"2889","tt0089374","4609","4","The latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their Chinese originals."
"2890","tt0089374","4609","5","In fact, the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trialat the time, trials in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English, while the original has this scene in Cantonese!"
"2891","tt0089374","4609","6","Nonetheless, Chan's fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible, so non Cantonese audiences don't miss much."
"2892","tt0089374","4609","7","It's not, after all, the dialogue that makes a Chan flick, but the action and the painful out takes."
"2893","tt0089374","4609","8","The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather Cho Yeun, and assigned to protect a star witness Brigitte Lin."
"2894","tt0089374","4609","9","The action is superb from beginning to end, and there's not much time to breathe in between."
"2895","tt0089374","4609","10","It'll never get you thinking, but what an entertaining, and well strung together, film."
"2896","tt0089374","4609","11","Arguably, this is one of the best martial arts films out there."
"2897","tt0089374","4610","1","A winters day, 28th December 1986, two bored 14 year olds hire a movie."
"2898","tt0089374","4610","2","""Hmmmm, Police Story, looks interesting"", ""who is this Jackie Chan."", ""never heard of him""."
"2899","tt0089374","4610","3","Two hours later after watching the film, in a daze, we wanted to know more. 16 years later and severely out of pocket from collecting JC movies!"
"2900","tt0089374","4610","4","the film still grabs me like no other."
"2901","tt0089374","4610","5","Ok, maybe I have a soft spot for it as it was my ""first"" Cannonball Run doesn't count!!"
"2902","tt0089374","4610","6","JC movie, but it is an excellent movie."
"2903","tt0089374","4610","7","It has all the classic JC elements, Action, Humour, Action, Heart and ACTION!"
"2904","tt0089374","4610","8","Some comments say it's dated, it was made in 1985, of course it's dated!"
"2905","tt0089374","4610","9","But then so must Jaws, Casablanca, Singin' in the Rain and The Godfather!!!!!!"
"2906","tt0089374","4610","10","Without movies like Police Story where would Hollywood action be today."
"2907","tt0089374","4610","11","PS set standards, many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies."
"2908","tt0089374","4610","12","To really fully appreciate it you must see it in widescreen, you miss so much of the movie otherwise yes, he really does fall off the bus going round the corner!."
"2909","tt0089374","4610","13","If you haven't already, SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!"
"2910","tt0089374","4611","1","Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release."
"2911","tt0089374","4611","2","Cantonese / English subtitlesOnce upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with 'The Matrix', and I was perhaps one of the few fifteen year olds left who still believed that 'Terminator' was better than 'Matrix'."
"2912","tt0089374","4611","3","I was but a simple teenage boy, looking for a good action movie, and then there was a shining light on a TV station I had never really watched, a little station known as SBS."
"2913","tt0089374","4611","4","One night I noticed in the TV guide that a movie starring Jackie Chan 'Police Story' would be on later."
"2914","tt0089374","4611","5","Being fifteen, and having only seen 'Rumble in the Bronx' and 'Rush Hour', I said..."
"2915","tt0089374","4611","6","""WOW AWESOME"" and sat down to watch it, and continually shouted ""WOW AWESOME"" as the movie progressed."
"2916","tt0089374","4611","7","Two weeks later, after SBS had shown the 'Police Story' trilogy, I knew I had found my new favourite actor."
"2917","tt0089374","4611","8","Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong cop who busts a major drug lord, Chu Yuen Chor."
"2918","tt0089374","4611","9","Chu's secretary, Selina Fong Brigitte Lin, is being held by the police as a witness against Chu, and Chan is assigned to protect her."
"2919","tt0089374","4611","10","Things go bad reaaaal bad when Chu's case is dismissed and he decides he wants Fong and Chan dead.'"
"2920","tt0089374","4611","11","Police Story' is one of the greatest action movies ever, and certainly one of my favourite Jackie Chan films."
"2921","tt0089374","4611","12","It starts off strong, and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed."
"2922","tt0089374","4611","13","Everything in between is great."
"2923","tt0089374","4611","14","However, some of the funny parts may seem a little tasteless to more than a few people..."
"2924","tt0089374","4611","15","As a story, this is still one of Jackie's better efforts."
"2925","tt0089374","4611","16","For an action movie, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is a much better actor in this than he is in the acting & plot intensive 'New Police Story'."
"2926","tt0089374","4611","17","This isn't 'Miracles', but maybe that's a good thing.'"
"2927","tt0089374","4611","18","Police Story' is one of Jackie's finest works."
"2928","tt0089374","4611","19","It got me hooked on Jackie Chan movies, and should provide a nice start for any potential Jackie fans."
"2929","tt0089374","4611","20","The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan movies don't come much better 10/10"
"2930","tt0092067","4053","1","I remember liking this more than Nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me."
"2931","tt0092067","4053","2","Laputa, whose title seems to have affected its release in the U.S. to avoid confusion to its wide Hispanic audiences, has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production Conan."
"2932","tt0092067","4053","3","In fact, Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then started running."
"2933","tt0092067","4053","4","This makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch."
"2934","tt0092067","4053","5","The techie fans of Nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out Laputa the only exception may be the robot."
"2935","tt0092067","4053","6","Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, the theme in Laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism."
"2936","tt0092067","4053","7","If it has a theme at all it's anti warfare."
"2937","tt0092067","4053","8","The importance of living naturally this is related with the flying castle, is dismissably shortly discussed, and not really followed through."
"2938","tt0092067","4053","9","Overall, I now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel good and corny."
"2939","tt0092067","4054","1","The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad."
"2940","tt0092067","4054","2","My dad actually recorded it off the TV."
"2941","tt0092067","4054","3","I must have watched is over 20 times, before the relatively recent release on DVD.I of course bought and watched the DVD and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed."
"2942","tt0092067","4054","4","In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark."
"2943","tt0092067","4054","5","However the new version, featuring Van Der Beek et al, is more comic."
"2944","tt0092067","4054","6","To put it another way, it's like watching the original US release of Akira with that dub, before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the Japanese."
"2945","tt0092067","4054","7","I'm in no way complaining, the story and quality of animation are not detracted from, but it does raise the question of whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film....."
"2946","tt0092067","4055","1","This film is amazing and I would recommend to child and adult alike."
"2947","tt0092067","4055","2","The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; far better than anything the American studios were producing at the time."
"2948","tt0092067","4055","3","However, there is a couple of caveats to this statement."
"2949","tt0092067","4055","4","It's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli back catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it."
"2950","tt0092067","4055","5","My main point being, Disney re dubbed the film, despite the original English version being very impressive."
"2951","tt0092067","4055","6","The new cast with Van Der Beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e.g."
"2952","tt0092067","4055","7","Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers."
"2953","tt0092067","4055","8","The Original music score is also far better than the Disney remix."
"2954","tt0092067","4055","9","It begs the question why did Disney make such changes."
"2955","tt0092067","4055","10","It seems to me is that by having Van Der Beek et al being cast then Disney can draw in more money, which is fair enough, but in the process they tainted they film."
"2956","tt0092067","4055","11","It is still a beautiful film and I would still recommend it to anyone."
"2957","tt0092067","4055","12","My main beef is that Disney ruined a film from childhood which I loved and still love."
"2958","tt0092067","4055","13","I am lucky enough to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub which I am now going to guard with my life!"
"2959","tt0092067","4056","1","Saw this on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was titled ""Laputa: Castle in the sky""."
"2960","tt0092067","4056","2","I had enabled subtitles and I think SBS provided their own for that, which, as usual, was of very good quality."
"2961","tt0092067","4056","3","Just looked up ""Laputa"" on Wikipedia and it confirms what I suspected...the floating island of this tale is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel ""Gulliver's travels"", which was published in the early to mid 1700s."
"2962","tt0092067","4056","4","Anyway, this is an engaging Japanese fairytale, which features an English speaking voice cast."
"2963","tt0092067","4056","5","It's suitable for young children, I think, but it does run at just over two hours in length, so it may be too long for some, though not for an adult like me."
"2964","tt0092067","4056","6","The story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island which has a castle on it."
"2965","tt0092067","4056","7","The children are not the only ones looking for this island."
"2966","tt0092067","4056","8","They have pirates, the army and spies looking for the island too, and looking to capture the children Sheeta, the girl, voiced by Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy, voiced by James Van Der Beek in order to help them find it."
"2967","tt0092067","4056","9","The graphics are magnificent...sort of photo realistic at times, especially the scenes of stonework lit by torch light, or the pretty scenes of bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or mist."
"2968","tt0092067","4056","10","Recommended."
"2969","tt0092067","4057","1","Like many Americans, I was first introduced to the works of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw ""Spirited Away."""
"2970","tt0092067","4057","2","I fell in love with the film and have seen it many times."
"2971","tt0092067","4057","3","Now I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki."
"2972","tt0092067","4057","4","One of his earlier works is ""Castle in the Sky."""
"2973","tt0092067","4057","5","Although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as ""Spirited Away"" though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair."
"2974","tt0092067","4057","6","A young boy named Pazu James Van Der Beek is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky."
"2975","tt0092067","4057","7","When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Sheeta Anna Paquin."
"2976","tt0092067","4057","8","But Sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, Pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city."
"2977","tt0092067","4057","9","Going into a film by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic."
"2978","tt0092067","4057","10","Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki."
"2979","tt0092067","4057","11","Watching a film by Miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood."
"2980","tt0092067","4057","12","Because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words."
"2981","tt0092067","4057","13","It also helps that the translated dialogue is well written and voiced by talented actors."
"2982","tt0092067","4057","14","The voice acting is varied."
"2983","tt0092067","4057","15","James Van Der Beek fares best."
"2984","tt0092067","4057","16","He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character."
"2985","tt0092067","4057","17","Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta."
"2986","tt0092067","4057","18","She's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do."
"2987","tt0092067","4057","19","Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska."
"2988","tt0092067","4057","20","He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything to get it."
"2989","tt0092067","4057","21","The other voices are bad."
"2990","tt0092067","4057","22","Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola."
"2991","tt0092067","4057","23","Leachman may have won an Oscar for ""The Last Picture Show,"" but she's annoying as the pirate leader."
"2992","tt0092067","4057","24","Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous."
"2993","tt0092067","4057","25","It's so bad it nearly ruins the film!"
"2994","tt0092067","4057","26","Jim Cummings is an effective voice over actor, but he's miscast as the general."
"2995","tt0092067","4057","27","I would definitely recommend seeing ""Castle in the Sky."""
"2996","tt0092067","4057","28","I'll probably end up buying it myself."
"2997","tt0092067","4057","29","But even though it's not as good as ""Spirited Away,"" it's still pretty good."
"2998","tt0092067","4058","1","Retitled from its original Japanese name of LAPUTA for being an offensive phrase, something which director Hayao Miyazaki was oblivious to at the time, CASTLE IN THE SKY is the master animator's third film, and it's one of his most beloved of all time."
"2999","tt0092067","4058","2","Initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release, it has since been embraced by critics and audiences around the world."
"3000","tt0092067","4058","3","Inspired by Jonathan Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels"", CASTLE IN THE SKY is a steampunk themed action adventure tale about two young orphans young miner Pazu, and mysterious girl Sheeta who wears a magic crystal around her neck who team up to find the long lost island of Laputa, which is rumored to have great riches and gems."
"3001","tt0092067","4058","4","They are aided by a band of bumbling yet sympathetic air pirates led by the feisty Dola who at first chase them, yet turn out to be true allies and pursued by the government headed by its villainous topmost secret agent, Muska, who wants the power of Laputa for his own benefit."
"3002","tt0092067","4058","5","For anyone looking for an exciting way to spend two hours, this film is an excellent choice, featuring just the right amount of humor, exploration, wonder, and mystery to keep one interested."
"3003","tt0092067","4058","6","The artwork, although not as spectacular as in some of Miyazaki's later movies, is fantastic and gorgeous enough to watch with imaginative characters and locations, incredibly exciting action scenes, and breathtaking flight sequences that will make one feel giddy."
"3004","tt0092067","4058","7","And while the characters that populate this tale are less complex than Miyazaki's other works, each has a memorable, endearing personality that stays with the viewer long after the film is over."
"3005","tt0092067","4058","8","Dola, in particular, makes for a terrific comic character, shouting orders to her dimwitted sons one moment and being protective of Sheeta the next."
"3006","tt0092067","4058","9","Muska is one of the few Miyazaki creations to ever come across as an irredeemable villain, but like Dola, he commands every scene he's in with a sinister charisma that is both alluring and chilly."
"3007","tt0092067","4058","10","Anime fans have often compared this movie to Gainax's sci fi adventure series NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER."
"3008","tt0092067","4058","11","After all, both works share similar story and character elements... not to mention that they were both created by Miyazaki himself."
"3009","tt0092067","4058","12","Where both differ is in their execution."
"3010","tt0092067","4058","13","NADIA, although charming for the most part, suffered from taking a wrong turn at its midway point, devolving into cartoonish nonsense which all but distracted from the main plot, even though it did have a strong ending."
"3011","tt0092067","4058","14","CASTLE IN THE SKY, on the other hand, remains consistently entertaining and focused for its two hour running time, and is all the better for it."
"3012","tt0092067","4058","15","While the film's epic tone is sometimes broken up by some ""cartoonish"" moments, like a brawl between Pazu's boss and one of Dola's sons, it's never to the point that it detracts from the film."
"3013","tt0092067","4058","16","About eleven years ago, Disney released an English version featuring a cast of big names such as James van der Beek, Anna Paquin, Cloris Leachman, Mark Hamill, Mandy Patinkin as well as some cameo appearances by veterans such as Tress MacNeille and Jim Cummings."
"3014","tt0092067","4058","17","It also features an ambitious reworking of Joe Hisaishi's gorgeous musical score for a performance by the Seattle Music Orchestra interestingly, the man behind this rescore is none other than the composer himself."
"3015","tt0092067","4058","18","As much as purists have cried blasphemy over this version for its occasional extra dialogue and the aforementioned rescore, Miyazaki had no such problems; in fact, he is said to have applauded the reworking, and for good reason, because the newly rerecorded music is truly the star of the new dub."
"3016","tt0092067","4058","19","While there are some instances where filling in some critially silent scenes from the original Japanese is a bit jarring notably the journey through a dragon infested storm cloud, the overall reworking is fantastic and in many ways improves on the original, particularly in scenes such as when a robot attacks a fortress and the climactic moments toward the end."
"3017","tt0092067","4058","20","Here, Hisaishi displays his musical versatility and genius for matching music to visuals."
"3018","tt0092067","4058","21","As far as the performances in the dub go, the leads are probably at the short end of the stick; James Van Der Beek's Pazu sounds significantly more mature than his character, while Anna Paquin's Sheeta speaks with an odd accent that fluctuates at times a problem which actually works in favor of the character."
"3019","tt0092067","4058","22","That said, both do good jobs overall and provide a fairly believable chemistry throughout."
"3020","tt0092067","4058","23","It's the lively supporting cast, however, that really make this dub so much fun, particularly Cloris Leachman's Dola and Mark Hamill's Muska."
"3021","tt0092067","4058","24","Both are perfectly cast and steal every scene they're in; as with the rescore, these two really warrant a listen to the Disney dub."
"3022","tt0092067","4058","25","The script adaptation borders on the loose side at times there's quite a bit of extra lines and/or commentary some of which are pricelessly funny and others somewhat overdone but aside from at least one debatable alteration Sheeta's speech in the climactic showdown ""the world cannot live without love"" as opposed to the original ""you can't survive apart from Mother Earth"", the overall characters, story, and spirit remain fairly faithful to the original."
"3023","tt0092067","4058","26","On the whole, there is little point comparing the Disney version to the original language track; each puts their own stamp on this legendary masterpiece, and I like them both."
"3024","tt0092067","4058","27","They're also better than Streamline/JAL's more literal but frightfully robotic, lifeless, abysmally acted and poorly written older dub from the late 1980's; don't believe anybody who says this version is ""superior"" to Disneys trust me, the opposite is true."
"3025","tt0092067","4058","28","Either way, though, you can't go wrong with CASTLE IN THE SKY."
"3026","tt0092067","4058","29","It's one of Miyazaki's all time greatest, and I highly recommend it."
"3027","tt0092067","4059","1","The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic, this is more of an action comedy adventure with a fairly weak SF premise."
"3028","tt0092067","4059","2","For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it."
"3029","tt0092067","4059","3","Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection."
"3030","tt0092067","4059","4","The animation, though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa."
"3031","tt0092067","4059","5","I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque' anime style."
"3032","tt0092067","4059","6","Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates."
"3033","tt0092067","4059","7","They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure."
"3034","tt0092067","4059","8","There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it."
"3035","tt0092067","4059","9","Still. having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film even if she's basically a female Long John Silver."
"3036","tt0092067","4059","10","Don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'Treasure Planet' at times and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub."
"3037","tt0092067","4059","11","The English voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually."
"3038","tt0092067","4059","12","However something started going pear shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark."
"3039","tt0092067","4059","13","I think the best way that I could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story."
"3040","tt0092067","4059","14","I'll come back to that later."
"3041","tt0092067","4059","15","There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'."
"3042","tt0092067","4059","16","It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag."
"3043","tt0092067","4059","17","The crucial thing for me was this: I really found that I didn't care much about any of the characters."
"3044","tt0092067","4059","18","Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie."
"3045","tt0092067","4059","19","Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals."
"3046","tt0092067","4059","20","That's where Laputa falls down as far as I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie."
"3047","tt0092067","4059","21","Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'Great Mouse Detective'."
"3048","tt0092067","4059","22","Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but I do feel it's over rated."
"3049","tt0092067","4059","23","I definitely prefer the earlier 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'."
"3050","tt0092067","4059","24","BTW, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox squirrel from Nausicaa popping up briefly in Laputa."
"3051","tt0092067","4060","1","It is an almost ideal romantic anime!"
"3052","tt0092067","4060","2","MUST SEE FOR ALL AGES!"
"3053","tt0092067","4060","3","But the English dubbed version is not too good."
"3054","tt0092067","4060","4","Perhaps the 1999 version will be better."
"3055","tt0092067","4061","1","This is the best dub I've ever heard by Disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service."
"3056","tt0092067","4061","2","UrrrghhhThis one has different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine."
"3057","tt0092067","4061","3","This one has both hero and heroine although I don't really endorse the use of hero & heroine here, since Miyazaki is out from the stereotype & common theme."
"3058","tt0092067","4061","4","As usual, after being introduced by Spirited away, amazed by Mononoke, troubled by Grave of Fireflies, and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin , this one start with a bit doubt in my part."
"3059","tt0092067","4061","5","Wondering if this will be the first Ghibi's dud."
"3060","tt0092067","4061","6","Well, in the end just like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up giving 10 rating."
"3061","tt0092067","4061","7","I'd give 9.8 rating, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie."
"3062","tt0092067","4061","8","SPOILER Somehow I see this as a sad movie, people die in this one, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and it ends with destruction."
"3063","tt0092067","4061","9","It is as if mankind really can't live with too much power."
"3064","tt0092067","4061","10","The collapsing scene gave me patches of Metropolis ending."
"3065","tt0092067","4061","11","It's just sad somehow."
"3066","tt0092067","4061","12","The plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well as always."
"3067","tt0092067","4061","13","Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber."
"3068","tt0092067","4061","14","People who can brings a movie, a game, an event to life, even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition."
"3069","tt0092067","4061","15","This is a feel good movie that used to be part of US cinema in the classic days It's a Wonderful Life etc etc."
"3070","tt0092067","4061","16","Well, things change...."
"3071","tt0092067","4062","1","I just realised I've been using IMDb for years now and I've never reviewed my favourite film."
"3072","tt0092067","4062","2","By favourite I don't mean something I like for now, I mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it."
"3073","tt0092067","4062","3","This is obvious because I am never going to be a child again; I saw this film on ITV in the early nineties."
"3074","tt0092067","4062","4","I was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at, I'm also male, the gender that this film is intended for the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are female."
"3075","tt0092067","4062","5","Consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and I am forever indebted to Carl Macek sp. for producing the English dub of this film which is far superior to the Di$ney production which is not even funny I've never even been able to watch that one of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the Macek version is SO good the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original Japanese actors that this version is available on the Japanese DVD!"
"3076","tt0092067","4062","6","It's not available on any distribution in an English speaking country."
"3077","tt0092067","4062","7","Go figure."
"3078","tt0092067","4062","8","There are hundreds of competent reviews so I'm going to put some trivia here, not that I'm the definitive archive of information for this film."
"3079","tt0092067","4062","9","First up I'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's films they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on IMDb combined pale into insignificance."
"3080","tt0092067","4062","10","The fascinating story with this film is that Miyazaki based the countryside around Slag's Ravine Pazu's town area on the Welsh mining communities."
"3081","tt0092067","4062","11","He visited Wales for a few months in the early 80s might be late 70s just after one of the great mining strikes."
"3082","tt0092067","4062","12","Being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight."
"3083","tt0092067","4062","13","The fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man."
"3084","tt0092067","4062","14","The countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where I grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest British Isles."
"3085","tt0092067","4062","15","The island is of course from Swift's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century the story in Swift's book is, deliberately, ridiculous."
"3086","tt0092067","4062","16","In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki weaves together myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel I think the architecture in addition is based on Peruvian ruins though I'm not sure, someone told me that."
"3087","tt0092067","4062","17","Anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film REALLY will want to check out Miyazaki's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan Future Boy Conan based on the short sci fi novel 'The Incredible Tide' by Alexander key novel is available online."
"3088","tt0092067","4062","18","Conan is basically a prototype for Laputa's Pazu and Shita."
"3089","tt0092067","4062","19","In addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for Masterpiece Theatre some of his key frame animation."
"3090","tt0092067","4062","20","He also did key frame for Sherlock Hound this has some of the finest backgrounds I've ever seen too."
"3091","tt0092067","4062","21","Also check out Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film Horus Prince of the Sun 1968 amazing by today's standards in fact."
"3092","tt0092067","4062","22","What else..."
"3093","tt0092067","4062","23","Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship though they're pretty rare."
"3094","tt0092067","4062","24","This film is such a gift, I don't know what we'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around, this is like an oasis."
"3095","tt0092067","4062","25","Arigatou Miyazaki sensei!"
"3096","tt0092067","4063","1","Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film."
"3097","tt0092067","4063","2","After seeing it for the first time I'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint."
"3098","tt0092067","4063","3","On the contrary, you get your time's worth, which means as to what Miyazaki's films are concern, that is nothing less than excellent!"
"3099","tt0092067","4063","4","Produced early in his cinematic career, Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies, with strong but young female characters, forced to grow up due to external circumstances, helped out by very interesting and some times lovable supporting characters."
"3100","tt0092067","4063","5","And, of course, the usual battle of nature versus civilization, flying machines lots of it!!, beautiful painted sceneries but alas, no pigs at least that i've noticed, after all I have only seen it once."
"3101","tt0092067","4063","6","Never the less, Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier, with Nausicãa, which was a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus."
"3102","tt0092067","4063","7","Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two, with a soft action packed first 30 minutes, resembling his TV series Conan, and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes."
"3103","tt0092067","4063","8","In here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, only to be found by Pazu, a young boy working in a little countryside mining town."
"3104","tt0092067","4063","9","Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from, whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates."
"3105","tt0092067","4063","10","As the movie progresses, the plot gets heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at his best."
"3106","tt0092067","4063","11","The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away, or vice versa, as Castle in the sky was produced first, and much like its director, Joe Hisaishi _the composer_ starts with a very light score, that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward!"
"3107","tt0092067","4063","12","A note to the English dubbing, with a good interpretation from the two lead stars, although Anna Paquin's Sheeta has a very thick accent which the actress still had at that point in her career, and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska, making up for a delighting yet devilish villain!"
"3108","tt0092067","4063","13","Don't miss this one people!"
"3109","tt0092067","4064","1","I never met a single person out of hundreds who hated this movie."
"3110","tt0092067","4064","2","Bet that anyone who votes it down is a petty saboteur, or a victim of one."
"3111","tt0092067","4064","3","This film has everything."
"3112","tt0092067","4064","4","Ask yourself, ""Are you a fan of. . . ."""
"3113","tt0092067","4064","5","Then go see ""Laputa""."
"3114","tt0092067","4064","6","It's not my favorite movie, but my favorite IS directed by the same person Hayao Miyazaki."
"3115","tt0092067","4064","7","In any case, this one ranks among my top five."
"3116","tt0092067","4064","8","And I've seen a LOT of movies."
"3117","tt0092067","4065","1","I've seen the original English version on video."
"3118","tt0092067","4065","2","Disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising."
"3119","tt0092067","4065","3","I can't believe I'm saying that."
"3120","tt0092067","4065","4","The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own."
"3121","tt0092067","4065","5","The two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film."
"3122","tt0092067","4065","6","The animation quality is excellent!"
"3123","tt0092067","4065","7","If you've seen Disney's job of Kiki's delivery service you can see the quality in their production."
"3124","tt0092067","4065","8","It almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion. but not quite!"
"3125","tt0092067","4065","9","Finally Miyazaki's films are being released properly!"
"3126","tt0092067","4065","10","I can't wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa!"
"3127","tt0092067","4066","1","Lapyuta Castle in the Sky, more than any of Hayao Miyazaki's movies, brings the joy of storytelling to the audience."
"3128","tt0092067","4066","2","It is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again; it's just magical."
"3129","tt0092067","4066","3","It's a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states, but now that it's here check it out!"
"3130","tt0092067","4066","4","And stick with the original language; the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie or book, whatever."
"3131","tt0092067","4066","5","I give it a ten/ten."
"3132","tt0092067","4067","1","Hayao Miyazaki's second feature film, and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically though his debut Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best, 'Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta' AKA 'Castle in the Sky' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Mononoke hime' and 'Spirited Away', but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime."
"3133","tt0092067","4067","2","It's important to remember that 'Castle in the Sky' was made two years before the revolutionary 'Akira', and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece, the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters, and the story is quite predictable and obvious at least in today's standards, Miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before."
"3134","tt0092067","4067","3","While the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times, the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable if not as breathtaking as 'Spirited Away'."
"3135","tt0092067","4067","4","And if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces at this point Miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of Japanese cartooning you'll see Miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on 'Spirited Away' and Mononoke."
"3136","tt0092067","4067","5","While 'Castle in the Sky', being a sci fi adventure and very suitable for children, fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since, his motifs and principles still show and play an important part."
"3137","tt0092067","4067","6","To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up."
"3138","tt0092067","4067","7","Suffice to say that I'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn't go any higher for 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke'."
"3139","tt0092067","4067","8","And that would be a crime."
"3140","tt0092067","4067","9","As in most anime movies, I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese the English overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous."
"3141","tt0092067","4067","10","You might want to watch it in the English version once, though, just for the laughs, and for the star filled cast the English dub was only recorded following the success of 'Spirited Away', as it was for 'Kiki's Delivery Service' Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek Yeah, the Dawson guy!"
"3142","tt0092067","4067","11","fill the lead roles, Mark Hamill Luke Skywalker from 'Star Wars', in case you don't know!"
"3143","tt0092067","4067","12","plays the villain, and other roles are filled by Andy Dick, Tres MacNeille The Simpsons, Rugrats, Animaniacs..., Michael McShane Friar Tuck from Kevin Costner's Robin Hood travesty and Mandy Patinkin Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya..."
"3144","tt0092067","4067","13","Good for a laugh, or a few laughs really."
"3145","tt0092067","4067","14","But watch the Japanese one first."
"3146","tt0092067","4068","1","breathtaking, this is without doubt the best anime cartoon ever made. i first saw castle in the sky in the late 80s as a child and it left a lasting impression. years went by and i forgot the title of the film, and only by chance browsing on the internet i found this masterpiece again. after reading other peoples reviews and analysis I'm not surprised it has such acclaim and touched so many because it does leave an impression. a true fantasy adventure, a must see for all children and adults. its best not giving the story away so i would say watch this movie will a clear and open mind. if you have kids treat them to this i promise you they will love it. there's not much to say about this piece of art but if you've not seen it watch it and enjoy."
"3147","tt0092067","4069","1","Listening to the soundtrack at the moment, the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong in order to be able to type this."
"3148","tt0092067","4069","2","I've seen it twice thus far, and I should be ashamed for having seen it only twice."
"3149","tt0092067","4069","3","I've seen all Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli films, and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces except maybe for Nausicaa which was, even in the non cut up version too premature compared to the nec plus ultra manga."
"3150","tt0092067","4069","4","Still, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to get too naive/positive Chihiro, or, with more nuance, a bit too explicit/moralist Mononoke."
"3151","tt0092067","4069","5","At least, compared to for example the other Ghibli master Takahata Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars."
"3152","tt0092067","4069","6","But not this one."
"3153","tt0092067","4069","7","In Laputa, Miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages, combined with a bit of morale, but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with the humor and amusement of for example Totoro."
"3154","tt0092067","4069","8","Every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties."
"3155","tt0092067","4069","9","The pacing is so perfect that I know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being."
"3156","tt0092067","4069","10","The story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone, and the main theme kicks in, you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to uncover, but the story then settles and gradually, over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty, builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty like, following days of sombre gloom, finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning, knowing the path walked, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it."
"3157","tt0092067","4069","11","It is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb, you should see a therapist."
"3158","tt0092067","4069","12","Despite the fact that technically image wise some more recent Miyazakis might be more overwhelming, this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece."
"3159","tt0092067","4069","13","If you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986, you can only come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years."
"3160","tt0092067","4069","14","This of course has been suggested before, but to me this is his only film that can, on its own, fully illustrate that simple fact."
"3161","tt0092067","4069","15","If you miss this during your lifetime, you'll die with a huge gap which would be a pity, as the coffin costs the same."
"3162","tt0092067","4070","1","I know Anime."
"3163","tt0092067","4070","2","I've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon; i loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z even was."
"3164","tt0092067","4070","3","And just so you know I'm not bragging about my, let me say this: out of all the animes I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best."
"3165","tt0092067","4070","4","It's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree."
"3166","tt0092067","4070","5","Most people only know that movie because it one an Acedmy Award; this isn't an exaggeration I've shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who'd only ever seen Spirited Away, and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three."
"3167","tt0092067","4070","6","Personally, I'd never thought that anything could compare to Princess Mononoke, until I finally saw Castle in the Sky."
"3168","tt0092067","4070","7","I still think that the prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with it; in many ways, Castle has major elements that Mononoke was missing."
"3169","tt0092067","4070","8","In either case, if you've only seen Spirited Away, and think that that is Miyazaki's best film, be prepared to have your earth shaken."
"3170","tt0092067","4071","1","I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called. now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a little hazy I was in no way disappointed by what I saw. the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone."
"3171","tt0092067","4071","2","But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike. with a floating island, a mad general, a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down I would recommend this film to any one."
"3172","tt0092067","4072","1","Hayao Miyazaki name became prominent with Spitied Away, however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts."
"3173","tt0092067","4072","2","Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138."
"3174","tt0092067","4072","3","I remember seeing fragments of this movie almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation."
"3175","tt0092067","4072","4","So when I found a copy in a well known store for £9 I couldn't resist but buy it."
"3176","tt0092067","4072","5","The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it memory is funny that way."
"3177","tt0092067","4072","6","Viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud some of the artwork is."
"3178","tt0092067","4072","7","I can only assume some influence here."
"3179","tt0092067","4072","8","When Pazu catches a falling girl Sheeta his adventure really begins the quest for Laputa a reference to Jonathan Swift's overlooked portion of Gulliver's Travels."
"3180","tt0092067","4072","9","With healthy references to Jules Verne it's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on Laputa."
"3181","tt0092067","4072","10","This is the portion that is strongest in my memory the 'pastoral' ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree."
"3182","tt0092067","4072","11","This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie the views of the surface of Laputa, as opposed to the mechanised underground."
"3183","tt0092067","4072","12","Although this is the dichotomy of this movie to show that even technology cannot overcome nature the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals."
"3184","tt0092067","4072","13","The ending of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same."
"3185","tt0092067","4072","14","It is incredibly stylish, I would not say 'slick' very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, airships and the design and look of just about everything."
"3186","tt0092067","4072","15","Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japnanese anime."
"3187","tt0092067","4072","16","Buy this movie and treasure it."
"3188","tt0092067","4073","1","Have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own, with one of your closest friends at your side, facing all sorts of dangers and villains, and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets."
"3189","tt0092067","4073","2","Even if you're not quite that much of a fantasy lover, have you ever wished you could simply experience what it's like to be a kid again, and not have a care in the world, for just a couple of hours."
"3190","tt0092067","4073","3","This is exactly what Miyazaki's ""Castle in the Sky"" is all about."
"3191","tt0092067","4073","4","Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day, a girl named Sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds, while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail."
"3192","tt0092067","4073","5","Simply put, it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another, and I can't help but feel my worries melt away every time I see it."
"3193","tt0092067","4073","6","As it is one of Miyazaki's older works and takes much place in the everyday world, the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, or even Princess Mononoke."
"3194","tt0092067","4073","7","Still, I find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other, because all three of those films are, at some point or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not perplexing, especially for the youngest of viewers."""
"3195","tt0092067","4073","8","Castle in the Sky"", on the other hand, doesn't try so much to be an allegory of any kind, and it's not a coming of age story either; it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child's mind I've ever seen."
"3196","tt0092067","4073","9","Not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of perspective from the kids' eyes is just amazing; whether it's the panning up of the ""camera"" to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead, or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I just can't help but FEEL like I'm there with Pazu and Sheeta, just a kid in another world, far far away from reality."
"3197","tt0092067","4073","10","Even the kids themselves don't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like Ashitaka/San or Chihiro/Haku; Sheeta is Pazu's angel, having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day, the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start."
"3198","tt0092067","4073","11","As the film progresses, more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions."
"3199","tt0092067","4073","12","Not only are they an adorable reminder of who I used to be, but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film, only growing stronger all the way to the last frame."
"3200","tt0092067","4073","13","For that reason, I've fallen in love with the two of them more than I have with any other Miyazaki couple."
"3201","tt0092067","4073","14","At the same time, ""Castle in the Sky"" is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be, you'll be sure to find your fix here."
"3202","tt0092067","4073","15","Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, sci fi, romance, even some western...it's all here, just about everything people go to the movies for except maybe horror."
"3203","tt0092067","4073","16","This why I can easily recommend it as a first Miyazaki film; it's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works."
"3204","tt0092067","4073","17","Even the ending song of the film, when translated into English, conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization, and some kind of soul mate, that could not be found in our mundane lives."
"3205","tt0092067","4073","18","""The reason I long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them..."
"3206","tt0092067","4073","19","The earth spins, carrying you, carrying us both who'll surely meet."""
"3207","tt0092067","4073","20","Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of Joe Hiasashi's gorgeous scores, but this is the only one I've seen that's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream."
"3208","tt0092067","4073","21","I have found myself near tears just listening to it."""
"3209","tt0092067","4073","22","Castle in the Sky"" may not be Miyazaki's most developed, spectacular, or meaningful work, but it's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be: a true vision of childhood fantasy, and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids."
"3210","tt0092067","4073","23","Sit back, relax, and love it for what it is."
"3211","tt0092067","4074","1","It's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being 'the best,' whether of all time, a certain genre, or what have you, but I believe a strong argument could be made that in fact, Laputa is the greatest animated film ever made."
"3212","tt0092067","4074","2","It is in my mind the masterwork of Hayao Miyazaki, the most talented of Japan's animated directors, and it best captures his strengths as a director, storyteller, and designer, as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes."
"3213","tt0092067","4074","3","The version I'm reviewing is the 2003 American dub I know, sacrilege for a hard core anime fan to not watch it in its native language; there is at least one other English language dub out there, I have it on VHS I have no idea from what source, and that version is the single best dub I have ever encountered of any film."
"3214","tt0092067","4074","4","But I thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find."
"3215","tt0092067","4074","5","Laputa tells the story of a boy named Pazu voiced by James Van Der Beek here, who's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named Sheeta Anna Paquin literally drops from the sky."
"3216","tt0092067","4074","6","It seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent, Colonel Muska Mark Hamill, who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck."
"3217","tt0092067","4074","7","To keep things lively, there's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal, led by the aging but still boisterous Dola Cloris Leachman."
"3218","tt0092067","4074","8","The plot revolves around the crystal's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of Laputa, a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure."
"3219","tt0092067","4074","9","It's all very much in keeping with a fairy tale setting, but Miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story, and the plot is peppered with 'gosh wow' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature."
"3220","tt0092067","4074","10","The design work on Laputa, nearly twenty years later, is still revolutionary."
"3221","tt0092067","4074","11","Flying machines of all sorts abound, utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking."
"3222","tt0092067","4074","12","The world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century, with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines."
"3223","tt0092067","4074","13","But it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution; Laputa is both the Garden of Eden and the Fire of Heaven itself, and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal, its power, and its danger."
"3224","tt0092067","4074","14","Besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film, Laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography."
"3225","tt0092067","4074","15","From sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water, Laputa displays a scope that most films  even with the magic of CGI  can only daydream about."
"3226","tt0092067","4074","16","Though we only see a small fraction of this world, its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it."
"3227","tt0092067","4074","17","The film also contains one of my favorite, if not the most exciting, action sequences ever: a guardian robot that fell to Earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in, all the while trying to protect Sheeta who was the one who woke it up."
"3228","tt0092067","4074","18","Meanwhile, Pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her, literally, from the jaws of destruction."
"3229","tt0092067","4074","19","From the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last second rescue, the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience."
"3230","tt0092067","4074","20","It helps that Laputa has an amazing score."
"3231","tt0092067","4074","21","Composer Joe Hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world, the dewy innocence, the exciting action, and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians."
"3232","tt0092067","4074","22","Though he re recorded it for this DVD release which IMO is not an improvement over his original score, adding pieces here and there, the score matches the visuals perfectly, a rare total union of sound and vision."
"3233","tt0092067","4074","23","This isn't a bad dub."
"3234","tt0092067","4074","24","I'm inordinately fond of the older English dub, and this one over explains things just a tad in spots, but I was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those and those matched the Japanese pretty well."
"3235","tt0092067","4074","25","Dola in particular is hard to get right, but Leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman her sons aren't quite as good as the original."
"3236","tt0092067","4074","26","Paquin does a good job as Sheeta, and Mark Hamill, while I knew it was him early, is more than talented enough to do Muska I liked the other English dub of Muska a little more, but Hamill's good."
"3237","tt0092067","4074","27","Much of the film rests on Pazu's shoulders, and Van Der Beek is wonderful."
"3238","tt0092067","4074","28","Listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other English dub, because VDB matches up very closely with the original Pazu."
"3239","tt0092067","4074","29","Although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful, as much as I love this film, I don't think you're sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular Anglicized version."
"3240","tt0092067","4074","30","John Lassiter of Pixar introduces it up front, and my suspicion is that he, like so many others, simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality."
"3241","tt0092067","4074","31","Miyazaki has had success in America in recent years with Spirited Away and Mononoke one of his few films I didn't care for, but to me Laputa is still his crowning achievement."
"3242","tt0092067","4074","32","Anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work, and again, this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder."
"3243","tt0092067","4074","33","I'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen; while that will probably never happen, it's good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on DVD."
"3244","tt0092067","4075","1","Laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb."
"3245","tt0092067","4075","2","The message is as strong as his newer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better!"
"3246","tt0092067","4075","3","The art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after this, im not sure if this was the first time i heard it and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack."
"3247","tt0092067","4075","4","Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy, Pazu is also a great role model he lives on his own!"
"3248","tt0092067","4075","5","The plot is classic Miyazaki."
"3249","tt0092067","4075","6","I won't give it away, but the end is really great."
"3250","tt0092067","4075","7","I rank this as one of Miyazaki's three best with Nausicaa and Spirited Away."
"3251","tt0092067","4075","8","Also you may want to check out Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out sometime next year i hope If you like Miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the USA."
"3252","tt0092067","4075","9","Enjoy, Piper A"
"3253","tt0092067","4076","1","By now you've probably heard a bit about the new Disney dub of Miyazaki's classic film, Laputa: Castle In The Sky."
"3254","tt0092067","4076","2","During late summer of 1998, Disney released ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" on video which included a preview of the Laputa dub saying it was due out in ""1999""."
"3255","tt0092067","4076","3","It's obviously way past that year now, but the dub has been finally completed."
"3256","tt0092067","4076","4","And it's not ""Laputa: Castle In The Sky"", just ""Castle In The Sky"" for the dub, since Laputa is not such a nice word in Spanish even though they use the word Laputa many times throughout the dub."
"3257","tt0092067","4076","5","You've also probably heard that world renowned composer, Joe Hisaishi, who scored the movie originally, went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements."
"3258","tt0092067","4076","6","Laputa came out before My Neighbor Totoro and after Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which began Studio Ghibli and it's long string of hits."
"3259","tt0092067","4076","7","And in my opinion, I think it's one of Miyazaki's best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem."
"3260","tt0092067","4076","8","Laputa: Castle in the Sky is a film for all ages and I urge everyone to see it."
"3261","tt0092067","4076","9","For those unfamiliar with Castle in the Sky's story, it begins right at the start and doesn't stop for the next two hours."
"3262","tt0092067","4076","10","The storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted, you see Miyazaki's true vision."
"3263","tt0092067","4076","11","And believe me, it's one fantastic one."
"3264","tt0092067","4076","12","The film begins with Sheeta, a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship."
"3265","tt0092067","4076","13","Sheeta holds the key to Laputa, the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization."
"3266","tt0092067","4076","14","The key to Laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many, namely the government, the military and the air pirate group, the Dola gang who Sheeta and Pazu later befriend."
"3267","tt0092067","4076","15","Soon, the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid."
"3268","tt0092067","4076","16","She falls a few thousand feet, but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant."
"3269","tt0092067","4076","17","As she floats down from the sky, Pazu, an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines, sees Sheeta and catches her."
"3270","tt0092067","4076","18","The two become fast friends, but thanks to her pendant, the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the Dola gang and government try to capture Sheeta."
"3271","tt0092067","4076","19","One action sequence after another, we learn all of the character's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue."
"3272","tt0092067","4076","20","Plus somewhat twisty surprise."
"3273","tt0092067","4076","21","I think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time."
"3274","tt0092067","4076","22","The story is wonderful, as we peak into Hayao Miyazaki's animation which has no limits."
"3275","tt0092067","4076","23","The setting of the film is a combo of many time periods."
"3276","tt0092067","4076","24","It does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s, but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons."
"3277","tt0092067","4076","25","Laputa is also surprisingly a funny film."
"3278","tt0092067","4076","26","The film has tons of hilarious moments, almost equal to the drama and action the film holds."
"3279","tt0092067","4076","27","I think the funniest part is a fight scene where Pazu's boss faces off against a pirate, and soon after a riot breaks out."
"3280","tt0092067","4076","28","It's funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly."
"3281","tt0092067","4076","29","Now let's talk about how the dub rates."
"3282","tt0092067","4076","30","An excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life."
"3283","tt0092067","4076","31","Teen heartthrob James Van Der Beek plays the hero Pazu, who has a much more mature voice then in the Japanese version, where in the original he sounded more childlike."
"3284","tt0092067","4076","32","Either way, I think his voice is a nice fit with Pazu."
"3285","tt0092067","4076","33","Anna Paquin, the young Oscar winner from ""The Piano"", plays Sheeta."
"3286","tt0092067","4076","34","This is also a nice performance, but the voice is a bit uneven, she doesn't stay true to one accent."
"3287","tt0092067","4076","35","At times she sounds as American as apple pie, but at other times she sounds like someone from New Zealand."
"3288","tt0092067","4076","36","The performance I most enjoyed however was of Coris Leachman, who played Mama Dola."
"3289","tt0092067","4076","37","Not only is this an excellent performance, but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life."
"3290","tt0092067","4076","38","If there was ever a live action Laputa movie G d forbid, she would be the one to play her, you can just imagine her in the role well, somewhat."
"3291","tt0092067","4076","39","Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill is Muska, and this is another top rate Hamill performance."
"3292","tt0092067","4076","40","You may be familiar with Hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original Star Wars movies, but he renders Muska to full evil."
"3293","tt0092067","4076","41","His voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the Joker, who he played for many episodes on the animated Batman series."
"3294","tt0092067","4076","42","Rounding out the cast is voice character actor Jim Cummings, who does a great, gruff job as the general and Andy Dick and Mandy Patakin as members of the Dola gang."
"3295","tt0092067","4076","43","Now let me talk about what really makes this dub special, Joe Hisaishi's newly arranged music!"
"3296","tt0092067","4076","44","For those who have never heard of him, Mr."
"3297","tt0092067","4076","45","Hisaishi does the music and like all of Miyazaki's films, the music is very memorable."
"3298","tt0092067","4076","46","Each of his scores has it's own personas which fits the particular film perfectly."
"3299","tt0092067","4076","47","Now, these new arrangements he has done are more ""American like"", which I think was the goal of the new recordings."
"3300","tt0092067","4076","48","Don't worry, the classic tunes of the Japanese version are still here in great form."
"3301","tt0092067","4076","49","The score, to me, sounds to be arranged like this is a Hollywood blockbuster."
"3302","tt0092067","4076","50","It has more power, it has more emphasis, it's clearer and deeper."
"3303","tt0092067","4076","51","The film's prologue, the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships, has some new music I am not sure, but I believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all."
"3304","tt0092067","4076","52","But a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy."
"3305","tt0092067","4076","53","Things seem very enhanced."
"3306","tt0092067","4076","54","In a powerful scene, the music is more stronger then in the original versions."
"3307","tt0092067","4076","55","In a calm scene, it's more calmer."
"3308","tt0092067","4076","56","Overall, I think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes, I highly did myself, and personally think it helps improve the film."
"3309","tt0092067","4076","57","I prefer the new score over the old one, and I hope Disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack."
"3310","tt0092067","4076","58","Another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful, and much of the original Japanese lines are intact."
"3311","tt0092067","4076","59","In Kiki, I'm sure a few lines where changed, and this is the same way, lines have been changed."
"3312","tt0092067","4076","60","But a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue Miyazaki has written."
"3313","tt0092067","4076","61","I was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered, but they were there intact."
"3314","tt0092067","4076","62","Some new lines have been added as well which help out."
"3315","tt0092067","4076","63","But I am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing, Disney DID NOT translate the ending song, it was in Japanese."
"3316","tt0092067","4076","64","I was mortified when they did completely new songs for the Kiki dub, but with this version it's the original song... in Japanese."
"3317","tt0092067","4076","65","So I guess it's good it's still the original, but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak English."
"3318","tt0092067","4076","66","There is a big down side to this dub, and it deals with how the voices match the character's lips."
"3319","tt0092067","4076","67","Of course in any dub it won't be perfect, but I think in Kiki and Mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed and Disney had a little bit more time with this one...."
"3320","tt0092067","4076","68","Some of the time everything matches perfect, some of the time it doesn't completley match, and in a rare case, someone says something and the lips don't move at all there's a scene where Sheeta chuckles and her mouth doesn't move one bit."
"3321","tt0092067","4076","69","As far as things about the film itself, these are my thoughts."
"3322","tt0092067","4076","70","I thought the most amazing part of Laputa was the animation."
"3323","tt0092067","4076","71","From the opening sequence to the ending, the animation is so lush and detailed, you just have to watch in awe."
"3324","tt0092067","4076","72","You see the true nature of each character, true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action."
"3325","tt0092067","4076","73","You have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film."
"3326","tt0092067","4076","74","Everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn, it's like a moving piece of art."
"3327","tt0092067","4076","75","And to think, this was done in the mid 1980's."
"3328","tt0092067","4076","76","The animation is quite different from Disney, Ghibli has it's own distinctive flare which is very different, but very good."
"3329","tt0092067","4076","77","And after all these years, the colors look as vibrant as ever."
"3330","tt0092067","4076","78","Laputa also has tons of action sequences, lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground."
"3331","tt0092067","4076","79","These sequences are so well done and so intriguing, it's scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film."
"3332","tt0092067","4076","80","And the finale is just something you MUST see."
"3333","tt0092067","4076","81","The sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions, guns firing and everything else well."
"3334","tt0092067","4076","82","And like all Miyazaki films, each one focuses on a different theme i.g."
"3335","tt0092067","4076","83","Kiki: Confidence."
"3336","tt0092067","4076","84","This one has a great a lesson on greed and power."
"3337","tt0092067","4076","85","People don't realize how greed can take over you, and how having too much power isn't good."
"3338","tt0092067","4076","86","People are obsessed with power, and are greedy, and the main villian, Muska, greatly shows this."
"3339","tt0092067","4076","87","All in all, Laputa: Castle In The Sky was a great film to begin with, and is now improved for the most part."
"3340","tt0092067","4076","88","I am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it's glory."
"3341","tt0092067","4076","89","With a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from Joe Hisaishi, Disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy."
"3342","tt0092067","4076","90","Though I think the voices matched the mouths better in the Kiki and Princess Mononoke Disney dubs, Castle In The Sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film."
"3343","tt0092067","4077","1","I first saw this back in the early 90s on UK TV, i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it, many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it TV again, the main thing that stuck with me was the end, the hole castle part really touched me, its easy to watch, has a great story, great music, the list goes on and on, its OK me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it, yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch, it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty, i am so glad it has came out on DVD as it is one of my top 10 films of all time."
"3344","tt0092067","4077","2","Buy it or rent it just see it, best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you don't have to stop the film."
"3345","tt0092067","4077","3","Enjoy"
"3346","tt0092067","4078","1","This is one of my all time favorite movies, PERIOD."
"3347","tt0092067","4078","2","I can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does."
"3348","tt0092067","4078","3","This flick has it all: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs."
"3349","tt0092067","4078","4","Bad and even some Romance without even an innocent ""peck"" on the cheek between the Pazu and Sheeta."
"3350","tt0092067","4078","5","Maybe best of all, you don't have to be in Mensa to ""get it"" and enjoy the movie like you do with some of Miyazaki's other movies I don't know about you, but I watch movies to take a break from thinking."
"3351","tt0092067","4078","6","This is just a flat out enjoyable movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and go buy it."
"3352","tt0092067","4078","7","The only sour note is the American Dubbing."
"3353","tt0092067","4078","8","I found Vander Geek to be just plain annoying."
"3354","tt0092067","4078","9","But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the two disc set and it rocks!"
"3355","tt0092067","4078","10","Who cares if you can't understand spoken Japanese."
"3356","tt0092067","4078","11","If you can read at a second grade level then watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles."
"3357","tt0092067","4078","12","You won't regret it."
"3358","tt0092067","4079","1","I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK where it was called ""Laupta: The Flying Island""."
"3359","tt0092067","4079","2","I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it."
"3360","tt0092067","4079","3","I was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music."
"3361","tt0092067","4079","4","It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw sometimes erroneously referred to as the ""Streamline Dub"" the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box set."
"3362","tt0092067","4079","5","Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney."
"3363","tt0092067","4079","6","The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the ""streamline"" dub or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead."
"3364","tt0092067","4079","7","They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from ""Pazu"" to ""Patzu"", and added some dialogue."
"3365","tt0092067","4079","8","But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films."
"3366","tt0092067","4079","9","This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."
"3367","tt0092067","4079","10","The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass market, homogenized animation."
"3368","tt0092067","4080","1","This is one of the best animated family films of all time."
"3369","tt0092067","4080","2","Moreover, virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli."
"3370","tt0092067","4080","3","Specifically, other great films include ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Kikki's Delivery Service."""
"3371","tt0092067","4080","4","Spirited Away is quite good, but a bit too creepy for typical family fare better for teenagers and adult."
"3372","tt0092067","4080","5","The one thing that sets ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" apart from other films by Miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension filled adventure ride."
"3373","tt0092067","4080","6","Why is this film so good."
"3374","tt0092067","4080","7","Because it's a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the story is truly engaging and compelling."
"3375","tt0092067","4080","8","Most Japanese anime is imaginative, but decidedly dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized, and juvenile."
"3376","tt0092067","4080","9","None of these problems plague Castle in the Sky."
"3377","tt0092067","4080","10","It has imagination to burn, and the characters are well drawn, if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people."
"3378","tt0092067","4080","11","None of those trench coat wearing posers There is plenty of adventure, but not blood and gore."
"3379","tt0092067","4080","12","The animation is smooth, detailed, and cinematic ally composed not a lot of flat shots."
"3380","tt0092067","4080","13","The backgrounds are wonderful."
"3381","tt0092067","4080","14","The voice acting in the dubbed English version is first rate, particularly the two leads, Pazo James Van der Beek and Sheeta Anna Paquin."
"3382","tt0092067","4080","15","The sound engineering is great, too."
"3383","tt0092067","4080","16","Use your studio sound, if you've got it."
"3384","tt0092067","4080","17","One aspect that I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained."
"3385","tt0092067","4080","18","Laputa was once inhabited, and is now abandoned."
"3386","tt0092067","4080","19","Why."
"3387","tt0092067","4080","20","We never know."
"3388","tt0092067","4080","21","We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized."
"3389","tt0092067","4080","22","Indeed, it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters, who are for the most part one dimensional stock characters e.g., gruff general, silly sidekick, kooky old miner, etc."
"3390","tt0092067","4080","23","Highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60!"
"3391","tt0092067","4081","1","I have seen just about all of Miyazaki's films, and they are all beautiful and captivating."
"3392","tt0092067","4081","2","But this one rises above the rest."
"3393","tt0092067","4081","3","This movie totally impressed me!"
"3394","tt0092067","4081","4","I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and their sweet, caring friendship."
"3395","tt0092067","4081","5","They were what made the movie for me."
"3396","tt0092067","4081","6","Of course, the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly."
"3397","tt0092067","4081","7","But the characters are the shining point in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality."
"3398","tt0092067","4081","8","Now, let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie with English subs."
"3399","tt0092067","4081","9","While the English dub is good mostly, it simply pales in comparison to the original language version."
"3400","tt0092067","4081","10","The voices are better, the dialogue, everything."
"3401","tt0092067","4081","11","So I suggest seeing and hearing the movie the way it originally was."
"3402","tt0092067","4082","1","Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney."
"3403","tt0092067","4082","2","That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist."
"3404","tt0092067","4082","3","He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride."
"3405","tt0092067","4082","4","But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking!"
"3406","tt0092067","4082","5","Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me."
"3407","tt0092067","4082","6","Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination."
"3408","tt0092067","4082","7","Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like."
"3409","tt0092067","4082","8","The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true."
"3410","tt0092067","4082","9","Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself."
"3411","tt0092067","4082","10","Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!"
"3412","tt0092067","4082","11","Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here."
"3413","tt0101811","427","1","one of the best ensemble acted films I've ever seen."
"3414","tt0101811","427","2","There isn't much to the plot, but the acting incredible."
"3415","tt0101811","427","3","You see the characters change ever so subtly, undr the influence of the rented villa in Italy, and love."
"3416","tt0101811","427","4","And happiness."
"3417","tt0101811","427","5","The film casts a mesmerizing spell on you, much as the villa does on all the women."
"3418","tt0101811","427","6","Truly ""enchanted""."
"3419","tt0101811","428","1","Two women, sick of their controlling husbands, taking a vacation in Italy for a month with two other very different women."
"3420","tt0101811","428","2","They come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film by Merchant Ivory."
"3421","tt0101811","428","3","Great scenery and the location isn't bad either."
"3422","tt0101811","428","4","Seriously, a very good period piece 7 of 10"
"3423","tt0101811","429","1","It has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism."
"3424","tt0101811","429","2","The only two movies I can think of is ""Enchanted April"" 1992 and ""The Enchanted Cottage"" 1945."
"3425","tt0101811","429","3","Both movies used wonderful actors not stars."
"3426","tt0101811","429","4","In both movies, all the actors gave their best romantic performances."""
"3427","tt0101811","429","5","Enchanted April"" is about four English women after WWI who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy while on vacation."
"3428","tt0101811","429","6","It is amazing ""Enchanted April"" was made in 1992."
"3429","tt0101811","429","7","It stands out as an enjoyable classic."
"3430","tt0101811","430","1","This was a very good film."
"3431","tt0101811","430","2","I didn't go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting, the script, and the scenery."
"3432","tt0101811","430","3","Miranda Richardson was fantastic and so was Joan Plowright."
"3433","tt0101811","430","4","They stole the show."
"3434","tt0101811","430","5","But the other actors played their parts wonderfully also."
"3435","tt0101811","430","6","Very enjoyable film."
"3436","tt0101811","431","1","It starts slowly, showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but don't give up on it."
"3437","tt0101811","431","2","Nothing much happens, but the time passes exquisitely, and there are numerous sly jokes my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm, which I find hilarious."
"3438","tt0101811","431","3","The movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word, the scenery is beautiful as is Polly Walker, and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying."
"3439","tt0101811","431","4","The movie takes a couple of liberties with the book, the biggest being with the Arbuthnot/Briggs/Dester business, but I actually preferred the movie's version of this it may be more sentimental, but I felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and anyway I like sentiment when it's well done."
"3440","tt0101811","431","5","An excellent movie, especially as a date movie during lousy weather."
"3441","tt0101811","432","1","I only watched this because it starred Josie Lawrence, who I knewfrom Whose Line is it Anyway., the wacky British improvisationalcomedy show."
"3442","tt0101811","432","2","I was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem."
"3443","tt0101811","432","3","It is uplifting, touching, andromantic without being sappy or sentimental."
"3444","tt0101811","432","4","The characters areall real people, with real foibles, fears and needs."
"3445","tt0101811","432","5","See it.!"
"3446","tt0101811","433","1","This is one of those rare movies, it's lovely and compelling, dignified and quirky, a true gift."
"3447","tt0101811","433","2","I consider it a prerequisite for any trip to Italy, or any vacation at all, because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience yup, find the magic."
"3448","tt0101811","433","3","I especially loved Josie Lawrence, as Lottie Wilkins, but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film."
"3449","tt0101811","433","4","Further the costumes, if you're drawn to fashion and costumes, are extraordinarily well done."
"3450","tt0101811","433","5","I just wish they'd release it on DVD because I'm wearing my tape version out!"
"3451","tt0101811","433","6","Absolutely well worth your time, just make sure to settle in to watch it, without any interruptions."
"3452","tt0101811","434","1","Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu."
"3453","tt0101811","434","2","Being a male, I'm probably not qualified to totally understand it, but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start."
"3454","tt0101811","434","3","It isn't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher."
"3455","tt0101811","434","4","What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters."
"3456","tt0101811","434","5","Each has their own ""thing"" that they contend with."
"3457","tt0101811","434","6","Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion."
"3458","tt0101811","434","7","What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have."
"3459","tt0101811","434","8","It didn't try to pound a lesson into us."
"3460","tt0101811","434","9","The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light."
"3461","tt0101811","434","10","I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen."
"3462","tt0101811","434","11","Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people."
"3463","tt0101811","435","1","Two thirds of nearly 2,000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8, 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes Was this a record, or merely a faulty VCR.."
"3464","tt0101811","435","2","Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination."
"3465","tt0101811","435","3","But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it."
"3466","tt0101811","435","4","My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book."
"3467","tt0101811","435","5","My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form."
"3468","tt0101811","435","6","Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things, but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing, although in no way syrupy, and was also very well written."
"3469","tt0101811","435","7","I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film, and so decided to buy her the videotape."
"3470","tt0101811","435","8","I am now very glad that I did, and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre Mussolini Italian atmosphere."
"3471","tt0101811","435","9","The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together, away from their families, in a rented villa in Italy."
"3472","tt0101811","435","10","Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds."
"3473","tt0101811","435","11","Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses, not only between these four very disparate mature ladies, but also with the occasional male visitor."
"3474","tt0101811","435","12","If you want action, thrills, dramatic sex scenes, natural or man made disasters, or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you."
"3475","tt0101811","435","13","But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch, and if you care to give it a try you may, as I did, come to rank it among your much loved films."
"3476","tt0101811","435","14","It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar."
"3477","tt0101811","435","15","In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film, but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book, effectively unrolled before my eyes."
"3478","tt0101811","435","16","Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this, the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio's Decameron on TV."
"3479","tt0101811","435","17","Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal, but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events."
"3480","tt0101811","435","18","This works very well, although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story."
"3481","tt0101811","435","19","Great credit is due to the Director, Mike Newell, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies."
"3482","tt0101811","436","1","I absolutely loved this movie."
"3483","tt0101811","436","2","I am not even sure what particularly about it but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVD."
"3484","tt0101811","436","3","The women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the Villa in Italy."
"3485","tt0101811","436","4","The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job."
"3486","tt0101811","436","5","The characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work."
"3487","tt0101811","436","6","There is humor, drama and relationship issues all in good time."
"3488","tt0101811","436","7","This requires 10 lines but I just can't think of any more to say so I will just rattle on until I get 10 lines."
"3489","tt0101811","436","8","So sorry about this."
"3490","tt0101811","436","9","What else can I possibly say it has been a long time since I last saw it."
"3491","tt0101811","436","10","I am looking forward to view again but it isn't available."
"3492","tt0101811","437","1","Enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words."
"3493","tt0101811","437","2","It has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out."
"3494","tt0101811","437","3","I continue to wait, albeit less patiently, for the film to come out in DVD format."
"3495","tt0101811","437","4","Apparently, I am not alone."
"3496","tt0101811","437","5","If parent company Amazon's listings are correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format."
"3497","tt0101811","437","6","Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script."
"3498","tt0101811","437","7","Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries."
"3499","tt0101811","437","8","The cast is spectacular, the cinematography and direction impeccable."
"3500","tt0101811","437","9","The film is a definite keeper."
"3501","tt0101811","437","10","Many have already asked."

"3503","tt0101811","438","1","From rainy, dreary late winter England of early 1920s... where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams known now as World War I..."
"3504","tt0101811","438","2","Four women share this lovely small sunny Italian castle on a hill; one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying, two women who will rediscover their own husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends......"

"3507","tt0101811","438","5","Study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story."
"3508","tt0101811","438","6","Probably not a film to please many men..."
"3509","tt0101811","438","7","NOTE: Stock up on coffee & hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day..."
"3510","tt0101811","438","8","Spring is coming..."
"3511","tt0101811","438","9","Enchanted April promises you!"
"3512","tt0101811","439","1","The true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way note that this change need not be positive or beneficial at the end."
"3513","tt0101811","439","2","By that measure, Enchanted April is a resounding success."
"3514","tt0101811","439","3","As a film in general, it succeeds quite well excellent ensemble cast, well developed characters you come to care about, wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations."
"3515","tt0101811","439","4","In short the film is, well, enchanting."
"3516","tt0101811","439","5","Although all the performances are first rate, three must be mentioned Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright."
"3517","tt0101811","439","6","It says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast."
"3518","tt0101811","439","7","Most highly recommended, particularly if you are a romantic at heart."
"3519","tt0101811","439","8","Further Deponent Saith Not."
"3520","tt0101811","440","1","My all time favorite movie."
"3521","tt0101811","440","2","Oscar caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera."
"3522","tt0101811","440","3","The screenplay is perfect, and works out the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfying way, unlike the novel."
"3523","tt0101811","440","4","The care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won Oscars for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment."
"3524","tt0101811","440","5","It is Josie Lawrence's best work by far, and transformed my opinion of Joan Plowright."
"3525","tt0101811","440","6","Having watched this movie at least 50 times, I can find no fault in it."
"3526","tt0101811","440","7","The music, by famed composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a marvel."
"3527","tt0101811","441","1","This is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life."
"3528","tt0101811","441","2","The pacing, the camera work, the emotion, the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see."
"3529","tt0101811","441","3","It isn't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted."
"3530","tt0101811","441","4","The only flaw I can see about this film is that it wasn't captured in a more technically perfect film format."
"3531","tt0101811","441","5","It deserved Todd AO, Technicolor and the very finest sound format available."
"3532","tt0101811","441","6","An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter."
"3533","tt0101811","441","7","The gorgeous Italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard."
"3534","tt0101811","441","8","As it is, it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film."
"3535","tt0101811","441","9","I can't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite."
"3536","tt0101811","441","10","The transformations of the characters from contained, tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and I really should recommend it more often."
"3537","tt0101811","441","11","The casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, the acting is above reproach."
"3538","tt0101811","441","12","It is a film about middle age and the choices people make."
"3539","tt0101811","441","13","It is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness."
"3540","tt0101811","441","14","Watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you."
"3541","tt0101811","441","15","If you don't get it, perhaps you haven't lived enough, or something else is wrong with you."
"3542","tt0101811","442","1","This is what I call a growth movie."
"3543","tt0101811","442","2","Every character is different and better at the end and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a ""tub of love""."
"3544","tt0101811","442","3","Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes."
"3545","tt0101811","442","4","Even the men in this film go from being self centered to better men."
"3546","tt0101811","442","5","The book stayed very true to the novel, which is a plus in my book, since I am a librarian."
"3547","tt0101811","442","6","The scenery breath taking and the message of love genuine."
"3548","tt0101811","443","1","I first saw this movie back in the early '90's when it was first released."
"3549","tt0101811","443","2","Room With a View was also newly out."
"3550","tt0101811","443","3","Enchanted April had so much more to offer!"
"3551","tt0101811","443","4","I found it much more real and earthy, the characters more believable for being 'normal'."
"3552","tt0101811","443","5","By the end of the film I felt the same as I did when I first saw the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, I was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation, peace, liberty or love."
"3553","tt0101811","443","6","You get a sense throughout that Italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known, that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting."
"3554","tt0101811","443","7","But in the heat of the spring in April, everyone's lives loosen and unravel in line with the Victorian corsets and are slowly rebuilt to everyone's satisfaction."
"3555","tt0101811","443","8","What a little gem of a film!"
"3556","tt0101811","443","9","How come it isn't more well known."
"3557","tt0101811","444","1","This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a compliment."
"3558","tt0101811","444","2","Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E."
"3559","tt0101811","444","3","M."
"3560","tt0101811","444","4","Forster novels, this very Merchant Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992."
"3561","tt0101811","444","5","It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME."
"3562","tt0101811","444","6","Here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with self discovery."

"3564","tt0101811","444","8","Fisher Joan Plowright."
"3565","tt0101811","444","9","This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming, dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be."
"3566","tt0101811","444","10","Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent then relatively new to American audiences fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a living thing of near magical elements, full of quiet moments and wonder."

"3572","tt0101811","445","6","It' pure and simple, with no car chases, no animosities and no deaths."
"3573","tt0101811","445","7","It was made with care and in very good taste."
"3574","tt0101811","445","8","You cannot help but smile all through it except when you're crying happy tears!"

"3612","tt0101811","450","2","Unfortunately the movie was rather short, unusually so for a period piece, and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect."

"3623","tt0101811","451","1","If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England."

"3626","tt0101811","451","4","Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century, this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too."

"3642","tt0101811","453","4","This movie is very low key."
"3643","tt0101811","453","5","Seeing ""Enchanted April"" is a very healing experience."
"3644","tt0101811","453","6","The sound track and gorgeous scenery, along with the ladies' gentle manners, bring to mind the peace and beauty of a pre Raphaelite painting."
"3645","tt0101811","453","7","Lest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie, I will paraphrase a line I heard once on ""Saturday Night Live"" and say that my two favorite movies are ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Enchanted April""."

"3690","tt0102388","2302","4","I actually gained some respect for Reese to know who she was so early on."
"3691","tt0102388","2302","5","I say that because whenever I have watched her perform, the characters thus far, in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character, quite nicely in fact."
"3692","tt0102388","2302","6","Anyway, my first film experience with Reese was the Little Red Riding Hood parody Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland, somehow I assumed that was her first time up ""at bat"" Not so, well done Reese"

"3696","tt0102388","2303","4","Witherspoon already begins to show the Oscar winning talent she would develop in this early role and London makes a charming leading man."
"3697","tt0102388","2303","5","Warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well."
"3698","tt0102388","2303","6","Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the girls' parents and Gail Strickland, who plays London's mom."
"3699","tt0102388","2303","7","I was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase ""family ties."""
"3700","tt0102388","2304","1","I thought this movie was very well done."
"3701","tt0102388","2304","2","Taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked accurate to me."
"3702","tt0102388","2304","3","It was well cast and believable."
"3703","tt0102388","2304","4","I don't usually care much for this type of movie, because they just don't have any depth, but I felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt, you got to really know them and care about them."

"3710","tt0102388","2305","1","I thought this was a very good movie."
"3711","tt0102388","2305","2","It would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off."
"3712","tt0102388","2305","3","I'm sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending, that's why this made this move such a good movie."
"3713","tt0102388","2305","4","It shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings that you can always get thru it and that if it's 2 sisters dealing with a boy, the same boy that working thru the pain and hurt makes things to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them."
"3714","tt0102388","2305","5","It's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still get thru it become even closer after its over."

"3717","tt0102388","2305","8","It would have been nice if there would have been a part 2 for this movie, maybe having the older sister to come up and have his baby, this would really have made a great finish to the story since he died, this way it would keep him alive even though he's dead."

"3723","tt0102388","2306","6","The Man in the Moon is superbly made, a gentle hearted, joyous and tragic film, beautifully filmed, one in which the actors truly live in the moment rather than act."
"3724","tt0102388","2306","7","This sweet tale shortly will be in our private library."
"3725","tt0102388","2306","8","This beautiful story of life in a far finer era in rural Louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral setting."
"3726","tt0102388","2306","9","It's hard to remain stoic during the film's last moments, particularly when the young girl the extent of her older sister's heart searing private pain and forgives all."
"3727","tt0102388","2306","10","Rather than spoil the enjoyment or bore you to sobs with my dull prose, will end now with this suggestion from one who enjoys films which speak from the heart to ours."

"3732","tt0102388","2306","15","Paul Vincent ZecchinoManasota Key, Florida05 April, 2009"
"3733","tt0102388","2307","1","i must say this movie is truly amazing and heartwarming."
"3734","tt0102388","2307","2","Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London's not so bad either!"
"3735","tt0102388","2307","3","it is so sweet watching Dani fall in love and it breaks my heart and yet warms my heart at the same time watching Court fall in love with Maureen. however it is even sweeter watching how much he cares for Dani."
"3736","tt0102388","2307","4","I must admit though i did kind of want him to fall for Dani in the end. it is just so cute watching her fall for him i did not want her to get her heart broken so badly. but the biggest tragedy i have ever seen occurred in this movie. watching him die made me cry for a whole day. i just could not believe it. however never a more loving relationship has been shown in a movie then Maureen and Dani. they really can make it through anything. i am giving this movie a 9 because i didn't want Court to die but it was still one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen."
"3737","tt0102388","2308","1","I checked this out as an impulse when browsing through the movie store and couldn't have been any more pleasantly surprised!"
"3738","tt0102388","2308","2","My mom and I watched this film together, and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
"3739","tt0102388","2308","3","It isn't the typical ""chick flick"" with a sappy love story and tears all the way through, but it definitely touches a nerve in the twist at the end."
"3740","tt0102388","2308","4","It's an ending where, although unexpected and tragic, the movie's overall effect is not harmed by it."
"3741","tt0102388","2308","5","I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress even in this film, her debut, and this is definitely worth watching!"
"3742","tt0102388","2308","6","I didn't recognize many of the supporting actors, but they all play their important supporting roles well."
"3743","tt0102388","2308","7","""The Man in the Moon"" is such an believable story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time."
"3744","tt0102388","2308","8","Most women can definitely relate to everything from Witherspoon's words, her subtle glances, and her not so subtle emotions raging like the typical teenage girl."
"3745","tt0102388","2308","9","While she's playing a character confused about love, she does not come across as silly and immature, which was much appreciated considering many movies today."
"3746","tt0102388","2309","1","It was life changing, IT REALLY WAS!!!"
"3747","tt0102388","2309","2","The Man In The Moon is a breathtaking experience to watch."
"3748","tt0102388","2309","3","The acting was fabulous, the story line was great, and this was a perfect start for Reese Witherspoon's career."
"3749","tt0102388","2309","4","I don't see how anyone couldn't love this film."
"3750","tt0102388","2309","5","Sure, it's not the best movie ever, even though it was close to it, but it was highly amusing to watch, and I even had a big laugh at one of the jokes, and a lot of other little laughs."
"3751","tt0102388","2309","6","Of course, there was some cry your heart out moments too, but this movie was enlightening, and it brightens up your day, although you have to get a little depressed from the story every now and then."
"3752","tt0102388","2309","7","I can't believe this movie didn't win at least one award, and I also can't believe that it's been seen by so little people on this site."
"3753","tt0102388","2309","8","See this movie if you haven't for it is definitely touching."
"3754","tt0102388","2310","1","I was so surprised by how great The Man In The Moon truly was."
"3755","tt0102388","2310","2","I mean at first I was kinda expecting a cheesy, and predictable film, but I decided to put that aside when watching."
"3756","tt0102388","2310","3","Well, when it was over I was just left stunnedmainly in tears, by how great The Man In The Moon turned out to be."
"3757","tt0102388","2310","4","This movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone, and its just a fabulous film."
"3758","tt0102388","2310","5","The acting was great especially from Reece Witherspoonwho was so cute and lovable, and everyone else."
"3759","tt0102388","2310","6","There wasn't anything that really bothered me, I felt the ending kinda predictable, but very well done at that."
"3760","tt0102388","2310","7","Also I felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before, but still a great film."
"3761","tt0102388","2310","8","Overall I must say I don't to much to say about this film, not that it was bad, its just a film you either like or don't like."
"3762","tt0102388","2310","9","I would however recommend this to any and everyone, even if you don't like these type of films, its still an enjoyable film.8.7 out of 10 stars"
"3763","tt0102388","2311","1","Reese Witherspooon's first movie."
"3764","tt0102388","2311","2","Loved it."
"3765","tt0102388","2311","3","The plot and the acting was top notch."
"3766","tt0102388","2311","4","You are emotionally involved with the characters."
"3767","tt0102388","2311","5","In my opinion, a must see."
"3768","tt0102388","2311","6","After watching this movie you will see why Reese Witherspoon's acting career has been so successful."
"3769","tt0102388","2311","7","The other cast members do a great job also."
"3770","tt0102388","2311","8","The movie flows extremely well."
"3771","tt0102388","2311","9","There is not a boring moment in the whole picture."
"3772","tt0102388","2311","10","The Man in the Moon's length is just right."
"3773","tt0102388","2311","11","As I said earlier, I think this movie was excellent."
"3774","tt0102388","2311","12","I have seen it numerous times, and have enjoyed every one of the viewings."
"3775","tt0102388","2312","1","A young man named Court is loved by everyone."
"3776","tt0102388","2312","2","His painful bloody death brings everyone closer."
"3777","tt0102388","2312","3","You can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie."
"3778","tt0102388","2312","4","Whether predictable or not, and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs, this is a moving story, full of milieu and sensuality."
"3779","tt0102388","2312","5","One other thing, someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didn't seem plausible."
"3780","tt0102388","2312","6","But the elements for this are set up subtly."
"3781","tt0102388","2312","7","Note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field."
"3782","tt0102388","2312","8","Note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves."
"3783","tt0102388","2312","9","He is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment."
"3784","tt0102388","2312","10","To this day, tractors are pretty dangerous."
"3785","tt0102388","2313","1","This ""coming of age"" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love one fateful summer."
"3786","tt0102388","2313","2","Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his superb work in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" the film never hits a false note."
"3787","tt0102388","2313","3","All the acting is superb."
"3788","tt0102388","2313","4","As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a stunning film debut."
"3789","tt0102388","2313","5","Watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film, I felt like I was looking through a window to reality, rather than watching a movie."
"3790","tt0102388","2313","6","I have watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the single best movies ever made about being young, being in love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood."
"3791","tt0102388","2313","7","Families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together, and use it as a discussion piece, as it raises a number of issues about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc."
"3792","tt0102388","2314","1","I had heard good things about this film and was, you guessed it, a bit disappointed."
"3793","tt0102388","2314","2","Reese Witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, at a young age; really all the small cast are quite solid, in their simple 50s American setting."
"3794","tt0102388","2314","3","The reason I didn't rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end, the grief shown by the older sister didn't seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit."
"3795","tt0102388","2314","4","Perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot, or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer."
"3796","tt0102388","2314","5","Maureen's character is quite underdeveloped I think."
"3797","tt0102388","2314","6","It is understandable that Dani Reese W., the younger would be traumatised and angry, but why is her sister shown to be more upset."
"3798","tt0102388","2314","7","Because she's a few years older."
"3799","tt0102388","2314","8","Hasn't the end rather undermined the rest of the film."
"3800","tt0102388","2314","9","The pacing of the movie makes it seem that Maureen and Court have only just met, when he gets tractored warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit. well it works!."
"3801","tt0102388","2314","10","It depends what you want if you want the girls' happy story of young love that it seems like you're going to get, you're in for a surprise."
"3802","tt0102388","2314","11","Man in the Moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination."
"3803","tt0102388","2314","12","I liked the character of Court though, I can see what girls watching this might be watching."
"3804","tt0102388","2314","13","And I loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would, most films wouldn't and get killed.7/10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale."
"3805","tt0102388","2314","14","For some reason I found Jason London on a tractor funny."
"3806","tt0102388","2315","1","There is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise."
"3807","tt0102388","2315","2","Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by Reese Witherspoon."
"3808","tt0102388","2315","3","That her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed."
"3809","tt0102388","2315","4","Robert Mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work."
"3810","tt0102388","2315","5","Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its best."
"3811","tt0102388","2316","1","I watched this movie by chance, get curious by the trailer on TV."
"3812","tt0102388","2316","2","I like when I discover movies like this, little, tender stories about ordinary people."
"3813","tt0102388","2316","3","Even if the end is tragic, ""The Man in the Moon"" has some funny moments, especially in the first characterization of Dani, with her innocent and pure love affair with Court."
"3814","tt0102388","2316","4","It's really a beautiful, moving love story with 3 high points: the performance of Reese Witherspoon, who maintained her promises in the world of cinema, the beautiful cinematography by the ""Old Lion"" Freddie Francis and the fantastic score by James Newton Howard, which is really the soul of the movie."
"3815","tt0102388","2316","5","His themes which deserved an Oscar nomination are so intimate and lyric that it seems they had transformed the screenplay in music."
"3816","tt0102388","2317","1","Loved the film!"
"3817","tt0102388","2317","2","This was my first glimpse at both Reese Witherspoon and Jason London, both of which are two of my favorites."
"3818","tt0102388","2317","3","Must say that no matter how many times I've seen this movie I can't help but tear up."
"3819","tt0102388","2317","4","One of those movies that should become a classic for all."
"3820","tt0102388","2318","1","I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14 year old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957."
"3821","tt0102388","2318","2","She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen a now rarely seen Emily Warfield, and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing."
"3822","tt0102388","2318","3","Then seventeen year old Court Foster Jason London, the son of her mother's close friend Gail Strickland moves in next door, Dani experiences her first crush, while Court enjoys her company, and willful spirit."
"3823","tt0102388","2318","4","Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving Dani behind."
"3824","tt0102388","2318","5","The sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts, which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident."
"3825","tt0102388","2318","6","The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other."
"3826","tt0102388","2318","7","Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents, trying to balance their daughters' individuality, at the same time trying to keep the family together."
"3827","tt0102388","2318","8","The beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time."
"3828","tt0102388","2318","9","A touching coming of age film with a timeless message."
"3829","tt0102388","2319","1","It's a generic coming of age story think ""The Member of the Wedding,"" ""Summer of '42,"" ""A Summer Place,"" even ""Little Women"" and there are moments where Mulligan might have omitted the soupy music, not used slow motion, or played down the golden lit prettiness of the setting."
"3830","tt0102388","2319","2","Otherwise, it's done with rare emotional perfect pitch."
"3831","tt0102388","2319","3","Nothing's forced, every line has feeling, and the pacing is just right."
"3832","tt0102388","2319","4","Even the below A list casting helps: Bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material."
"3833","tt0102388","2319","5","In particular, Witherspoon is excellent: Her line readings are fresh and original, and her body language is just right for a gawky, hoydenish 14 year old on the eve of womanhood."
"3834","tt0102388","2319","6","Waterston is also very fine, even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck."
"3835","tt0102388","2319","7","One senses that the film's makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects no big stars, no big car crashes, no special effects and consciously decided to make the best possible movie, box office be damned."
"3836","tt0102388","2319","8","It's intimate and honest, and it sticks to the ribs."
"3837","tt0102388","2319","9","If you find yourself misting up at the end, you don't have to feel you've been duped."
"3838","tt0102388","2320","1","Not only is this movie a great film for basic cinematography screenplay, acting, setting, etc. but also for it's realism."
"3839","tt0102388","2320","2","This movie could take place in any farm or rural setting."
"3840","tt0102388","2320","3","It makes no difference if the movie takes place in Louisiana or if it would take place in Kansas."
"3841","tt0102388","2320","4","The story and the messages it includes would remain the same."
"3842","tt0102388","2320","5","This movie shows family values and connections for an older audience, while at the same time it shows youthful behavior for the younger viewers."
"3843","tt0102388","2320","6","Everyone who watches this will walk away with something having touched them personally, I know I did."
"3844","tt0102388","2320","7","The ending hits way too close to home for me not to burst into tears every time I watch it."
"3845","tt0102388","2320","8","The ending stresses the importance of farm safety, and everyone who has ever worked on a farm needs to see this film."
"3846","tt0102388","2320","9","Not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations."
"3847","tt0102388","2321","1","Here's the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching."
"3848","tt0102388","2321","2","And mostly, it's for two reasons."
"3849","tt0102388","2321","3","One, it concentrates of young people, VERY young people."
"3850","tt0102388","2321","4","People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are."
"3851","tt0102388","2321","5","All of us have been there in our lives and ""The Man in the Moon"" is a magnificent reflection upon our memories, maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced."
"3852","tt0102388","2321","6","The second reason is that is a love triangle."
"3853","tt0102388","2321","7","And I do believe that as teens, it's the most dramatic."
"3854","tt0102388","2321","8","And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love, or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs, will believe it for the rest of their lives."
"3855","tt0102388","2321","9","The cast of ""The Man in the Moon"" is full of great talented names."
"3856","tt0102388","2321","10","It stars Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict, yet caring and wise fathers as in this film."
"3857","tt0102388","2321","11","Also there is Tess Harper, Jason London, and a young, young Reese Witherspoon."
"3858","tt0102388","2321","12","You look at the young, talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road, she's going to win the Academy Award."
"3859","tt0102388","2321","13","All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay, they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations."
"3860","tt0102388","2321","14","As if it all really happened."
"3861","tt0102388","2321","15","This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often."
"3862","tt0102388","2321","16","Love story or not."
"3863","tt0102388","2321","17","I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way."
"3864","tt0102388","2322","1","That magical moment in life, that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood, and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood . . . this is what this movie is all about."
"3865","tt0102388","2322","2","Danni wonderfully played by Reese Witherspoon is right at that moment in life when the movie starts."
"3866","tt0102388","2322","3","She swoons over Elvis, playing his records and wishfully thinking about love."
"3867","tt0102388","2322","4","Maureen her sister will soon be off to college, has no trouble with attracting boys, is beautiful, and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn't."
"3868","tt0102388","2322","5","She dates a local loser whos father is also after her, and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet."
"3869","tt0102388","2322","6","Danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn't good enough."
"3870","tt0102388","2322","7","She wants to be Maureen but doesn't see that she is beautiful herself."
"3871","tt0102388","2322","8","The moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets Court Foster for the first time."
"3872","tt0102388","2322","9","Court whos father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers."
"3873","tt0102388","2322","10","He has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun."
"3874","tt0102388","2322","11","On one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find Danni skinny dipping."
"3875","tt0102388","2322","12","They yell and argue and Danni leaves."

"3883","tt0102388","2322","20","One look between the two and its all over."
"3884","tt0102388","2322","21","The looks of pain and defeat on Danni's face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time."
"3885","tt0102388","2322","22","The rest of the movie I will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sisters."
"3886","tt0102388","2322","23","The greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love, and the pain they must endure both together and individually."
"3887","tt0102388","2322","24","Danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair, painful, and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started."
"3888","tt0102388","2322","25","Few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly."

"3919","tt0102388","2326","3","This was truly a heartbreaking story about first love."

"3924","tt0102388","2327","2","That is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic coming of age film from Director Robert Mulligan."
"3925","tt0102388","2327","3","Mulligan is famous for previously directing Summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the coming of age genre."

"3930","tt0102388","2327","8","Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist."
"3931","tt0102388","2327","9","The music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive."
"3932","tt0102388","2327","10","The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director Freddie Francis, who was in his 70's when this was shot."

"3938","tt0102388","2328","1","Perfect movies are rare."
"3939","tt0102388","2328","2","Even my favorite films tend to have flaws Rear Window looks a little stagey at times, Chris Elliot's character in Groundhog Day doesn't work, the music score in Best Years of Our Lives is too cheesy, the beginning of Nights of Cabiria is a little too slow but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish."
"3940","tt0102388","2328","3","The script is brilliant, the acting is superb all around although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines, the directing and the photography are inspired, and the music score is touching without being intrusive like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative."
"3941","tt0102388","2328","4","Every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile."
"3942","tt0102388","2328","5","This truly is one of the best films I have ever seen and I wish there were more films like it."
"3943","tt0102388","2328","6","I am glad that Reese Witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film, but I am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems."
"3944","tt0102388","2328","7","Brilliant!"

"3986","tt0102951","1133","11","Just a great movie if you're in the mood to go along for the ride and LAUGH!"
"3987","tt0102951","1134","1","The only part lacking in this movie is Shue's part as the daughter wanting to follow in her ""aunt's"" footsteps as a daytime soap star."
"3988","tt0102951","1134","2","Otherwise it would be a perfect 10."
"3989","tt0102951","1134","3","It seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script I have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing wasn't taking place in parts."
"3990","tt0102951","1134","4","It was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with you."
"3991","tt0102951","1134","5","It's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once."
"3992","tt0102951","1134","6","I'd recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose."
"3993","tt0102951","1134","7","You'll definitely want to watch the last scene closely, 'Nurse Nan' has a little secret she'd rather not have shared with you."
"3994","tt0102951","1134","8","If you love daytime soaps or despise them, this move pokes fun in all the right places."
"3995","tt0102951","1135","1","I first saw this in the movie theater when it came out, and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun."
"3996","tt0102951","1135","2","This is a great cast of characters, many big names in it, a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now."
"3997","tt0102951","1135","3","I think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors, or have loved them in other movies, to add it to your watched list."
"3998","tt0102951","1135","4","Some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well done comedy as in The Birdcage or even The Clue, kind of odd spontaneous appearing comedy, with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors."
"3999","tt0102951","1135","5","The movie did a great job at giving you some insight, perhaps even very realistic, into the culture of a daytime soap."
"4000","tt0102951","1136","1","I'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler, but I'm playing it safe, so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie."
"4001","tt0102951","1136","2","I adore this movie, and so does everyone I work with and that is the point."
"4002","tt0102951","1136","3","I spent a large part of my working life in cinema, without being an actor."
"4003","tt0102951","1136","4","Such people are the _sung_ heroes of this movie: the gaffers, the pullers, the on air directors, the lighters and writers, the costume people etc etc, and the whole thing is told from their point of view, at least to a great extent."
"4004","tt0102951","1136","5","Most actors are nuts and self absorbed to the point of absurdity, which is what this movie spoofs so well, but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real life drama!"
"4005","tt0102951","1136","6","Possible spoiler alert: in one great scene, the two leads, both actors, are _discussing_ how to _discuss_ something personal, something entirely 'out of script', with another actor, and they start making up lines, rehearsing them, and critiquing each other's performance."
"4006","tt0102951","1136","7","Since this movie appeared in, what was it, '91, it has become fashionable to do this, especially on TV."
"4007","tt0102951","1136","8","But hardly anyone has done it so well."
"4008","tt0102951","1137","1","It's very very funny."
"4009","tt0102951","1137","2","You know, just like a comedy is supposed to be."
"4010","tt0102951","1137","3","It also looks very very good, like a Hollywood Spectacular should."
"4011","tt0102951","1137","4","So, what more do you want."
"4012","tt0102951","1137","5","Howz about a very VERY good Sally Fields."
"4013","tt0102951","1137","6","She is so much better here than in anything else I've ever seen her in, and she looks so damn good."
"4014","tt0102951","1137","7","This movie is all you need to understand why she's a Star."
"4015","tt0102951","1137","8","Those eyes!"
"4016","tt0102951","1137","9","Like a silent movie star, but better."
"4017","tt0102951","1137","10","In fact, everyone's eyes are so good."
"4018","tt0102951","1137","11","I used to pretend to be a bad TV soap actor with my girlfriend."
"4019","tt0102951","1137","12","We'd do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner."
"4020","tt0102951","1137","13","They don't do that at all in Soap Dish."
"4021","tt0102951","1137","14","Great."
"4022","tt0102951","1137","15","The Eyes Have It!"
"4023","tt0102951","1137","16","sorry There's so many terrific performances, its fun just waiting for each of them to reappear."
"4024","tt0102951","1137","17","There's a whole workshop going on with Kevin Kline on how to Overact very very subtly."
"4025","tt0102951","1137","18","Got that."
"4026","tt0102951","1137","19","Yeah, he's damn good."
"4027","tt0102951","1137","20","So is Robert Downey, Jr. who has since made sumthin of a career of playing the Slick, Slimy Executive."
"4028","tt0102951","1137","21","Cathy Moriarity, while not the most gifted actress, is so charismatic and riveting, especially when she's angry."
"4029","tt0102951","1137","22","And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, her natural timing giving here somewhat flat delivery a little Zing."
"4030","tt0102951","1137","23","OK, no Whoopi Bashing, I hear ya."
"4031","tt0102951","1137","24","And then, there's the Hair."
"4032","tt0102951","1137","25","Soap Dish was made at the end of the BIG Hair Eighties, so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in themselves."
"4033","tt0102951","1137","26","They get bigger and sillier, just like your's did."
"4034","tt0102951","1137","27","Yeah, we got pictures."
"4035","tt0102951","1137","28","Soap Dish is better than I thought it'd be, better that I wanted it to be."
"4036","tt0102951","1137","29","I'm sick of Movies that tell me I'm supposed to care about shallow, self centered, semi talented egomaniacs, ie."
"4037","tt0102951","1137","30","TV Soap Actors."
"4038","tt0102951","1137","31","Soap Dish seems happy just to have me laugh at 'em."
"4039","tt0102951","1137","32","Thank You."
"4040","tt0102951","1138","1","When I was a kid of 8, I always watched movies and television that i wasn't supposed to, and this was one of them."
"4041","tt0102951","1138","2","It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and it has to be the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life, the acting is excellent, they Don't Make Comedies Like This Anymore these days movies that are ACTUALLY funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of vomit inducing body fluid as in those retarded Judd Apatow movies starring unfunny non actors like Seth Rogen, barf."
"4042","tt0102951","1138","3","This movie is a classic with actors who can actually act, and deserve all the accolades."
"4043","tt0102951","1139","1","There are few comedies like this, where almost every line and every character come close to flawless."
"4044","tt0102951","1139","2","This is soooo funny!!"
"4045","tt0102951","1139","3","And it has quite a bit of satire there to."
"4046","tt0102951","1139","4","Sally Field is heading the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good, if not perfect, job with her daytime tv diva."
"4047","tt0102951","1139","5","Sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top, but 90 % of the time she is a riot!"
"4048","tt0102951","1139","6","In the same league is Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg who unfortunately has too little to do here."
"4049","tt0102951","1139","7","Downey jr may not convince entirely as a comedian and has not the timing right all the time, but he struggles with his part which is, to be honest, the most ungrateful one."
"4050","tt0102951","1139","8","But the shining star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a true bitch if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret you will see in the absolutely stunning finale!."
"4051","tt0102951","1139","9","Sadly Elisabeth Shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part."
"4052","tt0102951","1139","10","I normally like Ms Shue, but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie."
"4053","tt0102951","1139","11","But it is not something damaging and for the most part she is at least adequate."
"4054","tt0102951","1139","12","Otherwise, brimming with memorable lines and situations, this is a comedy to watch whenever it is on TV or wherever."
"4055","tt0102951","1140","1","I have been a fan of this movie for years and years."
"4056","tt0102951","1140","2","Because of Teri Hatchers move into the forefront, I had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it."
"4057","tt0102951","1140","3","Why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me."
"4058","tt0102951","1140","4","Sally Field and Kevin Kline are beyond fabulous."
"4059","tt0102951","1140","5","Although I never have watching daytime soap operas, this movie kills me every time I watch it."
"4060","tt0102951","1140","6","The acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart."
"4061","tt0102951","1140","7","I highly recommend that you watch this if you haven't already."
"4062","tt0102951","1140","8","You will get to see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, and Carrie Fisher...to name a few...all give splendid performances."
"4063","tt0102951","1141","1","Anyone who doesn't laugh all through this movie has been embalmed."
"4064","tt0102951","1141","2","I have watched it at least twenty times and I still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes."
"4065","tt0102951","1141","3","Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise."
"4066","tt0102951","1141","4","Fields, at 45, still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children."
"4067","tt0102951","1141","5","I'm biased, I'm in love with her."
"4068","tt0102951","1141","6","The cast of ""Soapdish"" is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection."
"4069","tt0102951","1141","7","Kevin Kline is flawless, as are Robert Downey Jr., an ingénue Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of her early roles, Carrie Fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on."
"4070","tt0102951","1141","8","Kathy Najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer, and best of all, Cathy Moriarty as Nurse Nan who leads the plot to get Fields character removed from the show is hilarious."
"4071","tt0102951","1141","9","This movie should have won Oscars for best comedy, best leading lady in a comedy, best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses."
"4072","tt0102951","1141","10","Get the DVD so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years."
"4073","tt0102951","1141","11","You will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out."
"4074","tt0102951","1142","1","till HBO began rerunning it this month."
"4075","tt0102951","1142","2","I remember laughing out loud in the theater back in 1991, and now again in my living room."
"4076","tt0102951","1142","3","If I see that it's on, I have to watch it."
"4077","tt0102951","1142","4","There's just no question."
"4078","tt0102951","1142","5","This is so much more entertaining to me than other, more popular spoofs like Airplane!"
"4079","tt0102951","1142","6","which I really like, BTW."
"4080","tt0102951","1142","7","Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion."
"4081","tt0102951","1142","8","Quotes like ""Sudden speech!"
"4082","tt0102951","1142","9","The last symptoms of brain fever!"
"4083","tt0102951","1142","10","She could blow at any moment!"""
"4084","tt0102951","1142","11","put me over the edge."
"4085","tt0102951","1142","12","And Whoopie Goldberg hasn't been this funny since 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'."
"4086","tt0102951","1142","13","Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr. all turn in superb performances as expected."
"4087","tt0102951","1142","14","I started out giving this 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that for the type of film it's supposed to be, there isn't one thing I'd change or improve upon."
"4088","tt0102951","1142","15","So 10 it is."
"4089","tt0102951","1142","16","I have to get this on DVD, that's just all there is to it."
"4090","tt0102951","1143","1","I don't watch soaps."
"4091","tt0102951","1143","2","My grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass."
"4092","tt0102951","1143","3","I made fun of them it when I was ten it was so easy."
"4093","tt0102951","1143","4","But this movie takes parody and spells it a new way."
"4094","tt0102951","1143","5","I found the story pretty damn funny."
"4095","tt0102951","1143","6","The fashions of the 80's shoulder pads, sequins, and polyester just top it off."
"4096","tt0102951","1143","7","The huge hair, the high heels, and the histrionics what a combination."
"4097","tt0102951","1143","8","And all the actors just go to town, chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile."
"4098","tt0102951","1143","9","Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth wonderful!"
"4099","tt0102951","1143","10","Whoopi great!"
"4100","tt0102951","1143","11","Robert Downey refreshing to see him back when he had such potential, before the tabloids."
"4101","tt0102951","1143","12","And Garry: why did we have to wait so long to see him on film."
"4102","tt0102951","1143","13","Leesa Gibbons hadn't been missing her, but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter and where do you apply for THAT job, anyway.."
"4103","tt0102951","1143","14","Admittedly, I could have done without Sally climbing the drainpipe."
"4104","tt0102951","1143","15","Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times., as has every comedienne from Carol Burnett to I don't know who and I'm so done with it now, I could spit peanuts if I had them."
"4105","tt0102951","1143","16","Apparently it's what you do when you're being funny in a tall building in New York."
"4106","tt0102951","1143","17","I'm just thankful they didn't pull out the flagpole bit."
"4107","tt0102951","1143","18","But it was cute, it was funny, it had plot twists, it had an after credits ending before that was common, it had clothes worthy of a second glance, it had a great cast and it's got personal memories for me."
"4108","tt0102951","1143","19","Really, what more do you need."
"4109","tt0102951","1144","1","Way back in 1955, the British made a comedy called Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kay Kendall."
"4110","tt0102951","1144","2","To this day, it stands as one of the finest examples of British comedy and, more particularly, about how television sitcoms become so popular."
"4111","tt0102951","1144","3","It was, and is, an excellent example also of self referential cinema."
"4112","tt0102951","1144","4","So also Soapdish, a film I'd never heard about until a few nights ago when I caught it on late TV."
"4113","tt0102951","1144","5","I was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well, as you know."
"4114","tt0102951","1144","6","However, I was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime American TV."
"4115","tt0102951","1144","7","In fact, it's been a while since I laughed so heartily."
"4116","tt0102951","1144","8","So, if you like satire, I'd recommend you see it."
"4117","tt0102951","1144","9","The main actors  Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty  quite simply do an excellent job, revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is."
"4118","tt0102951","1144","10","As I watched it, I kept thinking to myself: just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life."
"4119","tt0102951","1144","11","That is, if actors ever do have a real life."
"4120","tt0102951","1144","12","As you probably know, Peter Sellers, for example, was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters, so that nobody really knew the real person."
"4121","tt0102951","1144","13","So, as I watched Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot playing Maggie, I thought again about that earlier British film with Kay Kendall playing Laura playing a character in a TV sitcom opposite Peter Finch..."
"4122","tt0102951","1144","14","Is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns."
"4123","tt0102951","1144","15","And that feeling was crystallized when Celeste finally confronts her daughter Lori, played by Elizabeth Shue and, in an emotional moment, repeats the fictional lines she'd used, on a prior episode of her daytime soap, when confronting her fictional daughter in that show!"
"4124","tt0102951","1144","16","Are you confused."
"4125","tt0102951","1144","17","Well, it's not all like that, but the dialog is stunning for originality, comedy, bitchiness, anger, depravity, duplicity, and even...love."
"4126","tt0102951","1144","18","The story."
"4127","tt0102951","1144","19","Well, there are many stories in this film, all interwoven, and which all come together at the end of course  but not like a Robert Altman film, okay!, and not all of them are resolved finally."
"4128","tt0102951","1144","20","Life's not like that anyway, right."
"4129","tt0102951","1144","21","The pace is almost frenetic, and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes."
"4130","tt0102951","1144","22","Spend the 97 minutes from your life and watch it; you won't regret the time usage."
"4131","tt0102951","1144","23","The rest of the cast all perform well, although I've never taken much to Whoopi Goldberg."
"4132","tt0102951","1144","24","Perhaps the funniest exchanges are between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and, for my money, the latter steals so many scenes from others, she gets my vote as the outstanding player."
"4133","tt0102951","1144","25","I kid you not, she gives the term bitch an entirely new face..."
"4134","tt0102951","1145","1","This is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change."
"4135","tt0102951","1145","2","As usual the lovers Sally Field as almost over the hill soap opera queen, Celeste Talbert; and Kevin Kline as marginally employed and marginally talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson are working at cross purposes, seemingly unaware that they are madly in love, etc."
"4136","tt0102951","1145","3","Owing a little to Bette Davis's Margo Channing in All About Eve 1950 and a whole lot to the slapstick theatrical tradition, Sally Field goes over the top towards hilarity as she malaprops her way to love and happiness."
"4137","tt0102951","1145","4","Kevin Kline, one of the more underrated leading men of recent years, is also very good and very winning as he manages to be handsome, vulnerable, egotistical and lovable all at the same time."
"4138","tt0102951","1145","5","The misadventures center around Celeste's fear of losing her audience as she has entered her forties, and reach the crisis point with the arrival of her niece, aspiring actress Cori Craven Elisabeth Shue who turns out NOT to be her niece, with ensuing plot complications."
"4139","tt0102951","1145","6","Cori manages to get a small part in the soap opera as a homeless deaf mute before discovering her true relationship to Celeste and to Jeffrey Anderson as well but never mind."
"4140","tt0102951","1145","7","As a romantic counterpoint or foil to the leads are Robert Downey Jr. soap opera director, David Barnes and Cathy Moriarty Montana and Nurse Nan."
"4141","tt0102951","1145","8","David Barnes is oh so hot for her, but she cares only about one thing: getting rid of Celeste so that she might shine more brightly on the set."
"4142","tt0102951","1145","9","To this end she gets Barnes to do all sorts of things to wreck Celeste's career, but through happenstance and/or a perverse logic, all his attempts go awry, much to the delight of the viewer."
"4143","tt0102951","1145","10","Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, the show's chief writer and Celeste's alter ego and confidant while Carrie Fisher has a modest part as the hard as nails producer of the show."
"4144","tt0102951","1145","11","I thought this was funnier than the only other spoof of the soap opera world that I have seen Young Doctors in Love 1982 which burlesqued TV's General Hospital and was pretty good."
"4145","tt0102951","1145","12","Soapdish is funnier with a daffy script and plenty of laugh out loud one liners and terrific performances by Field, Kline and Downy, Jr."
"4146","tt0102951","1145","13","But see this for Sally Field who is outstanding."
"4147","tt0102951","1146","1","This movie is about a fictional soap opera."
"4148","tt0102951","1146","2","It is very fast and funny."
"4149","tt0102951","1146","3","To say anything else would ruin the movie."
"4150","tt0102951","1146","4","There are several plots and sub plots in the movie."
"4151","tt0102951","1146","5","This movie has ensemble cast with today's hottest stars."
"4152","tt0102951","1146","6","They all gives over the top performances."
"4153","tt0102951","1146","7","This movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991."
"4154","tt0102951","1146","8","Soapdish is perfect for fans of either daytime soap opera /or prime time soap opera!!!"
"4155","tt0102951","1146","9","If you watch soap go check this movie it's hilarious!!!"
"4156","tt0102951","1147","1","Soapdish may go down as one of the single most under rated movies ever made."
"4157","tt0102951","1147","2","A stellar, unselfish cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it."
"4158","tt0102951","1147","3","While everyone hammed it up, there was no one upmanship."
"4159","tt0102951","1147","4","Kline showed wit and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking, I could just go on."
"4160","tt0102951","1147","5","Do not pass this movie by!"
"4161","tt0102951","1148","1","This is one of those movies like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero that holds a viewer's interest time and again."
"4162","tt0102951","1148","2","Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars, but whoever did the casting for Soapdish deserves one."

"4232","tt0102951","1151","2","The film revolves around the various off camera drama's that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced Daytime Soap Opera."
"4233","tt0102951","1151","3","The first of the film's various impressive strengths is it's fantastic A List cast."
"4234","tt0102951","1151","4","'Soapdish' features some of the greatest actors and actresses of it's era."
"4235","tt0102951","1151","5","The film is superbly led by Sally Field, as the neurotic ageing actress Celeste Talbert She famously throws a tantrum when put in a costume that makes her look like ""Gloria FCKING Swanson!""."

"4237","tt0102951","1151","7","Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy all elevate the film greatly."

"4241","tt0102951","1151","11","There also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time."
"4242","tt0102951","1151","12","In some ways, the film is reminiscent of Mel Brooks at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of 'High Anxiety' 1977."
"4243","tt0102951","1151","13","Much of the film's humour hinges on it's often scathing, but pretty accurate, representations of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors."
"4244","tt0102951","1151","14","For example, The extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by Carrie Fisher, is both hilarious and honest.'"
"4245","tt0102951","1151","15","Soapdish' is, for my money, one of the very best comedies Hollywood produced during the 1990's."
"4246","tt0102951","1151","16","It's excellent script and A Class cast make it a must see."
"4247","tt0102951","1151","17","It's hard not to love this film after it's kept you laughing for 90 minutes."
"4248","tt0102951","1152","1","The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive Sally's flagging spirits is enough reason alone to enjoy this movie, but wait!"
"4249","tt0102951","1152","2","There's more!"
"4250","tt0102951","1152","3","This is a crackling good sendup of daytime TV, movie stars on the way down, and up and the horrors of love."
"4251","tt0102951","1152","4","Robert Downey Jr shows the lighter side of his genius, and Cathy Moriarty is splendid."
"4252","tt0102951","1152","5","The dialogue is witty, and the physical humor done with consummate skill."
"4253","tt0102951","1152","6","This is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting, directing, and writing."
"4254","tt0102951","1153","1","This has to be, hands down, hats off, one of the most uproarious comedies ever made."
"4255","tt0102951","1153","2","Starting with the animated blowing, popping bubbles, the entrance to the Daytime Awards, the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet, the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech, the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co stars and producer, under phony smiles."
"4256","tt0102951","1153","3","Now THAT is only in the first few minutes."
"4257","tt0102951","1153","4","Then, all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous."
"4258","tt0102951","1153","5","Ridiculous in a good way, no, make that a great way."
"4259","tt0102951","1153","6","This was the first time I'd seen the always charming Teri Hatcher."

"4261","tt0102951","1153","8","Not a huge follower, but if I run across an episode I'd watch it."
"4262","tt0102951","1153","9","Robert Downey, jr., does a great turn as slimy, smarmy, snaky, sycophantic David Seaton Barnes, the producer who'd give his right eye to see Sally Field's Celeste Talbert leave the show, if only to finally get to get it on with Cathy Moriarty's Montana Moorehead."
"4263","tt0102951","1153","10","Moriarty absolutely shines in this movie, just as she had everywhere else she's appeared."

"4265","tt0102951","1153","12","or give one of her anti Celeste co conspirators an evil grin, and she has me rolling in the aisles."
"4266","tt0102951","1153","13","Yes, Cathy Moriarty is a very gifted actress, and one hell of a comedienne."
"4267","tt0102951","1153","14","Sally Field gratefully departs from the usual 70 MM sized Lifetime Tragedy of the Week movies, and we're all reminded why she is who she is today, having started off in comedy afraid of nothing."
"4268","tt0102951","1153","15","Her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor, but like a caterpillar in a cocoon, the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was."
"4269","tt0102951","1153","16","The thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy, serious roles, that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen."
"4270","tt0102951","1153","17","How lucky were the producers to land Carrie Fisher, if only for a glorified cameo."
"4271","tt0102951","1153","18","She doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen."
"4272","tt0102951","1153","19","She takes a role which, in the hands of a lesser actress, could easily have been forgotten, but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself."
"4273","tt0102951","1153","20","How lucky was Elisabeth Shue to get thrown in the middle of all this!"
"4274","tt0102951","1153","21","At the time, she wasn't really known for much."
"4275","tt0102951","1153","22","Adventures in Babysitting was kind of cute yes, I was dragged to an evening show for which I had to pay full price, but she didn't hold my attention much."
"4276","tt0102951","1153","23","But here, she makes the most of her character star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex co star and lover who, of course, turns out to be the niece's father, and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother."
"4277","tt0102951","1153","24","I'll stop there I feel I practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy, or at least a novela."
"4278","tt0102951","1153","25","If you've seen it, then reminisce."
"4279","tt0102951","1153","26","If you haven't, you've missed a real classic, but not really."
"4280","tt0102951","1153","27","The DVD's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years, and this movie is timeless, so what the hell."
"4281","tt0102951","1154","1","I think that this is possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen."
"4282","tt0102951","1154","2","Robert Harling's script is near perfect, just check out the ""quotes"" section; on second thought, just rent the DVD, since it's the delivery that really makes the lines sing."
"4283","tt0102951","1154","3","Sally Field gives a comic, over the top performance like you've never seen from her anywhere else, and Kevin Kline is effortlessly hilarious."
"4284","tt0102951","1154","4","Robert Downey, Jr. is typically brilliant, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer."
"4285","tt0102951","1154","5","I was never much of a fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she's great here as the one real person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of ""The Sun Also Sets"" that rumbling you feel beneath you is Hemingway rolling over in his grave."
"4286","tt0102951","1154","6","Either that, or he's laughing really hard."

"4293","tt0102951","1155","5","I don't like soap operas, even though I never watch them."
"4294","tt0102951","1155","6","But I do love this film because it's so crazy and off the wall, that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television."
"4295","tt0102951","1155","7","In my opinion, it's the best film of 1991."
"4296","tt0102951","1156","1","Years ago I did follow a soap on TV."
"4297","tt0102951","1156","2","So I was curious about this movie, and I was so rewarded for finding it."
"4298","tt0102951","1156","3","It's a marvelous spoof of soaps, with jealousies, the usual actors' insecurities, and all sorts of lovely excesses."
"4299","tt0102951","1156","4","But more than anything an amazing cast and an incredible script."
"4300","tt0102951","1156","5","How did someone get all those top notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie."
"4301","tt0102951","1156","6","And how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines."
"4302","tt0102951","1156","7","I never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it, but it's marvelous and I highly recommend seeing it."
"4303","tt0102951","1156","8","Sometimes I'll throw it on while doing housecleaning, and end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing."
"4304","tt0102951","1156","9","Many congrats to all who made it."
"4305","tt0102951","1157","1","This is one of the best comedy ever !"
"4306","tt0102951","1157","2","The writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast, well just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it is so great."
"4307","tt0102951","1157","3","If you're a Kevin Kline fan, he does as always an fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr is perfect."
"4308","tt0102951","1157","4","If you don't laugh while seen this movie, you don't have any sense of humor."
"4309","tt0102951","1158","1","A riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas!"
"4310","tt0102951","1158","2","This film is hilarious!"
"4311","tt0102951","1158","3","Admittedly, you have to have a taste for films with screaming, hysterical dialogue, over the top acting, and melodramatic plot twists."
"4312","tt0102951","1158","4","But if you do, you're in for one hell of a treat."

"4315","tt0102951","1158","7","But Celeste has been hiding a deep, dark secret, and the arrival of Lori and Jeffrey might just bring it to the surface."
"4316","tt0102951","1158","8","Add in the diabolical Montana Moorehead a wonderful Cathy Moriarty, in full ""gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode"", who is trying mighty hard to destroy Celeste's career; David Robert Downey, Jr., the weenie boy producer of the soap who's secretly plotting with Montana to ruin Celeste; and, Rose Schwarz Whoopi Goldberg, scriptwriter and Celeste's one true confidant, and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaos."
"4317","tt0102951","1158","9","Chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute does anyone remember 'Mixed Nuts'., but when done well, can be pretty damn funny!"
"4318","tt0102951","1158","10","A major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look."
"4319","tt0102951","1158","11","Field, Kline, Goldberg, and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm."
"4320","tt0102951","1158","12","Shue is clearly the weakest link here, but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by Field, Kline, et al."

"4339","tt0102951","1160","7","Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work together flawlessly until he finds out who she really is... a soap opera turn if there every was one!"
"4340","tt0102951","1160","8","The scene near the end in the chinese dining area had my kids and I rolling on the floor that scene alone is worth the rental price."
"4341","tt0102951","1160","9","Doesn't solve any world problems or show the seemy underbelly of daytime T.V."
"4342","tt0102951","1160","10","I hope."
"4343","tt0102951","1160","11","Just a lot of fun."
"4344","tt0120157","3202","1","I can't understand why many IMDb users don't like this movie."
"4345","tt0120157","3202","2","Why they think it's sooooo bad etc."
"4346","tt0120157","3202","3","It's not worse than anything else out there."
"4347","tt0120157","3202","4","Personally I think ""Soldier"" is a great movie, far better than most other films in the same genre."
"4348","tt0120157","3202","5","Reasons why I liked ""Soldier"": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the script David Webb Peoples, great visual effects, and the directing Paul Anderson."
"4349","tt0120157","3202","6","I even think that this is the best work I've seen from director Paul Anderson, who has previously directed the entertaining ""Mortal Kombat"" and the not so entertaining ""Event Horizon""."
"4350","tt0120157","3203","1","I think that this film was one of Kurt Russels good movies."
"4351","tt0120157","3203","2","Kurt russel is my favorite actor so I think that he is a good actor in any role he plays."
"4352","tt0120157","3203","3","But this movie had a lot of action in it and I know that it should have more then a 5.6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie."
"4353","tt0120157","3203","4","Oh well I thought it was good so I think that every one should see this movie."
"4354","tt0120157","3203","5","If you see this movie and like it I think that you should see Back Draft also with Kurt Russel."
"4355","tt0120157","3203","6","I give Soldier  1/2 out of"
"4356","tt0120157","3204","1","I loved this movie and will watch it again."
"4357","tt0120157","3204","2","Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self."
"4358","tt0120157","3204","3","I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie."
"4359","tt0120157","3204","4","His eyes conveyed more than most actors words."
"4360","tt0120157","3204","5","Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention."
"4361","tt0120157","3205","1","I saw this in the theater and I instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video."
"4362","tt0120157","3205","2","I am a big nut for Sci Fi action flicks though anyway."
"4363","tt0120157","3205","3","Without giving any of the story away, it is worth seeing if you like Sci Fi without requiring much thought."
"4364","tt0120157","3205","4","The story is basic, and the plot is very good."
"4365","tt0120157","3205","5","Worth your time to see!"
"4366","tt0120157","3205","6","Maybe they will make a sequel. :8 out of 10"
"4367","tt0120157","3206","1","I really liked this movie."
"4368","tt0120157","3206","2","Kurt manages to act without speaking, letting moments speak for themselves."
"4369","tt0120157","3206","3","He doesn't have to verbalize or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and takes action."
"4370","tt0120157","3206","4","He is supported by a good cast of actors and settings, and is able to show us a more humane side of soldiers without getting to corny."
"4371","tt0120157","3207","1","Of course, by any normal standard of film criticism, Soldier is a very poor film indeed."
"4372","tt0120157","3207","2","Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a Gladiators contest without the crash mats."
"4373","tt0120157","3207","3","Abandoned on a junk planet, he's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening, family life and, um, breasts."
"4374","tt0120157","3207","4","Kurt doesn't talk much."
"4375","tt0120157","3207","5","Finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away."
"4376","tt0120157","3207","6","Kurt gets angry and kills everyone."
"4377","tt0120157","3207","7","A planet gets totalled."
"4378","tt0120157","3207","8","The end."
"4379","tt0120157","3207","9","Unless the Academy start a new category for ""Best Explosion"", Soldier is not going to win any awards."
"4380","tt0120157","3207","10","However, as ludicrous as it is, it remains an enjoyable experience."
"4381","tt0120157","3207","11","The military hardware is the coolest since Aliens the APC's especially and, at 90 minutes long, it doesn't outstay its welcome."
"4382","tt0120157","3207","12","Please note that the below mark is only a guide."
"4383","tt0120157","3207","13","Knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you don't like miniguns.7 out of 10"
"4384","tt0120157","3208","1","I have to say I quite enjoyed Soldier."
"4385","tt0120157","3208","2","Russell was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity."
"4386","tt0120157","3208","3","Very watchable and nowhere near as bad as I'd been led to believe."
"4387","tt0120157","3208","4","Yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment."
"4388","tt0120157","3209","1","Interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to."
"4389","tt0120157","3209","2","However, i'll try."
"4390","tt0120157","3209","3","This was a very good action film with some great set pieces."
"4391","tt0120157","3209","4","You'll note I specified the genre."
"4392","tt0120157","3209","5","I didn't snipe about the lack of characterisation, and I didn't berate the acting."
"4393","tt0120157","3209","6","Enjoy if for what it is people, a well above average action film."
"4394","tt0120157","3209","7","I could go on but I've made my comment."
"4395","tt0120157","3210","1","SOLDIER is not as bad as many have made it out to be."
"4396","tt0120157","3210","2","I found the film to have some of the sacarstic, cynical humour like that in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers."
"4397","tt0120157","3210","3","The lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic book atmosphere."
"4398","tt0120157","3210","4","One particular trivia bit stands out for me Todd has the names of several space war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE."
"4399","tt0120157","3210","5","For the oblivious ones out there, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in Roy Batty's elegiac last lines in Blade Runner."
"4400","tt0120157","3210","6","To imagine that Todd could have fought alongside android troops like Roy is mind boggling to say the least."
"4401","tt0120157","3210","7","Maybe script writer David Peoples was nostalgic."
"4402","tt0120157","3210","8","I'll give this one 3 out of 5."
"4403","tt0120157","3211","1","this movie is ok if you like mindless action ,corny acting, and a very small plot !"
"4404","tt0120157","3211","2","The special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of""Event Horizon""."
"4405","tt0120157","3211","3","The costumes are like something from a mad max movie ."
"4406","tt0120157","3211","4","None of the soldiers talk ,so others tell them what to do."
"4407","tt0120157","3211","5","It eventually end up as a big shoot'em up movie with explosions all the place."
"4408","tt0120157","3211","6","I personally liked Russell better in ""tango and cash""""escape from la/new york"" and ""executive decision""."
"4409","tt0120157","3211","7","It must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie!!"
"4410","tt0120157","3212","1","I've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasn't as successful commercially or artistically as it should have been, and discovered considerable artistic merit which may ultimately have been its commercial undoing."
"4411","tt0120157","3212","2","First of all, this movie attempts ""serious"" science fiction, social commentary, more than action adventure."
"4412","tt0120157","3212","3","There is action in it, but that's not really what it's about."
"4413","tt0120157","3212","4","If you focus on that, you'll end up with as others have noted a bad ""Aliens"" clone."
"4414","tt0120157","3212","5","But, again, that's not what it's about."
"4415","tt0120157","3212","6","The movie is really about Todd's Kurt Russell transformation from human to near machine and back to human mostly back."
"4416","tt0120157","3212","7","But because it's not trying to give you a typically glib Hollywood style answer, Kurt Russell must make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions."
"4417","tt0120157","3212","8","And he really does a wonderful job it can take two viewings to appreciate it."
"4418","tt0120157","3212","9","The surrounding ""social logic"" is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether Todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human ness or what, but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for Russell's easy to underestimate talent."
"4419","tt0120157","3213","1","What a perfect example of ""Less Is More..."""
"4420","tt0120157","3213","2","Kurt Russell Sgt."
"4421","tt0120157","3213","3","Todd only has 72 lines, and something like 104 words."
"4422","tt0120157","3213","4","What a challenge!"
"4423","tt0120157","3213","5","Like a black and white photo, when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks, the facial expressions, the physical drama, the emotive gesture, all combines to make a stronger impact."
"4424","tt0120157","3213","6","This is one of those top 5 movies I can't live without, right up there with the classics like Road Warrior."
"4425","tt0120157","3213","7","If you liked this, check out ""Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior"" and ""Braveheart"" both starring Mel Gibson."
"4426","tt0120157","3213","8","Also ""Gladiator"" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was in Soldier also."
"4427","tt0120157","3213","9","The ""Thirteenth Warrior"" starring Antonio Banderas and ""Blade Runner"" starring Harrison Ford."
"4428","tt0120157","3214","1","I fell in love with this silent action drama."
"4429","tt0120157","3214","2","Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played this so well."
"4430","tt0120157","3214","3","Raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting, Todd Kurt Russell is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers."
"4431","tt0120157","3214","4","The stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born SOLDIER."
"4432","tt0120157","3214","5","Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham Kurt Russell owns this role and made it entirely his original, daring, and all too human."
"4433","tt0120157","3214","6","I miss the fact that sequels were never made.10/10 LD_________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/"
"4434","tt0120157","3215","1","This was excellent."
"4435","tt0120157","3215","2","Touching, action packed, and perfect for Kurt Russel."
"4436","tt0120157","3215","3","I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars."
"4437","tt0120157","3215","4","This movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering, and people who learn that there is a time for fighting, a need to defend."
"4438","tt0120157","3215","5","I cried, laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story."
"4439","tt0120157","3215","6","Good writing job for an action flick, and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid."
"4440","tt0120157","3215","7","The ending wasn't twisty, but it was still excellent."
"4441","tt0120157","3215","8","If you like escape from New York, or rooting for the underdog, this movie is for you."
"4442","tt0120157","3215","9","Not an undue amount of gore or violence, it was not difficult to watch in that respect."
"4443","tt0120157","3215","10","Something for everyone."
"4444","tt0120157","3216","1","Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable Kurt Russell gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Jason Isaacs, who has Todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants."
"4445","tt0120157","3216","2","Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise."
"4446","tt0120157","3216","3","Director Paul W.S."
"4447","tt0120157","3216","4","Anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout."
"4448","tt0120157","3216","5","Moreover, Anderson handles moving moments of humanity well Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant and stages the stirring action scenes with rip roaring gusto."
"4449","tt0120157","3216","6","Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of Todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions."
"4450","tt0120157","3216","7","Bang up supporting turns by Jason Scott Lee as brutish rival soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as the kindly Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as mute little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as crusty seasoned veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the jolly Johnny Pig, and Brenda Wehle as the sensible Mayor Hawkins."
"4451","tt0120157","3216","8","Better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might."
"4452","tt0120157","3216","9","David Tattersall's polished cinematography, Joel McNeely's rousing full bore orchestral score, and the first rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hybrid outing."
"1","tt0120157","3218","1","Nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci fi movie that's been vilified at the US box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of Kurt Russell's career."
"2","tt0120157","3218","2","I have my reasons."
"3","tt0120157","3218","3","Firstly when you read negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell's interpretation of Todd, the eponymous Soldier."
"4","tt0120157","3218","4","I'm going to start here too, with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting I've seen Russell pull off."
"5","tt0120157","3218","5","Todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense PTSD this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now."
"6","tt0120157","3218","6","The portrayal is spot on."
"7","tt0120157","3218","7","Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner."
"8","tt0120157","3218","8","He suffers from irrational anxiety keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger."
"9","tt0120157","3218","9","His hyper focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed, not cleaning up the cut or the blood."
"10","tt0120157","3218","10","Many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he's preparing and the food that will be eaten later."
"11","tt0120157","3218","11","Todd's dialog is spartan to say the least the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence."
"12","tt0120157","3218","12","Fear and Discipline we are told."
"13","tt0120157","3218","13","Always."
"14","tt0120157","3218","14","Fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by, keeping him ready to react on a knife edge."
"15","tt0120157","3218","15","Discipline to hold him in check through his fear, to overcome it and perform tactically."
"16","tt0120157","3218","16","The inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings."
"17","tt0120157","3218","17","Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from Nielsen's Sandra but I believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled, his movement and vision restricted Fear and Discipline indeed."
"18","tt0120157","3218","18","Then there is the subtext of his abandonment Twice in fact so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they've served their terms. 40% of the unemployed are ex military in OUR world, in HIS it can only be worse."
"19","tt0120157","3218","19","Russell quickly picks up the mantle of Mace's responsibility to his wife and child desperately in need of a mission, even one with such a high likelihood of his death."
"20","tt0120157","3218","20","Then there is the military subtext too the conflict between Busey's Church and the hotshot from HQ, Mekum."
"21","tt0120157","3218","21","Mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more accurate and aggressive."
"22","tt0120157","3218","22","Any one of them could pound Todd into the ground but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them."
"23","tt0120157","3218","23","An incentivized Todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit sent in without support, cover or reconnaissance."
"24","tt0120157","3218","24","It is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership."
"25","tt0120157","3218","25","There are many other subtle themes."
"26","tt0120157","3218","26","When a film is shot and scripted so minimally, it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root."
"27","tt0120157","3218","27","Watch Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches YOU."
"28","tt0120157","3219","1","This is a great movie."
"29","tt0120157","3219","2","It has a captivating story, an awesome main character, very good acting and killer action."
"30","tt0120157","3219","3","This takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story."
"31","tt0120157","3219","4","The story is very well done and there are no holes."
"32","tt0120157","3219","5","Kurt Russell is a solider named Todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives."
"33","tt0120157","3219","6","Eventually the military introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers."
"34","tt0120157","3219","7","Jason Scott Lee being one of them."
"35","tt0120157","3219","8","As a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like Todd."
"36","tt0120157","3219","9","They test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers, in the battle Russell is injured and assumed to be dead."
"37","tt0120157","3219","10","The military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don't realize is that Russell is alive."
"38","tt0120157","3219","11","Todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on."
"39","tt0120157","3219","12","For a while he lives there but can't adjust to normal life."
"40","tt0120157","3219","13","He rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people."
"41","tt0120157","3219","14","When they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert."
"42","tt0120157","3219","15","Just as Russell's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers."
"43","tt0120157","3219","16","What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like Todd and the other old soldiers."
"44","tt0120157","3219","17","So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily outsmarts them."
"45","tt0120157","3219","18","The military starts realizing this and Todd kills all of their men but one."
"46","tt0120157","3219","19","That one is Jason Scott Lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee."
"47","tt0120157","3219","20","Russell obviously comes out on top."
"48","tt0120157","3219","21","This is one of the best action films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot."
"49","tt0120157","3219","22","This has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines."
"50","tt0120157","3219","23","The writer also didn't forget that Russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women ""sir""."
"51","tt0120157","3219","24","There are no holes in this film, every minute has a purpose and it's very entertaining."
"52","tt0120157","3219","25","An awesome one man army action film for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action."
"53","tt0120157","3219","26","This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action/sci fi fans."
"54","tt0120157","3220","1","Soldier may not have academy acting or Lucas special effects but it definitely does it for me."
"55","tt0120157","3220","2","I won't tell you what its about, I'm sure you already read the summary."
"56","tt0120157","3220","3","This is a great doomed futureistic action/science fiction movie."
"57","tt0120157","3220","4","Kurt Russell doesn't say much, he usually has an eerie or drone look on his face but it fits the character."
"58","tt0120157","3220","5","There are great action and fight scenes; some of the scenes are unrealistic, but thats Hollywood make believe land that we should have to escape our normal lives."
"59","tt0120157","3220","6","I have not seen Soldier 2 but this one it one of my favorites."
"60","tt0120157","3220","7","I'm lucky enough to have a wife that digs on guy movies; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough guy/sci fi movies."
"61","tt0120157","3221","1","In the movie several references are made in subtly to Blade runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact the Cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs, breed to be expendable warriors."
"62","tt0120157","3221","2","But as favorite quote of mine from the movie is, "" you should have made them smart as well as fast""."
"63","tt0120157","3221","3","Kurt Russell did a incredible job, his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined."
"64","tt0120157","3221","4","Even when he falls in love with Sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after being expelled from the group, or his shuddering when he is given a hug, and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded Todd of himself, and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier."
"65","tt0120157","3222","1","The first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts: the thematic conflict between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity, and the physical conflict between Todd and his bio engineered replacement."
"66","tt0120157","3222","2","Both sequences are quite gripping in different ways."
"67","tt0120157","3222","3","Peoples' screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half way through the movie, which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp."
"68","tt0120157","3222","4","Nonetheless, kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to Kurt Russell who conveys much with very little."
"69","tt0120157","3222","5","Not a great film, but one worth seeing."
"70","tt0120157","3223","1","Ok, basically this is a popcorn sci fi movie, but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence."
"71","tt0120157","3223","2","You can count about 10 clichés that the film is building up to, but it only delivers on about three of them, and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot."
"72","tt0120157","3223","3","Kurt Russell's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding."
"73","tt0120157","3223","4","Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid, and want to rebuild your faith!"
"74","tt0120157","3224","1","I watched this movie expecting what I got: good sci fi cowboy stuff."
"75","tt0120157","3224","2","What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role."
"76","tt0120157","3224","3","Imagine trying to act under these two restraints: you have hardly any dialogue, and because you are playing a hardass, military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions!"
"77","tt0120157","3224","4","Howzat."
"78","tt0120157","3224","5","Kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct taped."
"79","tt0120157","3224","6","In spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed, Russell pulls off an incredible characterization."
"80","tt0120157","3224","7","His robot becomes human, in spite of the constraints."
"81","tt0120157","3224","8","Great job!"
"82","tt0120157","3224","9","As usual, Jason Isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered."
"83","tt0120157","3224","10","Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly, and gorgeous."
"84","tt0120157","3224","11","I'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take one's eyes off her."
"85","tt0120157","3224","12","Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited."
"86","tt0120157","3224","13","Much of the plot is quite standard, with a fair amount of weaknesses, but as it does have a sci fi comic book feeling, I don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses."
"87","tt0120157","3224","14","By the end of the story the good guy wins, and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction."
"88","tt0120157","3224","15","Yes!"
"89","tt0120157","3224","16","The sort of feeb who thinks that Russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point."
"90","tt0120157","3225","1","When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie."
"91","tt0120157","3225","2","Instead I thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating."
"92","tt0120157","3225","3","And you know what it worked."
"93","tt0120157","3225","4","Kurt Russel did what I though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was."
"94","tt0120157","3225","5","I recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film."
"95","tt0120157","3226","1","I don't remember this film getting a cinema release over here."
"96","tt0120157","3226","2","I only saw it when it came onto cable."
"97","tt0120157","3226","3","The film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines."
"98","tt0120157","3226","4","Specifically one person, the way he gets replaced and dumped literally into an off world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels."
"99","tt0120157","3226","5","Seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be Rambo in space, and would have been happy if it was."
"100","tt0120157","3226","6","I'm certainly happy it was'nt Kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple."
"101","tt0120157","3226","7","The scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this, albeit the decision for two slow mo replays detracts from the moment."
"102","tt0120157","3226","8","This is not a classic SF movie in the way that Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running, Logan's run or THX1138 were, however it is unfortunately the nearest I've seen to it in a long time."
"103","tt0120157","3226","9","He changes in the movie to a believable degree, he does'nt crack Arnie one liners, he does'nt become Snake Plissken and there is no definative happy ending."
"104","tt0120157","3226","10","That's why this film did'nt do well."
"105","tt0120157","3226","11","It did'nt follow formula, and among a 18 25 year old target American audience, that's unforgivable as it was was'nt what they expected to see."
"106","tt0120157","3226","12","Fear and discipline."
"107","tt0120157","3226","13","Always."
"108","tt0120157","3227","1","Kurt Russell is strong and mostly silent in this futuristic action thriller from Paul Anderson Event Horizon, Resident Evil."
"109","tt0120157","3227","2","Set on a garbage dump planet, Soldier plays like a cross between Rambo and Shane, with Russell barely speaking as the title character, an ""obsolete"" genetic soldier left for dead."
"110","tt0120157","3227","3","The supporting cast of colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and a surprisingly hirsute Michael Chiklis, is able."
"111","tt0120157","3227","4","They spend most of the movie being scared of Russell, and the rest of it running for their lives."
"112","tt0120157","3227","5","Russell's performance here is one of the best he's ever given."
"113","tt0120157","3227","6","With almost no words to say, he conveys emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and glances."
"114","tt0120157","3227","7","It is almost a mime performance."
"115","tt0120157","3227","8","When the action sequences kick into gear, he kicks ass and does so in a strong, silent, matter of fact way."
"116","tt0120157","3227","9","There are flaws."
"117","tt0120157","3227","10","Jason Scott Lee is brutish as a ""superior"" genetic soldier."
"118","tt0120157","3227","11","Jason Isaacs does a great impression of Frank Burns from MASH as a weaselly commanding officer, and Gary Busey busts a gut and nearly busts his girdle as Todd's mentor."
"119","tt0120157","3227","12","This is an underrated, and excellent sci fi flick, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of Blade Runner David Webb Peoples wrote both screenplays."
"120","tt0120157","3228","1","David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson...if it already sounds weird to you, then you are right, because it is."
"121","tt0120157","3228","2","Peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc..."
"122","tt0120157","3228","3","He covered these issues in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines."
"123","tt0120157","3228","4","Paul Anderson's first successful movie was a violent thriller."
"124","tt0120157","3228","5","Not surprisingly so have all of his other movies!"
"125","tt0120157","3228","6","And here is a violent thriller with moral implications!"
"126","tt0120157","3228","7","Peoples' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie."
"127","tt0120157","3228","8","Soldiers trained from birth, taught to kill, and never had a normal life."
"128","tt0120157","3228","9","They are replaced by better, genetically engineered soldiers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left for dead."
"129","tt0120157","3228","10","There he must cope with a group of refugees, some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here."
"130","tt0120157","3228","11","BUT THEN......"
"131","tt0120157","3228","12","The bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people."
"132","tt0120157","3228","13","Big, violent, loud action ensues and Peoples' script turns into an Anderson action fest."
"133","tt0120157","3228","14","It is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way, but the end product is better then I expected."
"134","tt0120157","3228","15","Entertaining, somewhat, though admittedly not very, thought provoking, and exciting once the action starts."
"135","tt0120157","3228","16","7/10Rated R: a lot of violence"
"136","tt0120157","3229","1","In a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government."
"137","tt0120157","3229","2","They are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever."
"138","tt0120157","3229","3","This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `Soldier,' directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell."
"139","tt0120157","3229","4","The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from preadolescence to adulthood."
"140","tt0120157","3229","5","Russell is Sergeant Todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier."
"141","tt0120157","3229","6","But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite."
"142","tt0120157","3229","7","A new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and Todd's generation is suddenly obsolete."
"143","tt0120157","3229","8","What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life: Fear and discipline."
"144","tt0120157","3229","9","Russell gives a commanding performance as Todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts."
"145","tt0120157","3229","10","He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes."
"146","tt0120157","3229","11","This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before."
"147","tt0120157","3229","12","And he's given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype."
"148","tt0120157","3229","13","Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen Sandra and Jason Isaacs Colonel Mekum."
"149","tt0120157","3229","14","Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee, memorable as Caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; Sean Pertwee Mace; Gary Busey Captain Church; Michael Chiklis Jimmy Pig; and Mark Bringleson Rubrick."
"150","tt0120157","3229","15","Anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science fiction."
"151","tt0120157","3229","16","`Soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact."
"152","tt0120157","3229","17","It's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference."
"153","tt0120157","3229","18","Much like `1984,' and `Mad Max,' this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share."
"154","tt0120157","3229","19","I rate this one 7/10."
"155","tt0120157","3230","1","OK, so Soldier isn't deep and meaningful like Blade Runner or as big budget as Terminator 2 but on the whole I found it quite enjoyable."
"156","tt0120157","3230","2","The fact that Kurt Russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant."
"157","tt0120157","3230","3","I found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than Arnie's in the T films and before I get comments yes I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same."
"158","tt0120157","3230","4","So to the film itself, a reasonable US/Brit cast are able to flesh out this little story."
"159","tt0120157","3230","5","Not really sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies, so was unable to decide whether I liked them or not."
"160","tt0120157","3230","6","The colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other."
"161","tt0120157","3230","7","Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career unlike maybe Escape from LA sequels are such fickle creatures!."
"162","tt0120157","3230","8","Sean Pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble Sci Fi lineage."
"163","tt0120157","3230","9","And the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly."
"164","tt0120157","3230","10","If you see this on your TV schedule I would recommend giving it a chance."
"165","tt0120157","3230","11","I don't think you will be disappointed."
"166","tt0120157","3231","1","Soldier isn't a great movie, and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons."
"167","tt0120157","3231","2","But I liked Soldier alot, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me."
"168","tt0120157","3231","3","First, the art direction is tight and well executed."
"169","tt0120157","3231","4","As far as science fiction backdrops go, Soldier was doing things with more design then 90% the genre."
"170","tt0120157","3231","5","The sets, costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed; I didn't love all of their future military style, but I was impressed with the effort."
"171","tt0120157","3231","6","For me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch."
"172","tt0120157","3231","7","Second, I'm a Kurt Russell fan."
"173","tt0120157","3231","8","I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ..."
"174","tt0120157","3231","9","The Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter films."
"175","tt0120157","3231","10","Soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero."
"176","tt0120157","3231","11","It's not an award winning role, but Kurt musters up convincing emotion with VERY little dialog."
"177","tt0120157","3231","12","Third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed."
"178","tt0120157","3231","13","This isn't iron monkey, or even the matrix, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre."
"179","tt0120157","3231","14","If you haven't seen it, and you like sci fi action films, pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice."
"180","tt0120157","3231","15","Just don't expect the next Bladerunner."
"181","tt0120623","8713","1","This movie is full of references."
"182","tt0120623","8713","2","Like ""Mad Max II"", ""The wild one"" and many others."
"183","tt0120623","8713","3","The ladybug´s face it´s a clear reference or tribute to Peter Lorre."
"184","tt0120623","8713","4","This movie is a masterpiece."
"185","tt0120623","8713","5","We´ll talk much more about in the future."
"186","tt0120623","8714","1","To quote Flik, that was my reaction exactly: Wow...you're perfect!"
"187","tt0120623","8714","2","This is the best movie!"
"188","tt0120623","8714","3","I think I can even say it's become my favorite movie ever, even."
"189","tt0120623","8714","4","Wow."
"190","tt0120623","8714","5","I tell you what, wow."
"191","tt0120623","8715","1","This movie is by far the cutest I have seen in a long time!"
"192","tt0120623","8715","2","Wonderful animation and adorable characters even the bad guys were cute!"
"193","tt0120623","8715","3","made this one a total winner in my book, and also in the books of those I saw it with."
"194","tt0120623","8715","4","I still want to see it again, but haven't had time."
"195","tt0120623","8715","5","Better than Toy Story, which was good too, but not THIS good ."
"196","tt0120623","8716","1","I thought this was a quiet good movie."
"197","tt0120623","8716","2","It was fun to watch it."
"198","tt0120623","8716","3","What I liked best where the 'Outtakes' at the end of the movie."
"199","tt0120623","8716","4","They were GREAT."
"200","tt0120623","8717","1","I have to admit right off the top, I'm not a big fan of ""family"" films these days."
"201","tt0120623","8717","2","Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental crap."
"202","tt0120623","8717","3","But this one, like TOY STORY, the previous film from Pixar, is a lot of fun."
"203","tt0120623","8717","4","The two lead characters were perhaps a bit too blandespecially compared to the two leads in ANTZ, but otherwise this film is better, but the rest of the film more than made up for it."
"204","tt0120623","8717","5","The animation looked great, the humor, though broad, was consistently goodI especially liked Hopper's line ""If I hadn't promised Mother on her deathbed that I wouldn't kill you, I would kill you!"", and the actors doing the voices, except the two leads, were all terrificDenis Leary doing an animated movie; what a concept."
"205","tt0120623","8717","6","And like everyone else, I loved the outtakes!"
"206","tt0120623","8717","7","I hope the video has the new ones."
"207","tt0120623","8718","1","This movie blew me away."
"208","tt0120623","8718","2","If you can see only one of the animated bug movies this year see this one instead of Antz. the plot, characters, and jokes are better in A Bugs life."
"209","tt0120623","8718","3","Also when you go stay in your seat until the end of the credits. it's the best part of the movie."
"210","tt0120623","8718","4","Rating 9"
"211","tt0120623","8719","1","I was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film."
"212","tt0120623","8719","2","If you sit close to the screen, you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures."
"213","tt0120623","8719","3","The detail, colors, and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than Toy Story."
"214","tt0120623","8719","4","How they were able to pull off the shading, I will never know."
"215","tt0120623","8719","5","I do hope that PIXAR will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so I can find out how all this was accomplished."
"216","tt0120623","8719","6","Based on this film, I think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film."
"217","tt0120623","8720","1","All of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of Disney Studios' last productions, here comes something that should heal your wounds..."
"218","tt0120623","8720","2","Once and for all, A Bug's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake ""hand made old Disneys like"" drawings see the Lion King, Pocahontas, and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that Bambi's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever."
"219","tt0120623","8720","3","A bug's life 1001 Pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks !"
"220","tt0120623","8720","4","succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say ""Hey, this thing is computer generated !""."
"221","tt0120623","8720","5","No weak parts, a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets, an astonishing 3D bird close to perfection in its imitation of reality... and that's only to mention the technical aspects."
"222","tt0120623","8720","6","The scenario, my friends, the real backbone of a motion picture, has some thickness !"
"223","tt0120623","8720","7","Curiously, and obviously thanks to Lasseter's team, there is practically no musical sequence in A bug's life."
"224","tt0120623","8720","8","Which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate, but most others dislike same thing for the parents or the anime fans, like me."
"225","tt0120623","8720","9","This movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase : the 3 Amigos ; it had basically the same background story a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen who finally turn to be actors to protect them, etc...."
"226","tt0120623","8720","10","Simple, but efficient, and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects."
"227","tt0120623","8720","11","Since Microcosmos, many movies tell tales of insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I do think that A bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all."
"228","tt0120623","8720","12","The humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved..."
"229","tt0120623","8720","13","And the whole audience was captivated by Flik's aka Tilt in France adventures."
"230","tt0120623","8720","14","A big thank you for Lasseter's team, especially for the last 30 seconds... it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs/actors forget their lines or hit the camera..."
"231","tt0120623","8720","15","And finally, especially for those of you who have seen the french version, other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie."
"232","tt0120623","8720","16","A bug's life is a really good piece of entertainment, and I think it will soon become part of my collection of videos a privilege granted to extremely few movies, and that's not a problem of storage room :."
"233","tt0120623","8720","17","Go and see it, that's an order."
"234","tt0120623","8721","1","Disney and the wonderful folks at PIXAR of course offer a nice, humourous story combined with the best of computer animation."
"235","tt0120623","8721","2","I admit that maybe the 'faces' of the bugs were a little more static than in 'Antz' and they only had four legs in 'Antz' six...."
"236","tt0120623","8721","3","But backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking."
"237","tt0120623","8721","4","But let this be a lesson: it was not the computer who made it such a success : it was the man behind the machine, who added the nice little twists, which I missed in 'Antz'."
"238","tt0120623","8721","5","Some highlights were of course the 'bloopers' at the end So keep watching at the end, it's worth it!, which were highly amusing and original."
"239","tt0120623","8721","6","The line 'Filmed entirely on location' was intended for the more attentive viewer."
"240","tt0120623","8722","1","For starters, it's a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around that are bound to make laugh check out the two Russian bugs."
"241","tt0120623","8722","2","A Bug's Life has a classical Disney storyline, but that's one of the good things about the movie."
"242","tt0120623","8722","3","Family values are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution in order to stand up against the grasshoppers in the end."
"243","tt0120623","8722","4","And it also has a couple of great voice overs by Dave Foley, Julia Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey of course,..."
"244","tt0120623","8722","5","But actually, the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation."
"245","tt0120623","8722","6","It's just wonderful."
"246","tt0120623","8722","7","All the details, great colors, every ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds..."
"247","tt0120623","8722","8","And the guys and girls at Pixar made it all look so realistic."
"248","tt0120623","8722","9","All in all, a very nice piece of work."
"249","tt0120623","8722","10","This is the best animation by Disney since Aladdin."
"250","tt0120623","8723","1","The animation was fab and the film funny."
"251","tt0120623","8723","2","The two circus bugs, Tuck/Roll were very funny."
"252","tt0120623","8723","3","If you waited till the credits at the end, you saw a very funny sequence of film, where they showed the bugs pretending to do things wrong like in other movies, that was clever as it made the characters more human and beliveable."
"253","tt0120623","8724","1","A must see by all if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one."
"254","tt0120623","8724","2","Easily one of the best animation/cartoons released in a long time."
"255","tt0120623","8724","3","It took the the movies Antz to a whole new level."
"256","tt0120623","8724","4","Do not mistake the two as being the same movie although in principle the movies plot is similiar."
"257","tt0120623","8724","5","Just go and enjoy."
"258","tt0120623","8725","1","I liked Antz, but loved ""A Bug's Life""."
"259","tt0120623","8725","2","The animation that was put into this paid off."
"260","tt0120623","8725","3","I will definitely be getting this on DVD."
"261","tt0120623","8725","4","By the way, Disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape."
"262","tt0120623","8725","5","I heard talk of squishing all of the characters into the screen on the standard video format."
"263","tt0120623","8725","6","Most will have to agree that the ending credits were the funniest!"
"264","tt0120623","8725","7","I only saw one of the two sets, but I can't wat to see the other one!"
"265","tt0120623","8726","1","Now this is what a family movie should be!"
"266","tt0120623","8726","2","There are few films of recent years that have been targeted at families or children that really are worthy of their viewing public; but this IS one of them."
"267","tt0120623","8726","3","My whole family came away from the film, awed, entertained, dazzled, and happy."
"268","tt0120623","8726","4","We're still quoting little anecdotes from it here and there."
"269","tt0120623","8726","5","The children LOVED it and so did we hubbie and I are 36 and 32, respectively!"
"270","tt0120623","8726","6","Apart from its beautiful and striking animation, the characters small as they may be, and imaginary as they are are very well developed."
"271","tt0120623","8726","7","There isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with."
"272","tt0120623","8726","8","The personalities bringing these little creatures to life are well casted voice talents, combined with the skill and artistry of some of Disney's best animators."
"273","tt0120623","8726","9","This is a film worthy of Walt Disney, himself."
"274","tt0120623","8726","10","I think Mr."
"275","tt0120623","8726","11","Disney would heartily approve of this new film..."
"276","tt0120623","8726","12","Flick, Dot and their fellow band of tiny heroes may become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time."
"277","tt0120623","8726","13","This is one the family leaves the theatre wanting to see again.. and buy to own on video or DVD."
"278","tt0120623","8726","14","I'm eager to see it again.. to pick up what I might have missed the first time."
"279","tt0120623","8726","15","Never have I seen my children so quickly and vividly identify with and embrace characters before... my daughter is still talking about little ""Dot""."
"280","tt0120623","8726","16","This film is funny, heartwarming, clever and great fun for the whole family!"
"281","tt0120623","8727","1","Bugs life is a good film."
"282","tt0120623","8727","2","But to me, it doesn't really compare to movies like Toy story and stuff."
"283","tt0120623","8727","3","Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie, but it wasn't as good as Toy story."
"284","tt0120623","8727","4","The film has the visuals, the laughs, and others that Toy story had."
"285","tt0120623","8727","5","But the film didn't feel quite as..."
"286","tt0120623","8727","6","I don't know, but I thought it was still a pretty good film."
"287","tt0120623","8727","7","A bugs life..."
"288","tt0120623","8727","8","I don't want to say this, is a film that I don't remember."
"289","tt0120623","8727","9","I saw it years ago."
"290","tt0120623","8727","10","Of course, I haven't seen Toy story in years, but I still remember it."
"291","tt0120623","8727","11","I shouldn't have reviewed this film, but I am."
"292","tt0120623","8727","12","I am giving it a thumbs up, though it's not exactly the best work Pixar has done."
"293","tt0120623","8727","13","A bug's life:/"
"294","tt0120623","8728","1","Pixar has had massive success over the years with the full length CGI animated movies they have made."
"295","tt0120623","8728","2","""A Bug's Life"" was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far, preceded by the company's feature length debut, the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"", which was the first ever feature length CGI movie."
"296","tt0120623","8728","3","I remember when this follow up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990's, but I never actually saw it until November 2006."
"297","tt0120623","8728","4","I watched it twice that month, and over three years later, I have seen it a third time."
"298","tt0120623","8728","5","It has never impressed me as much as probably any other Pixar film I've ever seen, but after three viewings, I still think it's better than some of the films I've seen from DreamWorks Animation."
"299","tt0120623","8728","6","Ant Island is the home of a colony of ants."
"300","tt0120623","8728","7","These ants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year."
"301","tt0120623","8728","8","One member of this colony is Flik, an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his inventions, even though he doesn't mean to."
"302","tt0120623","8728","9","One year, when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering, Flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it!"
"303","tt0120623","8728","10","The grasshopper leader, Hopper, decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season, but they will have to double their offering!"
"304","tt0120623","8728","11","Flik suggests to the colony's royal council that he goes and finds ""warrior bugs"" to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back."
"305","tt0120623","8728","12","Princess Atta, the future Queen, lets him go on this mission just so he won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering."
"306","tt0120623","8728","13","The inventor finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors, but after he takes them back to Ant Island and introduces them, he learns that they are actually not warriors, but circus bugs!"
"307","tt0120623","8728","14","The main reason why this second Pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters."
"308","tt0120623","8728","15","To me, none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have, and generally seem a bit bland."
"309","tt0120623","8728","16","Fortunately, however, it's not like ""Shark Tale"", a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character."
"310","tt0120623","8728","17","""A Bug's Life"" does have a likable enough main character, one which viewers can root for."
"311","tt0120623","8728","18","The story also seems somewhat bland at times, but for the most part, it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining, and sometimes has some good suspense, especially later on."
"312","tt0120623","8728","19","The humour, like certain other aspects of the film, isn't as good as it could have been, but there are definitely funny moments, some of them involving Francis, a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female."
"313","tt0120623","8728","20","You can always expect great animation from Pixar, and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception."
"314","tt0120623","8728","21","With all this movie has to offer, it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to Pixar standards, but it is reasonable family entertainment."
"315","tt0120623","8729","1","A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature."
"316","tt0120623","8729","2","This movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age."
"317","tt0120623","8729","3","The story is about an ant named Flik."
"318","tt0120623","8729","4","He brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers."
"319","tt0120623","8729","5","He gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess."
"320","tt0120623","8729","6","This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie."
"321","tt0120623","8729","7","The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's."
"322","tt0120623","8729","8","The story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice."
"323","tt0120623","8729","9","The voice acting is good as with most animation movies."
"324","tt0120623","8729","10","The music is nice to listen to."
"325","tt0120623","8729","11","Nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories."
"326","tt0120623","8729","12","Overall, this movie struck me as awestruck."
"327","tt0120623","8729","13","This is a good movie for all families."
"328","tt0120623","8729","14","I rate this movie 10/10."
"329","tt0120623","8730","1","Many of the American people would say..."
"330","tt0120623","8730","2","What... to my opening comment."
"331","tt0120623","8730","3","Yes I know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is right."
"332","tt0120623","8730","4","We have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village."
"333","tt0120623","8730","5","The great difference is the way that the story takes."
"334","tt0120623","8730","6","Our samurais, a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs, HEROES."
"335","tt0120623","8730","7","Please watch again this incredible movie the Seven Samurai, obviously and find another movies who has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the Masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa."
"336","tt0120623","8730","8","A tip is The 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to wrote his Best seller's, but he didn't found the third foot of the cat."
"337","tt0120623","8731","1","When watching A Bug's Life for the first time in a long while, I couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's Happy Feet."
"338","tt0120623","8731","2","As far as the main storyline goes, they are very similar, an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special."
"339","tt0120623","8731","3","It just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion."
"340","tt0120623","8731","4","A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar's sophomore effort."
"341","tt0120623","8731","5","Sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of Toy Story, nor is the animation out of this world."
"342","tt0120623","8731","6","However, the story is top notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with."
"343","tt0120623","8731","7","With plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot, I could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics."
"344","tt0120623","8731","8","There is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here."
"345","tt0120623","8731","9","Between our lead Flick needing to keep his self esteem up to save his colony, the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future, and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks, everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story."
"346","tt0120623","8731","10","Even the villain Hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons."
"347","tt0120623","8731","11","He is not doing it to be mean, but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1."
"348","tt0120623","8731","12","He needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth."
"349","tt0120623","8731","13","It is very much a circle of life, but not one that can't evolve with the ages."
"350","tt0120623","8731","14","When thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good."
"351","tt0120623","8731","15","Compared to Antz, the rival film of the time, this is much more realistic and less cartoony."
"352","tt0120623","8731","16","The water is rendered nicely, as is the foliage."
"353","tt0120623","8731","17","You don't have to look much further than the ants' eyes to see how much detail went into the production."
"354","tt0120623","8731","18","The reflections and moistness, despite the smooth exterior, shows the realism."
"355","tt0120623","8731","19","All the bugs are finely crafted too."
"356","tt0120623","8731","20","The flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on, whether for a small role or a more expanded one."
"357","tt0120623","8731","21","It is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments."
"358","tt0120623","8731","22","While Ant Island is nice, it is just the outdoors."
"359","tt0120623","8731","23","Bug City contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs."
"360","tt0120623","8731","24","It is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything."
"361","tt0120623","8731","25","From the ice cube trays as circus stands, the animal crackers box as circus wagoncomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideand crazy compilation of boxes to create a Times Square of billboards and facades, everything is done right."
"362","tt0120623","8731","26","As far as much of the humor, you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices."
"363","tt0120623","8731","27","No one could do a male ladybug better than Dennis Leary with his acerbic wit."
"364","tt0120623","8731","28","I dare you to think of someone better."
"365","tt0120623","8731","29","Our leads are great too with Dave Foley as Flick and Julia Louis Dreyfus as Princess Atta, as well as the always fantastic Kevin Spacey as Hopper."
"366","tt0120623","8731","30","Spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie, but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits."
"367","tt0120623","8731","31","Yes, A Bug's Life was the originator of animated outtakes from Pixar, a tradition that has continued on."
"368","tt0120623","8731","32","With many tongue in cheek bug jokes laced throughout, you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast."
"369","tt0120623","8731","33","Full of ""those guy actors,"" it is people like Richard Kind, Brad Garrett, and the late Joe Ranft as Heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs."
"370","tt0120623","8731","34","Overall, it may be the simplest story brought to screen by Pixar, one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years, but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience."
"371","tt0120623","8731","35","There are joyous moments, sad times, and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun."
"372","tt0120623","8731","36","Complete with a couple of my favorite Pixar characters, Tuck and Roll, there isn't too much bad that I can think of saying about it."
"373","tt0120623","8732","1","Lately I have been watching a lot of Tom Hanks films and old Chaplin films and even some of Rowan Atkinson's early Bean performances, and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work, something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages, in a way that just makes you feel good."
"374","tt0120623","8732","2","A Bug's Life has that same charm, it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects, because even though they talk, they still ACT just like real bugs."
"375","tt0120623","8732","3","It's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them, to imagine bugs the way a young mind does."
"376","tt0120623","8732","4","Honey, I Shrunk The Kids was one of my favorite films when I was younger, and to me, A Bug's Life is like a more realistic version of that movie, if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities."
"377","tt0120623","8732","5","I try not to compare it to something like Toy Story which I still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made, because the story of A Bug's Life is not quite as good as Toy Story's, but then again, almost nothing is."
"378","tt0120623","8732","6","The important thing is that it is still wonderful fun."
"379","tt0120623","8732","7","The story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society, mostly geared around building a harvest of food, most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers, vastly superior in strength and general meanness, and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter."
"380","tt0120623","8732","8","We are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers, who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food, the consequences will be dire."
"381","tt0120623","8732","9","And incidentally, the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to Mao Tse tung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the ""Great Leap Forward ""The fun and excitement begins when Flik, the main character, sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers."
"382","tt0120623","8732","10","You see, he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger, so he feels it's his responsibility, but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers."
"383","tt0120623","8732","11","Great for the audience, not so great for the safety of the clan."
"384","tt0120623","8732","12","The movie was released back in the late 90s, when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos, like Armageddon and Deep Impact, Independence Day and The Arrival, A Bug's Life and Antz, etc."
"385","tt0120623","8732","13","Comparisons between A Bug's Life and Antz are inevitable, although it seems clear to me that A Bug's Life is by far the superior film, and not only because it doesn't star Woody Allen stuttering and whining through the lead role."
"386","tt0120623","8732","14","This is great family fun!"
"387","tt0120623","8733","1","When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story."
"388","tt0120623","8733","2","As soon as I saw that I knew this was gonna be a good feature!"
"389","tt0120623","8733","3","I was right!"
"390","tt0120623","8733","4","A Bug's Life like Toy Story is great story, great characters and great animation."
"391","tt0120623","8733","5","My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft."
"392","tt0120623","8733","6","My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick David Hyde Pierce lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich's like You hoo Mr."
"393","tt0120623","8733","7","Early Bird."
"394","tt0120623","8733","8","How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim's like I'm going to snap!"
"395","tt0120623","8733","9","I'm going to snap!"
"396","tt0120623","8733","10","I just died laughing at that scene."
"397","tt0120623","8733","11","Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar film ever!"
"398","tt0120623","8733","12","I don't know how you could hate a Pixar film!"
"399","tt0120623","8733","13","I think they're all pretty good films!"
"400","tt0120623","8733","14","Good job PIXAR!"
"401","tt0120623","8734","1","The movie was totally Awesome and Cool."
"402","tt0120623","8734","2","The graphics was superb and it was amazing, Especially, Flik was superb and awesome in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent."
"403","tt0120623","8734","3","The circus bugs are colorful and they are superb in the movie."
"404","tt0120623","8734","4","The grasshoppers were also superb and cool in the movie."
"405","tt0120623","8734","5","Hopper was a pure and perfect villain."
"406","tt0120623","8734","6","Even, Dot was cute."
"407","tt0120623","8734","7","When, the bird comes to eat the bugs, that scene was superb and good."
"408","tt0120623","8734","8","Even, the last scene was awesome and cool."
"409","tt0120623","8734","9","Even, Flik's inventions was good."
"410","tt0120623","8734","10","Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the grasshoppers."
"411","tt0120623","8734","11","When, the ants are building the artificial bird, that scene was good and nice I should really appreciate the creators of ""A Bug's Life""."
"412","tt0120623","8735","1","Such a joyous world has been created for us in Pixar's A Bug's Life; we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film, but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation."
"413","tt0120623","8735","2","For those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when it's in the right hands that is  A Bug's Life is a warm reminder."
"414","tt0120623","8735","3","We walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling, and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions."
"415","tt0120623","8735","4","It is only Pixar's second animated feature."
"416","tt0120623","8735","5","The sub group of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995, with their landmark movie Toy Story."
"417","tt0120623","8735","6","It was a movie which defied convention, re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence."
"418","tt0120623","8735","7","Now, they return with their sophomore effort which, to be honest, draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film."
"419","tt0120623","8735","8","After all, it's a film about ants."
"420","tt0120623","8735","9","Well, all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bug's Life, but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film, as humans are the focal point in dramas, romances and so on."
"421","tt0120623","8735","10","How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie, let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film."
"422","tt0120623","8735","11","Surely they jest."
"423","tt0120623","8735","12","However, we forget that in Toy Story, a bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest, most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted."
"424","tt0120623","8735","13","The guys at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat, and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you'll probably ever encounter."
"425","tt0120623","8735","14","Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there isn't an unpleasant character in sight; even the villains are riveting characters  but they're colourful, they're eclectic, and they're idiosyncratic."
"426","tt0120623","8735","15","And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term, only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto A Bug's Life from the beginning."
"427","tt0120623","8735","16","We shall start with our main character, and our hero."
"428","tt0120623","8735","17","His name is Flik David Foley, and his character is rather generic to say the least."
"429","tt0120623","8735","18","Out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush, beautiful Ant Island, he is the one considered the 'black sheep' of the clan, as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season's harvest with his antics."
"430","tt0120623","8735","19","The problem arises in the fact that the ants' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper Kevin Spacey, who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants; when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone, they go insane, for lack of a better term."
"431","tt0120623","8735","20","Hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack's hands; however, it's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil."
"432","tt0120623","8735","21","The cogs and clockwork in Flik's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame, and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony's rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshoppers."
"433","tt0120623","8735","22","If you think about it, A Bug's Life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line's of Akira Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai, or the American remake The Magnificent Seven, in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city, finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil."
"434","tt0120623","8735","23","In A Bug's Life, the help comes in the form of a down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a bar room brawl."
"435","tt0120623","8735","24","Much amusement comes out of these scenes, and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs."
"436","tt0120623","8735","25","Among them are an erudite stick insect David Hyde Pierce, a side splitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and a quasi femme fatale ladybug who's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug Dennis Hopper."
"437","tt0120623","8735","26","It's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen, as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen, as is the entire movie collectively."
"438","tt0120623","8735","27","As I've said, much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another, which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines, wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie."
"439","tt0120623","8735","28","What makes A Bug's Life even better is that the film isn't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be, although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kid friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we'd like."
"440","tt0120623","8735","29","However, it's easy to ignore this fault, and it's incredulously easy to enjoy this film."
"441","tt0120623","8735","30","Although A Bug's Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor, this is still a superb movie, and the start of something promising here."
"442","tt0120623","8735","31","Pixar have proved that they're not just a one hit wonder, but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood."
"443","tt0120623","8735","32","They raise the bar endlessly, and when someone always manages to top their standards, it's only always by themselves."
"444","tt0120623","8735","33","What more is there to say about A Bug's Life other than: see it; it's not quite the best which we've seen from the folks at Emeryville, California, but this beats out the lot of its year  and I'll be damned if this isn't the best animated feature of 1998.8.5/10"
"445","tt0120623","8736","1","You will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the novelty probably won't wear off on the first, second or third viewing, but you.ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing, that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium."
"446","tt0120623","8736","2","Disney continues to firmly hold the title of ""Greatest Animation in the World"", with ""A Bug.s Life"" standing as one of their greatest achievements."
"447","tt0120623","8736","3","One of the innovative attachments being the delightful ""out takes"" added to the end of the film."
"448","tt0120623","8736","4","The DVD has two sets of these out takes where as I.m told the VHS cassette has one alternating version per tape."
"449","tt0120623","8736","5","The DVD also features ""Gerry.s Game"" which is a delightful little PIXAR short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters."
"450","tt0120623","8736","6","This is by far the superior insect film in comparison to Dreamworks."
"451","tt0120623","8736","7","""Antz"", which in all fairness is pretty good, but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters."
"452","tt0120623","8736","8","If you look at the star voices of both films, ""Antz"" is largely cast with big name ""movie"" stars with a few familiar ""TV"" star voices, where ""A Bug.s Life"" is just the opposite, loaded with ""TV"" stars with Kevin Spacey as the only stand out exception."
"453","tt0120623","8736","9","But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious."
"454","tt0120623","8736","10","Dreamworks can.t be blamed or surprised though, when you go head to head with Disney, you have your work cut out for you."
"455","tt0120623","8736","11","This is the kind of film that almost makes me wish I had children to share it with."
"456","tt0120623","8736","12","Don.t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids, though."
"457","tt0120623","8737","1","Critically, people say that Antz is better."
"458","tt0120623","8737","2","Antz is a good film, but I enjoyed Bug's Life a bit more."
"459","tt0120623","8737","3","I can't remember a Pixar animation, other than the two Toy Story films, that I was laughing so hard."
"460","tt0120623","8737","4","The animation is clean, the story is original and doesn't preach."
"461","tt0120623","8737","5","The voice overs are what make this movie."
"462","tt0120623","8737","6","Dave Foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot."
"463","tt0120623","8737","7","Hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot ."
"464","tt0120623","8737","8","There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on."
"465","tt0120623","8737","9","The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching."
"466","tt0120623","8737","10","It lacks the social messages of Antz, but what we have is rock solid entertainment."
"467","tt0120623","8737","11","9/10."
"468","tt0120623","8737","12","Bethany Cox"
"469","tt0120623","8738","1","A Bugs Life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too."
"470","tt0120623","8738","2","The story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil Grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food A Mirror of the Magnifiscent seven."
"471","tt0120623","8738","3","There is some wonderfull computer animation and the voices are great too."
"472","tt0120623","8738","4","You will love it!!"
"473","tt0120623","8738","5","8 out of 10"
"474","tt0120623","8739","1","This is a FUNNY film."
"475","tt0120623","8739","2","It has all the usual Disney components music, great range of characters, story, appeal, entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say ""Antz"" and ""Price of Egypt""."
"476","tt0120623","8739","3","The characters work really well, and have a strong appeal, and the humour is aimed at a wide level which overcomes generational barriers."
"477","tt0120623","8739","4","The movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format, which adds to the cinema experience."
"478","tt0120623","8739","5","Call me crazy, but I have seen the film three times, and I intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend."
"479","tt0120623","8739","6","Many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed."
"480","tt0120623","8739","7","I work in a multiplex, and I can honestly say that no one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction."
"481","tt0120623","8739","8","See it, and don't be put off because it is animated."
"482","tt0120623","8739","9","You are sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for the end credits!"
"483","tt0120623","8739","10","The bloopers and out takes at the end are the funniest part of the film, which is packed with laughs throughout."
"484","tt0120623","8740","1","There is great detail in A Bug's Life."
"485","tt0120623","8740","2","Everything is covered."
"486","tt0120623","8740","3","The film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw dropping."
"487","tt0120623","8740","4","The film isn't too terribly orignal, it's basically a modern take on Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, only with bugs."
"488","tt0120623","8740","5","I enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad."
"489","tt0120623","8740","6","It seems that Disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut outs."
"490","tt0120623","8740","7","The grasshoppers are menacing and Hopper, the lead bad guy, was a brillant creation."
"491","tt0120623","8740","8","Check this one out."
"492","tt0120623","8741","1","""A Bug's Life"" is like a favorite candy bar it's chock full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty."
"493","tt0120623","8741","2","The story couldn't have been better; it's clever, has ""heart"" emotion, and every character has a nice ""arc"" a growth or change."
"494","tt0120623","8741","3","By comparison, the only characters in ""Toy Story"" to have an ""arc"" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment of Buzz."
"495","tt0120623","8741","4","There are tons of laughs and cute moments in ""A Bug's Life""."
"496","tt0120623","8741","5","All of the actors turn in great voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is superb."
"497","tt0120623","8741","6","This serious movie buff doesn't throw around ""10""s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves the ""10"" I gave it."
"498","tt0120623","8742","1","originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast he was ""dazed and exhausted"" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completelyOkay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'."
"499","tt0120623","8742","2","So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being ""wowed"" by each frame visually."
"500","tt0120623","8742","3","How can you not empathize with Flik and his road to heck paved with good intentions life."
"501","tt0120623","8742","4","""Heck"" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant not to mention some of the other bugs in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy."
"502","tt0120623","8742","5","Of course, it's beautiful every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...."
"503","tt0120623","8742","6","Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing you can read their lips!"
"504","tt0120623","8742","7","try it!."
"505","tt0120623","8742","8","But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color."
"506","tt0120623","8742","9","No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story."
"507","tt0120623","8742","10","But, I'm glad to say, it's not!"
"508","tt0120623","8742","11","A Bug's Life has real heart."
"509","tt0120623","8742","12","Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them!"
"510","tt0120623","8742","13","Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door kids are smarter than you think!"
"511","tt0120623","8742","14","Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has."
"512","tt0120623","8742","15","This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing."
"513","tt0120623","8742","16","The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character so rare in animation and often in movies in general."
"514","tt0120623","8742","17","It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots."
"515","tt0120623","8742","18","Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not ""dumbing down"" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not."
"516","tt0120623","8742","19","All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point."
"517","tt0120623","8742","20","Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie; if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart; if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable; and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay."
"518","tt0125454","9671","1","Paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her youth was like growing up."
"519","tt0125454","9671","2","Tony Shaloub executes a flawless performance as an Russian Scientist PhD who cannot find decent work in America."
"520","tt0125454","9671","3","He befriends an isolated parrot while performing meanial duties of a janitor at a behavioral science lab."
"521","tt0125454","9671","4","The chief Doctor is a bitter man, as Paulie, who can speak and fully comprehend language and learn, embarasses the Doctor, who later banishses him to the lower levels of the building, where Mikail Tony S. finds him."
"522","tt0125454","9671","5","Paulie recants his life with Marie and how they lost each other."
"523","tt0125454","9671","6","The quest begins to reunite Paulie with Marie, only more than 20 years has passed."
"524","tt0125454","9671","7","The movie ends, some will say predictably, with Mikail reuniting Paulie with Marie."
"525","tt0125454","9671","8","The story closes with the three entering Marie's home, where you can make the final your own choice."
"526","tt0125454","9671","9","Great family film!"
"527","tt0125454","9672","1","I know, I know: it's childish."
"528","tt0125454","9672","2","But I just love this type of movie."
"529","tt0125454","9672","3","A bird that suffered a lot of ""mishaps"" and still hasn't lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor."
"530","tt0125454","9672","4","What's special about this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie the parrot and he's not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor."
"531","tt0125454","9672","5","Furthermore I like the storyline: Paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom."
"532","tt0125454","9672","6","By the way: Jay Mohr's voice almost sounds like Joe Pesci's!."
"533","tt0125454","9672","7","And Cheech Marin of course, the man IS humor to me."
"534","tt0125454","9672","8","Ever since I saw ""Up in Smoke"" I have appreciated his naive way of performing, making a simple situation a hilarious one.. can't help myself."
"535","tt0125454","9673","1","Paulie sounds like the most saccharine, lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find, yet it's actually much better than you might expect."
"536","tt0125454","9673","2","The daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film, but actually in most other departments the film is charming."
"537","tt0125454","9673","3","In case you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot."
"538","tt0125454","9673","4","Bought for a little girl with speech difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her."
"539","tt0125454","9673","5","He even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons, and eventually becomes a super intelligent speaker himself."
"540","tt0125454","9673","6","However, Paulie is sent away by the little girl's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from N.Y.C to L.A to be re united with her."
"541","tt0125454","9673","7","So, why does this awful sounding film succeed relatively well."
"542","tt0125454","9673","8","Firstly, it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects."
"543","tt0125454","9673","9","Secondly and far more significantly it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving, often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline."
"544","tt0125454","9673","10","Thirdly, it has several surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mohr as a wily crook, Gena Rowlands as a kind old lady, and Cheech Marin yes, the dope smoking Cheech Marin!"
"545","tt0125454","9673","11","as a musical immigrant."
"546","tt0125454","9673","12","It might not be a classic, but Paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages."
"547","tt0125454","9674","1","I didn't give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Seven Samaurai."""
"548","tt0125454","9674","2","However, this movie is so all around wonderful, it's a real shame it scores so poorly for the general IMDb voter."
"549","tt0125454","9674","3","However, the IMDb voter leans to the geeky, and ""Paulie"" doesn't qualify for that."
"550","tt0125454","9674","4","The only acting criticism I might suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg didn't portray the perfect stuttering child."
"551","tt0125454","9674","5","I'm sorry, but asking a 6 year old child to out do Dustin Hoffman as the Rainman is asking for the impossible in film making."
"552","tt0125454","9674","6","Moving past that minor complaint, the movie has the best of many films: buddy road trip, con games, hero as friendly party animal party bird., Disney like humor for young and old, etc."
"553","tt0125454","9674","7","What's not to like."
"554","tt0125454","9674","8","Tony Shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans."
"555","tt0125454","9674","9","That's normal for him, it seems."
"556","tt0125454","9674","10","""I'm Russian..."
"557","tt0125454","9674","11","I LIKE long stories."
"558","tt0125454","9674","12","I don't like mangoes, but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one."
"559","tt0125454","9674","13","Watch the movie and that will make sense."
"560","tt0125454","9674","14","Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin make very appropriate appearances in the film."
"561","tt0125454","9674","15","Roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them."
"562","tt0125454","9674","16","I have always found Jay Mohr to be a bit slimy, and his on screen role fits that as well."
"563","tt0125454","9674","17","The only surprise to me was finding that Jay was also Paulie's voice."
"564","tt0125454","9674","18","In the end, even that works well; put Parrot and anti Parrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its own."
"565","tt0125454","9674","19","If you are trying to find a film for you and the kids that is neither insulting nor boring for either, ""Paulie"" is a perfect candidate."
"566","tt0125454","9674","20","I will, however, admit that a happy moment colors my review of ""Paulie."""
"567","tt0125454","9674","21","I was on a road trip during a major heat wave."
"568","tt0125454","9674","22","The car's air conditioning died, half the restaurants had dead cooling as did our hotel and I said, ""let's watch a movie where there is working air conditioning."""
"569","tt0125454","9674","23","So we did."
"570","tt0125454","9674","24","So for 100 minutes we were cooled, amused, and given a heart warming experience."
"571","tt0125454","9674","25","When I saw it recently on VCR under less emotional circumstances, I realized just how well this movie was made."
"572","tt0125454","9674","26","It's a sleeper film you won't regret watching."
"573","tt0125454","9675","1","Most folks might say that if one were to spend a Saturday night watching a movie,you must be really bored."
"574","tt0125454","9675","2","Actually,I had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the TV and there it was,""Paulie""."
"575","tt0125454","9675","3","I had missed the opening credits,so I didn't know the name of it but I saw that it had Cheech Marin in it,so I naturally thought I had tuned into ""Born In East L.A."""
"576","tt0125454","9675","4","When I saw him talking to a talking parrot,I was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night."
"577","tt0125454","9675","5","Happy to say,it was better than that."
"578","tt0125454","9675","6","As you know,if you don't already Paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner."
"579","tt0125454","9675","7","Seems it's taken years to find her."
"580","tt0125454","9675","8","What should be Paulie's advantage is actually a dis advantage in ways."
"581","tt0125454","9675","9","People come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves."
"582","tt0125454","9675","10","While Cheech Marin's character ""is"" making money from him,he's not mean to him."
"583","tt0125454","9675","11","The dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute,I found them amusing."
"584","tt0125454","9675","12","Paulie,who's naive',learns quickly that not all humans are nice people."
"585","tt0125454","9675","13","Especially the owner of an animal research lab."
"586","tt0125454","9675","14","The man lies to him saying he'll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research."
"587","tt0125454","9675","15","Paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of Paulie's vocal ability."
"588","tt0125454","9675","16","Throughout the film Paulie's telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him,several other animals and finding the location of Paulie's owner."
"589","tt0125454","9675","17","It's a touching reunion. 8 out of 10,the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown."
"590","tt0125454","9675","18","That part might bother younger children."
"591","tt0125454","9675","19","Otherwise,it's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart."

"598","tt0125454","9676","6","The movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named Paulie."

"604","tt0125454","9676","12","Love overcame all the obstacles."
"605","tt0125454","9677","1","This movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids."
"606","tt0125454","9677","2","The movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level."
"607","tt0125454","9677","3","I watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny, entertaining,and heartwarming and did not see it again for several years."

"620","tt0125454","9678","9","Would have liked to have seen more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey."
"621","tt0125454","9678","10","I liked her artistic and poetic inspirations, a shame she could not share Paulie's reunion."

"661","tt0125454","9683","7","Rent this for the whole family, everyone will enjoy this."
"662","tt0125454","9684","1","This movie brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to get to viewers' hearts, directing this wonderful picture where life is viewed through the mind and heart of Paulie."
"663","tt0125454","9684","2","We discover from time to time, with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart."
"664","tt0125454","9684","3","I just couldn't stop my tears, even though the film has a happy end."
"665","tt0125454","9684","4","This is great, after thousands of films I saw through my life, ""Paulie"" really touched me deeply."
"666","tt0125454","9684","5","This is, after the ""Ugly Duckling"", the second picture that really turned me upside down."
"667","tt0125454","9685","1","A very refreshing story, the life of a parrot with an intellect higher than an average human's."
"668","tt0125454","9685","2","Shows humans from a bird's point of view."
"669","tt0125454","9685","3","Especially liked the portrayal of different types of characters that the bird spends time with."
"670","tt0125454","9685","4","Not all birds are bird brained..."
"671","tt0125454","9686","1","A sentimental story with a sentimental sound track."
"672","tt0125454","9686","2","It's about a little girl with a voice impediment who treasures her green parrot Paulie."
"673","tt0125454","9686","3","The parrot thinks and talks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion."
"674","tt0125454","9686","4","The parrot is definitely the star of the film."
"675","tt0125454","9686","5","At times mischievous and at times in fits of depression the bird captures the mood in a most remarkable and expressive way."
"676","tt0125454","9686","6","The synchronised voice too is very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists."
"677","tt0125454","9686","7","Early in the film her father gives the bird to a pawnbroker and the subsequent scenes tell the story of Paulie's constant struggle over many years to be re united with his mistress."
"678","tt0125454","9686","8","One of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people using the automatic teller machines."
"679","tt0125454","9686","9","Paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory."
"680","tt0125454","9686","10","The ending is predictable, but who would want it otherwise."
"681","tt0125454","9686","11","Children will love this film and anybody who keeps a bird as a pet will delight in Paulie's antics."
"682","tt0125454","9687","1","A talking parrot isn't a hugely imaginative idea for a new film, but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant, heartwarming film that will delight the whole family."
"683","tt0125454","9687","2","It manages to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel harshness during Marie and Paulie's separation, and all the events in the film lead to a hugely satisfying emotional conclusion."
"684","tt0125454","9687","3","The animal training is well done everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time."
"685","tt0125454","9687","4","Paulie is a great character and should have received way more success, though this film wasn't a highlight of 1998, unlike Saving Private Ryan."
"686","tt0125454","9687","5","This hour and a half will surely be an enjoyable one and one that you will remember."
"687","tt0125454","9687","6","Paulie's story is a moving, sad, happy and interesting one from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner, you will enjoy following him and watching him learning about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way."
"688","tt0125454","9687","7","Not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion."
"689","tt0125454","9687","8","9/10"
"690","tt0125454","9688","1","I approach films about talking animals with care."
"691","tt0125454","9688","2","For every wonderful one like Babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey."
"692","tt0125454","9688","3","Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential."
"693","tt0125454","9688","4","When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence."
"694","tt0125454","9688","5","But I found the film a pleasant surprise."
"695","tt0125454","9688","6","And it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising."
"696","tt0125454","9688","7","A Russian janitor, Misha Vilyenkov Tony Shaloub gets a job in a research laboratory."
"697","tt0125454","9688","8","One day, he hears singing coming from the basement."
"698","tt0125454","9688","9","And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out."
"699","tt0125454","9688","10","Misha becomes fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing, it can talk."
"700","tt0125454","9688","11","And not a few phrases either."
"701","tt0125454","9688","12","Its a parrot you can actually make conversation with."
"702","tt0125454","9688","13","The parrot is called Paulie voiced by Jay Mohr, and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha."
"703","tt0125454","9688","14","Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Paulie to tell him his life story."
"704","tt0125454","9688","15","Which all began when he was a baby, and in the care of Marie, a five year old girl with a stutter."
"705","tt0125454","9688","16","The two of them became birds of a feather OK, bad pun!."
"706","tt0125454","9688","17","When Marie's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away."
"707","tt0125454","9688","18","And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly."
"708","tt0125454","9688","19","Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey across America, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying great distances, and even ending up behind bars."
"709","tt0125454","9688","20","Of a cage that is!"
"710","tt0125454","9688","21","Paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s."
"711","tt0125454","9688","22","And although it wasn't afforded the same recognition or box office success of Babe, Paulie succeeds on quite a few levels, and is an occasional work of striking intelligence."
"712","tt0125454","9688","23","Jay Mohr's stand up style of acting is well suited to the part of Paulie."
"713","tt0125454","9688","24","He never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck."
"714","tt0125454","9688","25","Paulie's worldly, but he is also naive in his way."
"715","tt0125454","9688","26","Because he's lived a rather sheltered life with Marie, when he's taken away, he has to fend for himself for the first time."
"716","tt0125454","9688","27","And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie, which he believes."
"717","tt0125454","9688","28","Only for those promises to be broken time and again."
"718","tt0125454","9688","29","Paulie is admittedly a little episodic."
"719","tt0125454","9688","30","It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends up with, and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to Marie."
"720","tt0125454","9688","31","He first winds up in a pawn shop, where he is adopted by Ivy Gena Rowlands, a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners."
"721","tt0125454","9688","32","She sympathises with Paulie's situation, and drives an RV across America to find Marie."
"722","tt0125454","9688","33","Paulie is an occasionally very touching film."
"723","tt0125454","9688","34","His scenes with Ivy are some of the best."
"724","tt0125454","9688","35","Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers."
"725","tt0125454","9688","36","The way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought provoking: ""There are things in life you put off, because you think you're gonna do them later."
"726","tt0125454","9688","37","But the real thing Ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later."""
"727","tt0125454","9688","38","The scene where Ivy passes away en route leaving Paulie all alone is a very heart rending moment."
"728","tt0125454","9688","39","And the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon, soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film's over."
"729","tt0125454","9688","40","Despite the occasional sad moment, there are plenty of laughs to be had."
"730","tt0125454","9688","41","Paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant."
"731","tt0125454","9688","42","The animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number."
"732","tt0125454","9688","43","And Paulie even gets to have a romance."
"733","tt0125454","9688","44","Which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief played by Mohr as well."
"734","tt0125454","9688","45","That may be the only complaint I have."
"735","tt0125454","9688","46","As soon as you get comfortable with one situation, the film then moves Paulie on to another."
"736","tt0125454","9688","47","The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is funny, but a little disturbing too."
"737","tt0125454","9688","48","I'm amazed DreamWorks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film."
"738","tt0125454","9688","49","And Paulie's diamond robbery is very Mission Impossible."
"739","tt0125454","9688","50","He's caught in the act, and shipped off to the lab for animal testing, where he's remained ever since."
"740","tt0125454","9688","51","The story finally comes full circle at the lab, where Misha vows to help Paulie."
"741","tt0125454","9688","52","Of course they do find Marie."
"742","tt0125454","9688","53","But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, I was left numb for several minutes."
"743","tt0125454","9688","54","Paulie may never get the longevity Babe has, but I believe its an equally brilliant film."
"744","tt0125454","9688","55","The same laughs."
"745","tt0125454","9688","56","The same flawless effects."
"746","tt0125454","9688","57","And the same surprising intelligence."
"747","tt0125454","9688","58","A minor gem."
"748","tt0125454","9689","1","So you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh."
"749","tt0125454","9689","2","Well, think again."
"750","tt0125454","9689","3","Paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments."
"751","tt0125454","9689","4","The characters are all lovable especially Paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey."
"752","tt0125454","9689","5","It is journey worth experiencing."
"753","tt0125454","9689","6","Don't miss it!"
"754","tt0125454","9689","7","It is available on home video."
"755","tt0125454","9690","1","Paulie was cute, cool, enjoyable and quite fulfilling."
"756","tt0125454","9690","2","I went to this movie expecting to view a typical ""family"" movie, one that within moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor."
"757","tt0125454","9690","3","My mindframe immediately changed when I was quickly captivated by the movie's wholesomeness."
"758","tt0125454","9690","4","It is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be coined ""wholesome""."
"759","tt0125454","9690","5","Most are cheaply made, written and produced purely to attract young family members, who'll then drag the unfortunate elders to a mind numbing 65 minutes of overused sight gags and plots."
"760","tt0125454","9690","6","Oh yes, Paulie had a plot."
"761","tt0125454","9690","7","It told the story of a young girlMarie and her best friend Paulie the parrot, who unbelievably could talk and quite frequently held conversations with her."
"762","tt0125454","9690","8","Marie's dorky jerk father found this unbelievable, and thought Paulie to be damaging to his 4 year old daughter's mental health, and quickly tore them apart."
"763","tt0125454","9690","9","We follow Paulie's adventures and misadventures as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner, meeting many memorable characters along the way."
"764","tt0125454","9690","10","Oh yeah, Paulie really could smarttalk and had a swift New Jersey accent."
"765","tt0125454","9690","11","Cool."
"766","tt0125454","9690","12","The plot held thick and entertaining throughout, keeping me attracted."
"767","tt0125454","9690","13","Paulie is the best family movie I have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed."
"768","tt0125454","9690","14","Ever."
"769","tt0125454","9690","15","Seriously."
"770","tt0125454","9690","16","Pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie, with the whole family."
"771","tt0125454","9690","17","No sleeping."
"772","tt0125454","9690","18","I promise."
"773","tt0125454","9691","1","This is absolutely the best none animated family film I've seen in quite a while, back to the first Homeward Bound."
"774","tt0125454","9691","2","Paulie is a humerous movie about life through a parrot's POV."
"775","tt0125454","9691","3","It's a really touching movie and ranks high among family films, up to Disney status, IMHO."
"776","tt0125454","9692","1","I don't know who could find fault with a simply human and funny film like this with lots of delights for your heart."
"777","tt0125454","9692","2","I enjoyed each minute of it and guessed the ending half way through the movie but that did not disappoint me at all."
"778","tt0125454","9692","3","It will not only touch your heart but it's such a good family friendly film we need many more like these!"
"779","tt0125454","9693","1","I was very surprised with this film."
"780","tt0125454","9693","2","I was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his ""marie"" the little girl he was separated from."
"781","tt0125454","9693","3","The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do."
"782","tt0125454","9693","4","Actually i was expecting ""paulie wants a cracker"" jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference."
"783","tt0125454","9693","5","So if you wish to see a good ""animal that talks"" film check this one out, much better than Dr."
"784","tt0125454","9693","6","DOLITTLE in my opinion."
"785","tt0125454","9693","7","PAULIE also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well."
"786","tt0125454","9694","1","I was entranced by this touching and hilarious film, not to mention surprised."
"787","tt0125454","9694","2","I was also surprised to find that the voice of Paulie was performed by Jay Mohr."
"788","tt0125454","9694","3","The performance was so finely nuanced, neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the New Jersey swagger, that I thought that this must be some unsung old pro, not the baby faced Mr."
"789","tt0125454","9694","4","Mohr."
"790","tt0125454","9694","5","A very impressive performance, indeed, and it's gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky, indie films."
"791","tt0125454","9695","1","Some people might call ""Paulie"" a kids' movie, but I wish to assert that it's more than that."
"792","tt0125454","9695","2","Probably more than anything else, this movie successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the United States topical given the recent debates."
"793","tt0125454","9695","3","Portraying a parrot telling a Russian immigrant janitor Tony Shalhoub of how he searched America for his original owners, the movie tells several stories."
"794","tt0125454","9695","4","There's the elderly woman Gena Rowlands whom he befriends, then a Mexican immigrant Cheech Marin, and others."
"795","tt0125454","9695","5","All in all, it's a very well done movie."
"796","tt0125454","9695","6","I usually don't expect much from these sorts of movies, but this one is a treat."
"797","tt0125454","9695","7","I certainly recommend it."
"798","tt0125454","9695","8","Also starring Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado."
"799","tt0125454","9696","1","I'm no fan of newer movies, but this one was a real pleasure to watch."
"800","tt0125454","9696","2","Adults and children could watch it together how unusual!"
"801","tt0125454","9696","3","My aunt liked it, too."
"802","tt0125454","9696","4","It had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors and a talking parrot."
"803","tt0125454","9696","5","It reminded me of a favourite, The Wizard of Oz."
"804","tt0125454","9696","6","The hero, Paulie, an intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always keeping in mind his resolution to find his friend, Marie."
"805","tt0125454","9696","7","Highly recommended."
"806","tt0125454","9697","1","This is a really heart warming family movie."
"807","tt0125454","9697","2","It has absolutely brilliant animal training and ""acting"" if you can call it like that as well just think about the dog in ""How the Grinch stole Christmas""... it was plain bad training."
"808","tt0125454","9697","3","The Paulie story is extremely well done, well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too."
"809","tt0125454","9697","4","Not more to say except that this is a GREAT MOVIE!"
"810","tt0125454","9697","5","My ratings: story 8.5/10, acting 7.5/10, animals+fx 8.5/10, cinematography 8/10."
"811","tt0125454","9697","6","My overall rating: 8/10 BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND VERY WORTH WATCHING!"
"812","tt0125454","9698","1","I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE."
"813","tt0125454","9698","2","This film is not about the secret life of ALL animals who secretly can talk."
"814","tt0125454","9698","3","Instead, it is about a Parrot who learns to talk to help his owner, a little girl with a serious stammer, overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart wrenching scene early on."
"815","tt0125454","9698","4","Then the great journey begins."
"816","tt0125454","9698","5","Paulie the Parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend, Marie."
"817","tt0125454","9698","6","Along the way, he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people."

"819","tt0125454","9698","8","He gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him."
"820","tt0125454","9698","9","He recounts his tale to a sympathetic Janitor in the Lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Marie."
"821","tt0125454","9698","10","Tony Shaloub shines as the kindly Janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little Paulie despite the risks."
"822","tt0125454","9698","11","Jay Mohr plays the voice of the Parrot AND one of the seedy characters he comes across."
"823","tt0125454","9698","12","There is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too."
"824","tt0125454","9698","13","It is a witty, clever, epic animal adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a Bird and his little girl."
"825","tt0125454","9698","14","He search for Marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who don;t know much about Parrots."
"826","tt0125454","9698","15","Kids who have seen the wild Green Parrot Tribes in Los Angeles and Pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that Birds, especially Parrots are not disposable pets."
"827","tt0125454","9698","16","All children everywhere, will see that Pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured.so no BABE here, more of an incredible journey with a twist."
"828","tt0125454","9698","17","Enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts."
"829","tt0125454","9699","1","Something about ""Paulie"" touched my heart as few movies do."
"830","tt0125454","9699","2","It is a witty, funny yet emotional movie."
"831","tt0125454","9699","3","I'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie."
"832","tt0125454","9699","4","I didn't see ""Paulie"" until May, 2004 and have since ordered the Widescreen DVD from a seller at eBay."
"833","tt0125454","9699","5","The special effects of showing Paulie talking are superb."
"834","tt0125454","9699","6","My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases."
"835","tt0125454","9699","7","Probably my favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands Ivy's company followed by Cheech Marin Ignacio."
"836","tt0125454","9699","8","Tony Shalhoub Misha plays an excellent part as the good hearted human."
"837","tt0125454","9699","9","You root for him all the way through the movie."
"838","tt0125454","9699","10","You can't go wrong renting or buying this movie!!"
"839","tt0125454","9700","1","Somehow, this movie manages to be invigorating, bittersweet, and heartwarming at the same time."
"840","tt0125454","9700","2","Stars like Tony Shalhoub from Providence bring the tale to life."
"841","tt0125454","9700","3","The story itself is inspiring."
"842","tt0125454","9700","4","We see a desperate, up and down life through the most innocent eyes imaginable: a bird's."
"843","tt0125454","9700","5","Paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi girl with a speech impediment."
"844","tt0125454","9700","6","While she learns to speak correctly, so does Paulie."
"845","tt0125454","9700","7","However, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything being said."
"846","tt0125454","9700","8","The military father doesn't like the bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist, Ivy."
"847","tt0125454","9700","9","She teaches him manners, etc., while traveling across the country to find Paulie's owner."
"848","tt0125454","9700","10","The movie continues with several twists of fate, until Paulie ends up at a laboratory where he is eventually hidden away in a basement, and found by a Russian custodian, who is touched by the bird's story. the plot is in keeping with the simple, metaphorical theme that language is a gift, and a curse."
"849","tt0125454","9700","11","I would like to say that the soundtrack is astounding."
"850","tt0125454","9700","12","A beautiful mixture of flute, digital base, and horns enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy."
"851","tt0125454","9700","13","The sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery beautify the story even more."
"852","tt0125454","9700","14","And, as a final remark, the puppetry is entirely believable."
"853","tt0125454","9700","15","Unlike in star wars, where Yoda resembles a Muppet This film is one of my favorite movies, with the added remark that my wonderful parakeet of four years died recently."
"854","tt0125454","9700","16","Overall, I give this movie  out of four stars, two thumbs up, and a big hug."
"855","tt0132477","9025","1","The film belongs to Inventor Underdog genre."
"856","tt0132477","9025","2","Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a little acting verve to story with several standard elements."
"857","tt0132477","9025","3","Well filmed, well edited, with plenty of well acted secondary roles."
"858","tt0132477","9025","4","Some have declared this movie to be classic American hokey."
"859","tt0132477","9025","5","It is that and more."
"860","tt0132477","9025","6","I agree with those who say ""The movie celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration."""
"861","tt0132477","9025","7","The film is a pleasant reminder that achievement may be born of ordinary roots."
"862","tt0132477","9026","1","In my opinion, October Sky is one of the best movies of 1999..."
"863","tt0132477","9026","2","It totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need, like, wonderful story and good character interactions."
"864","tt0132477","9026","3","October Sky will remain in heart for as long as I can remember, and I just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film."
"865","tt0132477","9027","1","Above average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line."
"866","tt0132477","9027","2","Even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time."
"867","tt0132477","9027","3","A scent of ""Pleasantville"" camp hangs around this flick."
"868","tt0132477","9027","4","As a period piece, it's more accurate than not."
"869","tt0132477","9027","5","Its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy but moving."
"870","tt0132477","9027","6","Chris Cooper turns in a first class performance as Howard's coal miner daddy."
"871","tt0132477","9028","1","This movie will kick your ass!"
"872","tt0132477","9028","2","Powerful acting in a story that pushes all of us to live out our dreams."
"873","tt0132477","9028","3","Jake Gyllenhaal will go places from here, and the supporting cast was superb."
"874","tt0132477","9028","4","Why would would anyone want to stay in Coalville and develop black lung anyway."
"875","tt0132477","9029","1","I saw that movie few days ago."
"876","tt0132477","9029","2","This movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad that you have always dreamed about it you can have it."
"877","tt0132477","9029","3","This shows a big wish come true trought happiness and sadness, hopeless and failure."
"878","tt0132477","9029","4","But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something that you love you can make things different and be happy."
"879","tt0132477","9030","1","This film caught me by surprise."
"880","tt0132477","9030","2","My friend told me that this movie was a ""chick flick."""
"881","tt0132477","9030","3","Boy, was he wrong!"
"882","tt0132477","9030","4","This movie has a great family appeal, with no sex scenes like _other_ movies."
"883","tt0132477","9030","5","Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job in Homer Hickam's shoes."
"884","tt0132477","9030","6","The supporting cast is great, as well."
"885","tt0132477","9030","7","Science, coming of age, family quarrels, a great train scene..."
"886","tt0132477","9030","8","This film has it all."
"887","tt0132477","9030","9","The soundtrack is good, although the score is presented quite choppily."
"888","tt0132477","9030","10","The 50s music kicks the movie over the edge of greatness."
"889","tt0132477","9030","11","The DVD is definitely worth its weigh in coal."
"890","tt0132477","9030","12","Replay value is great I've seen it quite a few times already."
"891","tt0132477","9031","1","I'm sure things didn't exactly go the same way in the real life of Homer Hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book, Rocket Boys, but the movie ""October Sky"" an anagram of the book's title is good enough to stand alone."
"892","tt0132477","9031","2","I have not read Hickam's memoirs, but I am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation."
"893","tt0132477","9031","3","The film, directed by Joe Johnston and written by Lewis Colick, records the story of teenager Homer Hickam Jake Gyllenhaal, beginning in October of 1957."
"894","tt0132477","9031","4","It opens with the sound of a radio broadcast, bringing news of the Russian satellite Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in orbit."
"895","tt0132477","9031","5","We see a images of a blue gray town and its people: mostly miners working for the Olga Coal Company."
"896","tt0132477","9031","6","One of the miners listens to the news on a hand held radio as he enters the elevator shaft, but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness, losing sight of the starry sky above him."
"897","tt0132477","9031","7","A melancholy violin tune fades with this image."
"898","tt0132477","9031","8","We then get a jolt of Elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting: October 5, 1957, Coalwood, West Virginia."
"899","tt0132477","9031","9","Homer and his buddies, Roy Lee Cook William Lee Scott and Sherman O'Dell Chad Lindberg, are talking about football tryouts."
"900","tt0132477","9031","10","Football scholarships are the only way out of the town, and working in the mines, for these boys."
"901","tt0132477","9031","11","""Why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college,"" questions Homer."
"902","tt0132477","9031","12","Roy Lee replies, ""They're also the only ones who get the girls."""
"903","tt0132477","9031","13","Homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother, so he is destined for the mines, and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine foreman."
"904","tt0132477","9031","14","Until he sees the dot of light streaking across the October sky."
"905","tt0132477","9031","15","Then he wants to build a rocket."
"906","tt0132477","9031","16","""I want to go into space,"" says Homer."
"907","tt0132477","9031","17","After a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's Natalie Canerday fence, Homer enlists the help of the nerdy Quentin Wilson Chris Owen."
"908","tt0132477","9031","18","Quentin asks Homer, ""What do you want to know about rockets."""
"909","tt0132477","9031","19","Homer quickly anwers, ""Everything."""
"910","tt0132477","9031","20","His science teacher at Big Creek High School, Miss Frieda Riley Laura Dern greatly supports Homer, and the four boys work on building rockets in Homer's basement."
"911","tt0132477","9031","21","His father, however, whose life is the mine, does not support him."
"912","tt0132477","9031","22","John Hickam Chris Cooper believes that Homer shouldn't waste his time on the rockets, that the coal mines are all that matter."
"913","tt0132477","9031","23","The coal from the mines is used to make steel, and without steel, the country would be nothing."
"914","tt0132477","9031","24","The difficult relationship between Homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships I have ever seen in a film."
"915","tt0132477","9031","25","Miss Riley introduces Homer to the idea of entering the local science fair, with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship."
"916","tt0132477","9031","26","""You can't just dream your way out of Coalwood,"" she tells Homer."
"917","tt0132477","9031","27","Homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets, improving the models with each attempt."
"918","tt0132477","9031","28","Despite the many attempts, the boys do not lose their determination."
"919","tt0132477","9031","29","""What are the chances of us winning that science fair,"" O'Dell asks Homer in one of their more despairing moments."
"920","tt0132477","9031","30","""A million to one,"" answers Homer."
"921","tt0132477","9031","31","""That good."""
"922","tt0132477","9031","32","O'Dell replies, ""Well, why didn't you say so."""
"923","tt0132477","9031","33","The music, composed by Mark Isham, conveys sadness and hope at the same time, especially sad at a point when Homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of Coalwood."
"924","tt0132477","9031","34","Rollicking 1950s' rock and roll, including songs by The Coasters and Buddy Holly, occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers' lives with the lives of the miners."
"925","tt0132477","9031","35","The film, photographed by Fred Murphy, also uses colors to set moods and symbolize."
"926","tt0132477","9031","36","The town of Coalwood, actually filmed in Tennessee, is washed with blues, grays, and browns."
"927","tt0132477","9031","37","It's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything faces, clothes, houses, and roads."
"928","tt0132477","9031","38","When a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys, it is obvious that they are from the world outside of Coalwood and the Olga Coal Company."
"929","tt0132477","9031","39","The book on guided missile design that Miss Riley gives Homer is red."
"930","tt0132477","9031","40","The red stands out enough against the blue gray world of Coalwood to symbolize ""getting out"", but it is still subtle."
"931","tt0132477","9031","41","The reds are fleeting hints of a world that Homer only dreams of."
"932","tt0132477","9031","42","Jake Gyllenhaal expresses such zeal, hope, and pertinacity as Homer Hickam that it is hard to believe he isn't the real Homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film."
"933","tt0132477","9031","43","Chris Cooper is also extraordinarily believable as Homer's stubborn father, who doesn't recognize, or just doesn't want to admit, that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive."
"934","tt0132477","9031","44","Homer, and everyone who encourages him in his rocket building, is aware that the town is dying."
"935","tt0132477","9031","45","With the community disintegrating, the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys' demonstrations."
"936","tt0132477","9031","46","Again, I'm sure things didn't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them, but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism."
"937","tt0132477","9031","47","""October Sky"" has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real."
"938","tt0132477","9032","1","Maybe not the most original way of telling a story, we've seen all this before in many movies.. but.."
"939","tt0132477","9032","2","I liked it October Sky alot anyways."
"940","tt0132477","9032","3","It got something, Great directing and good acting by all parts, especially Laura Dernthe teacher and Chris Cooperthe father."
"941","tt0132477","9032","4","I wanna be a rocket engineer!:"
"942","tt0132477","9033","1","I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott 2000."
"943","tt0132477","9033","2","Both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship."
"944","tt0132477","9033","3","In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town."
"945","tt0132477","9033","4","Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them."
"946","tt0132477","9033","5","The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film."
"947","tt0132477","9033","6","Laura Dern puts in a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty 1999."
"948","tt0132477","9033","7","Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji 1995 and Jurassic Park III 2001."
"949","tt0132477","9034","1","This film was absolutely BRILLIANT!!"
"950","tt0132477","9034","2","Every performance in this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper."
"951","tt0132477","9034","3","It looks like Mr Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE film career if this is anything to go by."
"952","tt0132477","9034","4","I thought that Joe Johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbustersJumanji, Honey I shrunk the kids."
"953","tt0132477","9034","5","He pulls of every scene with sheer class."
"954","tt0132477","9034","6","My favourite scene was where Homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky, going down, as all of his dreams were, it was beautiful."
"955","tt0132477","9034","7","Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant, acting driven films as well as his Big budget blockbuster faire, which is also excellent."
"956","tt0132477","9034","8","KUDOS!!"
"957","tt0132477","9034","9","to all involved in this masterpiece!"

"960","tt0132477","9035","3","As a human being, it touched my heart and soul."
"961","tt0132477","9035","4","To watch the actors, you would think that they are the actual characters."
"962","tt0132477","9035","5","Laura Dern, a favorite actress of mine, left nothing out of her performance."
"963","tt0132477","9035","6","The young actors playing the Rocket Boys showed talent beyond their years, especially young Homer."
"964","tt0132477","9035","7","Homer's father inspired that eternal love/hate relationship between a father and son so that it felt real."
"965","tt0132477","9035","8","If you don't get a lump in your throat or shed a tear when that first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms, then get your pulse checked you may be dead."
"966","tt0132477","9036","1","My wife did not realize what a gem this movie was when she picked it up."
"967","tt0132477","9036","2","It is a story that shows real world success through hard work and determination."
"968","tt0132477","9036","3","That is so refreshing in a world of violent movies not that I dis like them, but you have to love a movie that succeeds without it."
"969","tt0132477","9037","1","October Sky is a highly lauded movie, and it¡¦s easy to see why."
"970","tt0132477","9037","2","The story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping, the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper, the hero finally gets what he wants, and it¡¦s a true story."
"971","tt0132477","9037","3","Frankly I think the director¡¦s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates."
"972","tt0132477","9037","4","We don¡¦t see any special narrative or cinematography; the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters."
"973","tt0132477","9037","5","We feel Homer¡¦s desire to earn his father¡¦s recognition and create his own future, and his resilience wins our respect."
"974","tt0132477","9037","6","¡§October Sky¡¨ reminds me of a later 2001 Japanese production of mini series ¡§Rocket Boy,¡¨ which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie."
"975","tt0132477","9037","7","Actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison."
"976","tt0132477","9037","8","When October Sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny, ¡§Rocket Boy¡¨ offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society."
"977","tt0132477","9037","9","Starring the outstanding actor Yuji Oda, ¡§Rocket Boy¡¨ focuses on three men as ordinary as can be: a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut, a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother like what Homer feels in his family, and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea."
"978","tt0132477","9037","10","The collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them ¡§impossible."
"979","tt0132477","9037","11","¡¨ To compensate for his lost ideal, Kobayashi Yuji works in the tour operator because it¡¦s called ¡§Galaxy."
"980","tt0132477","9037","12","¡¨ When his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him, he finally finds strength from his father¡¦s words, who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed."
"981","tt0132477","9037","13","¡§But I don¡¦t regret it,¡¨ his father told Kobayashi, ¡§at least I tried."
"982","tt0132477","9037","14","¡¨ It is his father¡¦s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair."
"983","tt0132477","9037","15","Kobayashi¡¦s effort finally fails, and he goes back to the travel agency."

"985","tt0132477","9037","17","Just before the end of the series, Kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts."
"986","tt0132477","9037","18","After the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree, unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says: ¡§Astronauts Wanted for 2004."
"987","tt0132477","9037","19","¡¨ Kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs, just like a kid looking at his ticket to Disneyland."
"988","tt0132477","9037","20","Kobayashi may never get what he wants, but he dares his destiny and ¡§just does it."
"989","tt0132477","9037","21","¡¨ This series is so heart gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds, but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy."
"990","tt0132477","9037","22","Unlike Dilbert or other sarcastic writings, this show enlightens us and teaches us something."
"991","tt0132477","9037","23","Homer and Kobayashi both have the dream, and they do what they can despite other people¡¦s opinions."
"992","tt0132477","9037","24","I recommend other IMDB users to see the Japanese TV series."
"993","tt0132477","9037","25","If you are a nine to fiver, you will feel more touched."
"994","tt0132477","9037","26","I feel sorry that IMDB doesn¡¦t have its data, maybe you can ask somebody from Japan to help you."
"995","tt0132477","9038","1","I loved October Sky."
"996","tt0132477","9038","2","The thing I loved most had to be the music."
"997","tt0132477","9038","3","It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time frame."
"998","tt0132477","9038","4","This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties."
"999","tt0132477","9038","5","In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over."
"1000","tt0132477","9038","6","The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly."
"1001","tt0132477","9038","7","I did not only enjoy the music, I also quite enjoyed the cast."
"1002","tt0132477","9038","8","Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me."
"1003","tt0132477","9038","9","He gave off a first class performance, as did Chris Owen Quentin and Chris Cooper John Hickam."
"1004","tt0132477","9038","10","I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself."
"1005","tt0132477","9039","1","I grew up in Southern West Virginia; I'm about the same age as or maybe a year older than Homer Hickam, author of ""The Rocket Boys,"" the book forming the true story basis of this heart warming film."
"1006","tt0132477","9039","2","And so I relate closely to the West Virginia coal mining theme, and to the stunning effect Sputnik had at that time October 4, 1957 on all of us."
"1007","tt0132477","9039","3","The Rocket Boys went on to make great lives for themselves."
"1008","tt0132477","9039","4","I went on to get my degrees in Physics and Computer Engineering."
"1009","tt0132477","9039","5","All because Sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the ""Science Gap"" the U.S.S.R. had on the U.S. in those Cold War days..."
"1010","tt0132477","9039","6","This is a wonderful film for everyone, of all ages."
"1011","tt0132477","9039","7","But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950's, it'll touch the core of your being."
"1012","tt0132477","9039","8","Everyone: Get it; watch it; recommend it to your friends... who'll thank you many times."
"1013","tt0132477","9040","1","A true wholesome American story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural West Virginia coal mining town, after the launch of Sputnik in 1957."
"1014","tt0132477","9040","2","Through trial, tribulations and perseverance beyond belief, they are ultimately able to achieve their goals."
"1015","tt0132477","9040","3","Jake Gyllenhaal, as the leader of the group, is excellent in the title role."
"1016","tt0132477","9040","4","As his motivating science teacher, Laura Linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the top."
"1017","tt0132477","9040","5","There is a standout supporting performance by Chris Cooper, a head miner, who wants his son to follow in his footsteps, but gradually comes around at film's end."
"1018","tt0132477","9040","6","What makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever."
"1019","tt0132477","9040","7","It is the epitome of an American story that is well done."
"1020","tt0132477","9040","8","Besides the science angle, we have the father son disagreement, football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining, and the loving spirit of family."
"1021","tt0132477","9040","9","Why aren't pictures like this recognized more at award times."
"1022","tt0132477","9041","1","Based on fact, this is the story of a teenager named Homer Hickam Jake Gyllenhaal, growing up in a coal town in West Virginia where a boy's usual destiny was to ""end up in the mines."""
"1023","tt0132477","9041","2","But Homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets, to the dismay of his mine foreman father, and the consternation of the townsfolk generally."
"1024","tt0132477","9041","3","A misfit for sure, he and three of his equally outcast buddies begin making rockets, which they fly from a patch of barren land eight miles out of town, so as to no longer terrorize the community with their oft times errant rockets."
"1025","tt0132477","9041","4","Unfortunately, most of the town and especially Homer's father Chris Cooper thinks that they are wasting their time."
"1026","tt0132477","9041","5","However, the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in droves to watch the 'Rocketboys' send off their homemade missiles."
"1027","tt0132477","9041","6","Only one teacher Laura Dern in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize."
"1028","tt0132477","9041","7","Now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars."
"1029","tt0132477","9041","8","Director Joe Johnston has always been a famous name for his movies such as Jumanji & Jurassic Park 3 & ""October Sky"" surely stands above all of his other films."
"1030","tt0132477","9041","9","Without any doubts, ""October Sky"" is his best effort & obviously his best film."
"1031","tt0132477","9041","10","It's not only a true story filmed extremely well, but even as a movie, it has every single thing, which is required for a top level cinema."
"1032","tt0132477","9041","11","And along with Johnston's extra ordinary direction, are some exceptional performances."
"1033","tt0132477","9041","12","Jake Gyllenhaal was around 19, when this movie was released & he gives a beautiful & natural performance."
"1034","tt0132477","9041","13","He is a perfect actor."
"1035","tt0132477","9041","14","Chris Cooper as his father, also gives a very fine performance."
"1036","tt0132477","9041","15","The same goes for Laura Dern & also she looks beautiful."
"1037","tt0132477","9041","16","Even the rest of the performances are extremely well."
"1038","tt0132477","9041","17","The background score was fine."
"1039","tt0132477","9041","18","Highly inspiring movie, which lifts up your spirit sky high."
"1040","tt0132477","9041","19","One of those movies which definitely inspires you for all of your life."
"1041","tt0132477","9041","20","An amazing inspiring movie along with loads of entertainment."
"1042","tt0132477","9041","21","Not to be missed."
"1043","tt0132477","9042","1","I think I read this someplace: Joe Johnston director of the film and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic for work on the first Star Wars film and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie, ""Rocket Boys"" I guess was lacking something."
"1044","tt0132477","9042","2","One day they were messing with a PC program that forms words from other words ie: you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words I think the technical term is an ""anagram""Anyway, they typed in ""Rocket Boys"" and sure enough what comes back is ""October Sky""."
"1045","tt0132477","9042","3","They were shocked to say the least."
"1046","tt0132477","9042","4","The title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around Sputnik."
"1047","tt0132477","9042","5","At first Homer Jr did not like the idea, but he warmed up to it after the ""movie poster paperback novel"" came out and took off."
"1048","tt0132477","9043","1","I just accidentally stumbled over this film on TV one day."
"1049","tt0132477","9043","2","It was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies."
"1050","tt0132477","9043","3","This one, however, was nothing less then good."
"1051","tt0132477","9043","4","October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the Sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist."
"1052","tt0132477","9043","5","He and his friends begin to build rockets."
"1053","tt0132477","9043","6","His father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal miner as himself or go to college on a football scholarship like his brother."
"1054","tt0132477","9043","7","The story is well written."
"1055","tt0132477","9043","8","A bit too predictable maybe, but that's OK cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story."
"1056","tt0132477","9043","9","It's important part, but where this is obvious the inner action, the action between the characters is focused on."
"1057","tt0132477","9043","10","The story is good."
"1058","tt0132477","9043","11","It has some clichés, but that's OK."
"1059","tt0132477","9043","12","It's based on actual event's so you kind of can't just drop out these clichés."
"1060","tt0132477","9043","13","The characters are really good."
"1061","tt0132477","9043","14","Where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high."
"1062","tt0132477","9043","15","You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them."
"1063","tt0132477","9043","16","They are well written and believable."

"1069","tt0132477","9043","22","As for the rest of the cast they are good too."
"1070","tt0132477","9043","23","All together this makes out a pretty strong cast."
"1071","tt0132477","9043","24","All in all I'm glad I caught this movie."
"1072","tt0132477","9043","25","It was first after seeing it I learned that it was based on actual events."
"1073","tt0132477","9043","26","If I had known that when seeing it, it would probably just be even more interesting."

"1076","tt0132477","9043","29","It's kind of a feel good movie."
"1077","tt0132477","9043","30","Not bad at all!"
"1078","tt0132477","9044","1","I have recently seen this movie due to Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain."
"1079","tt0132477","9044","2","I figured I would see the movies that I missed."
"1080","tt0132477","9044","3","I had no expectations going into the film so was astounded that I had missed this movie at all."
"1081","tt0132477","9044","4","It's a gripping father and son tale, and it is also an underdog story."
"1082","tt0132477","9044","5","I even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale."
"1083","tt0132477","9044","6","This movie appeals to all ages."
"1084","tt0132477","9044","7","The only reason I give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a little in the middle, but it comes back strong in the end."
"1085","tt0132477","9044","8","The acting was great, the story was magnificent, and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film."
"1086","tt0132477","9044","9","GO SEE THIS MOVIE!"
"1087","tt0132477","9044","10","Rent it, buy it, watch it, LOVE IT!"
"1088","tt0132477","9044","11","I know I did!"
"1089","tt0132477","9045","1","There is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where Homer watches the attempt of December 6, 1957 at least that was the video used on the TV he was watching which showed the Vangard launch attempt, which failed."
"1090","tt0132477","9045","2","He is next shown reading or dictating a letter to Dr."
"1091","tt0132477","9045","3","Von Braun offering condolences about the failure."
"1092","tt0132477","9045","4","Von Braun was at Marshall space flight center in Huntsville working for the Army."
"1093","tt0132477","9045","5","The Vanguard project was by the early Nasa team which was at what soon became Goddard Space flight center."
"1094","tt0132477","9045","6","The army rushed the Jupiter C, which was essentially a US made V2 technology, but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik."
"1095","tt0132477","9045","7","This error may have actually been made by Homer, because of the notoriety of Von Braun, but his team didn't have their attempt fail."
"1096","tt0132477","9045","8","In fact the underlying Redstone was flying from 52 and was the first US man rated booster, used for Shepard's sub orbital flight, as well as Grissom's."
"1097","tt0132477","9045","9","This is why this sort of movie is so good, as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia, and in the process see what has been done, and be inspired to do more."
"1098","tt0132477","9046","1","I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead 2005 a little while back and, since then, I've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen."
"1099","tt0132477","9046","2","Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity and he even resembles Owen somewhat that just oozes from the screen."
"1100","tt0132477","9046","3","I feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, he'll crack an Oscar one day..."
"1101","tt0132477","9046","4","That's not to denigrate this film at all."
"1102","tt0132477","9046","5","It's a fine story, with very believable people well, it's based upon the author's early shenanigans with rocketry, a great cast  Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list  with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement...and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping."
"1103","tt0132477","9046","6","But, this film had a very special significance for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the night stars to watch Sputnik as it scudded across the blackness; like Homer also, I experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster!"
"1104","tt0132477","9046","7","What fun it was..."
"1105","tt0132477","9046","8","I didn't achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though."
"1106","tt0132477","9046","9","But, that's what you find out when you see this movie."
"1107","tt0132477","9046","10","Sure, it's a basic family movie, but that's a dying breed these days, it seems."
"1108","tt0132477","9046","11","Take the time to see it, with the kids: you'll all have a lot of good laughs."
"1109","tt0132477","9047","1","A simple and effective film about what life is all about, responding to challenges."
"1110","tt0132477","9047","2","It took a lot of gall for Homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son, to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate."
"1111","tt0132477","9047","3","It took also three different challenges for Homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future."
"1112","tt0132477","9047","4","The challenge of the first ever man made artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, a Soviet satellite, a milestone in human history, a turning point that Homer and his friends could not miss, did not want to miss."
"1113","tt0132477","9047","5","Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds."
"1114","tt0132477","9047","6","Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack, even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity, and even then Homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams."
"1115","tt0132477","9047","7","But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough."
"1116","tt0132477","9047","8","Homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need."
"1117","tt0132477","9047","9","If he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship, because his friends gave him precedence, his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate, thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes."
"1118","tt0132477","9047","10","It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road."
"1119","tt0132477","9047","11","But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man, like mining or football."
"1120","tt0132477","9047","12","The working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father."
"1121","tt0132477","9047","13","If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day, the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap."
"1122","tt0132477","9047","14","Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think."
"1123","tt0132477","9047","15","This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face: the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father."
"1124","tt0132477","9047","16","Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"
"1125","tt0132477","9048","1","I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in theatres."
"1126","tt0132477","9048","2","""October Sky"" feels and looks oh so familiar."

"1128","tt0132477","9048","4","All plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films and possibly even better."
"1129","tt0132477","9048","5","But despite it's familiarity and resistance to all formulas Hollywood, this movie is winning and likeable at every turn."
"1130","tt0132477","9048","6","Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart, mind and soul."
"1131","tt0132477","9048","7","Just as the characters from Steven Sondheim's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation ""What do you call it."
"1132","tt0132477","9048","8","You call it a miracle."", Sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale."
"1133","tt0132477","9048","9","While jaded townsfolk of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines."
"1134","tt0132477","9048","10","Masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy Homer and his pals seem fresh and new."
"1135","tt0132477","9048","11","Especially affecting are subplots concerning Homer's ailing young school teacher."
"1136","tt0132477","9048","12","Remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship."
"1137","tt0132477","9048","13","Also remarkable is the father / son supblot that anchors the film."
"1138","tt0132477","9048","14","Perfectly played all around."
"1139","tt0132477","9048","15","Even Homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion."

"1143","tt0132477","9048","19","For once, I agree with them."
"1144","tt0132477","9048","20","You'll never look at the October sky quite the same again."
"1145","tt0132477","9049","1","There is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by Joe Johnston that goes something like this: ""The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right."""
"1146","tt0132477","9049","2","That is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual, which, in this movie, stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way."""
"1147","tt0132477","9049","3","October Sky"" is about a young man who believes in himself named Homer Hickam, growing up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950's."
"1148","tt0132477","9049","4","Homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner."

"1152","tt0132477","9049","8","This is something new for Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming."
"1153","tt0132477","9049","9","From this point on, his look at life will never be the same."
"1154","tt0132477","9049","10","First, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation."
"1155","tt0132477","9049","11","Flabbergasted at what he says, his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual His friends, however, think that this idea may have some potential."

"1157","tt0132477","9049","13","When the four friends start to test model rockets, and blow a white picket fence to smithereens, then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them, they're forced to end their progresses."
"1158","tt0132477","9049","14","The performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish."
"1159","tt0132477","9049","15","All of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here."
"1160","tt0132477","9049","16","Standing out in all of the glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley."
"1161","tt0132477","9049","17","This very well may be Academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released."
"1162","tt0132477","9049","18","The characters are also extremely well developed."
"1163","tt0132477","9049","19","Not only to the filmmakers give clear, apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry."
"1164","tt0132477","9049","20","We clearly understand all of the characters' motives and beliefs, especially the father, who is bent over on everlasting tradition."
"1165","tt0132477","9049","21","The film, unfortunately, loses some of its momentum at mid point because of a silly, recycled romantic sub plot involving Homer's love interest and how his brother stole her from him."
"1166","tt0132477","9049","22","This type of this is becoming so awfully common in high school movies, not that this film is aimed at high schoolers."
"1167","tt0132477","9049","23","The actors stare at each other mindlessly, like the are in a trance."
"1168","tt0132477","9049","24","I put up with it without complaining in 1997's ""Inventing the Abbots,"" but I have had just about enough this."
"1169","tt0132477","9049","25","But that is just a minor complaint."
"1170","tt0132477","9049","26","With an authentic looking time period, cinematography worth an Oscar and clips of the real life Homer and friends at the end, whom all hit it big with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of 1999."
"1171","tt0132477","9050","1","This is a gem, a real piece of Americana for all that this implies."
"1172","tt0132477","9050","2","If you are self programed to resist ""life afirming"" stories, just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe."
"1173","tt0132477","9050","3","And what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story, no need to nit pick what details were changed to make a compact story."
"1174","tt0132477","9050","4","Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and the complex, self conflicted, bottom line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight."
"1175","tt0132477","9050","5","The simple minded comments, refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off track, expose the limitation of the commentator, not the writers or the acting."
"1176","tt0132477","9050","6","This is not for the cynical, or the simple minded."
"1177","tt0132477","9051","1","I was watching this when my wife called to inquire from the other room as to my choice of fare."

"1180","tt0132477","9051","4","Though younger, but only by 5 years or so, than the ""Rocket Boys"" I remember the absolute urgency with which Sputnick was greeted by our administrators of education and how the whole Science Fair thing gained momentum and took me and others into the competitive whirlwind."
"1181","tt0132477","9051","5","My own tornado landed me in my own State's Science Fair, in Physics by '62, though our group was less successful in gaining the support of, for example, firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event, our city went so far as to allow us to tour the Nike missile site on Chicago's lakeshore."
"1182","tt0132477","9051","6","This movie brought it all back for me and I will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us ""UberNerds"" of the late '50s and early 60's."
"1183","tt0132477","9051","7","We are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country."
"1184","tt0132477","9051","8","See It!"
"1185","tt0132477","9052","1","This is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more hectic and loud films."
"1186","tt0132477","9052","2","It is another solid based on a true store, which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes."
"1187","tt0132477","9052","3","Frankly, I don't know but I liked the story."
"1188","tt0132477","9052","4","The story is about a young man back in the Fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else, including his father, does in this West Virginia town."
"1189","tt0132477","9052","5","The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, which I think was overdone."
"1190","tt0132477","9052","6","I would like to have a little less tension between the two."
"1191","tt0132477","9052","7","The young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first staring assignments, I think."
"1192","tt0132477","9052","8","He's likable, as are his school buddies in here."
"1193","tt0132477","9052","9","It's nice to see nice kids in a modern day film."
"1194","tt0132477","9052","10","The two other key actors in the movie are Chris Cooper the dad and Laura Dern the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time."
"1195","tt0132477","9052","11","The cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear."
"1196","tt0132477","9052","12","Once again: I wish there more of these kind of films made today."
"1197","tt0132477","9053","1","1."

"1199","tt0132477","9053","3","I watched it while I was in the town next to the one where he grew up!"
"1200","tt0132477","9053","4","I went and saw the buildings that the story took place in."
"1201","tt0132477","9053","5","Overall, I loved this movie, One of Jake Gyllenhaal's best!!"
"1202","tt0132477","9053","6","Also my favorite parts were the science fair, and all the times with his father."
"1203","tt0132477","9053","7","They were so sad, it seemed."
"1204","tt0132477","9053","8","Homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad didn't seem to care one way or another."

"1209","tt0132477","9053","13","Dress was accurate and they had their slang down too."
"1210","tt0132477","9053","14","Definitely recommend this movie!"
"1211","tt0132477","9054","1","""October Sky"" is a film that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid imagery, and lift your spirit."
"1212","tt0132477","9054","2","The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first, especially when the film is set in a mining town, where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine."
"1213","tt0132477","9054","3","But Homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps."
"1214","tt0132477","9054","4","With the encouragement of Miss Riley,a friendly teacher, members of his father's staff, and his friends, Homer attempts to make his dream a reality."
"1215","tt0132477","9054","5","Yet as in any true to life story, there are many stops along the way."
"1216","tt0132477","9054","6","Director Joe Johnston lowers us into the coal mines, where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock."
"1217","tt0132477","9054","7","With lit helmets and bent posture, they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness."
"1218","tt0132477","9054","8","The hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work."
"1219","tt0132477","9054","9","Contrasting the mine shaft's lugubrious load are the images of Homer and his friend's rocket launches."
"1220","tt0132477","9054","10","Underneath the blue bowl of sky, rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere..."
"1221","tt0132477","9054","11","And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time."
"1222","tt0132477","9054","12","Yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters."
"1223","tt0132477","9054","13","Homer's father is a classic hardened man...but he has a soft side as well."
"1224","tt0132477","9054","14","We see that he does love his son, despite their many arguments."
"1225","tt0132477","9054","15","The love and support of Miss Riley is evident as well."
"1226","tt0132477","9054","16","Best of all, the film is uncomfortable."
"1227","tt0132477","9054","17","It doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow."
"1228","tt0132477","9054","18","It tears at you, lifts you up."
"1229","tt0132477","9054","19","It keeps an air of reality, which is important in a film like this."
"1230","tt0132477","9054","20","This film can be considered a complete work."
"1231","tt0132477","9054","21","At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life."
"1232","tt0132477","9054","22","I didn't want it to end."
"1233","tt0132477","9054","23","Then I realized...that's what a good film does to a person."
"1234","tt0132477","9054","24","If it has done its job, you won't want it to end."
"1235","tt0132477","9054","25","And ""October Sky"" accomplishes just that."
"1236","tt0149151","10824","1","""Still Crazy"" is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time."
"1237","tt0149151","10824","2","It has been erroneously compared to ""This Is Spinal Tap"", which it has no relation to."
"1238","tt0149151","10824","3","""Spinal Tap"" is a satire and, quite frankly, not a very good one, in spite of it's ""outing"" of many rock clichés."
"1239","tt0149151","10824","4","Unlike ""Tap"", ""Still Crazy"" is populated by great actors, great songs and great human situations."
"1240","tt0149151","10824","5","You CARE about the people in ""Still Crazy""."
"1241","tt0149151","10824","6","That's all that matters."
"1242","tt0149151","10824","7","Oh, yeah, the music's pretty damn good, too, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze."
"1243","tt0149151","10824","8","American audiences were already familiar with Stephen Rea The Crying Game, but would only later become familiar with Bill Nighy Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II and Timothy Spall the Harry Potter movies."
"1244","tt0149151","10825","1","Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid hit rate as far as their TV work is concerned."
"1245","tt0149151","10825","2","However, their film work has been much more chequered 2008's The Bank Job was fine, the previous year's Across The Universe decidedly weak, for instance."
"1246","tt0149151","10825","3","Still Crazy, fortunately, is a solid success."
"1247","tt0149151","10825","4","It has a great story, excellent performances, a lot of humour, fabulous music and, above everything else, real heart."
"1248","tt0149151","10825","5","I savour ""moments"", and this film has one of them just when everything is going pear shaped at the festival reunion performance..."
"1249","tt0149151","10825","6","Hugely enjoyable."
"1250","tt0149151","10826","1","I have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm, happy feeling."
"1251","tt0149151","10826","2","I felt as if I had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time!"
"1252","tt0149151","10826","3","I thoroughly enjoyed this film."
"1253","tt0149151","10826","4","The acting was superb, although I would have to mention Bill Nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance."
"1254","tt0149151","10826","5","Bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films."
"1255","tt0149151","10826","6","Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance."
"1256","tt0149151","10826","7","And Billy Connolly, as always, totally gorgeous."
"1257","tt0149151","10826","8","It was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned."
"1258","tt0149151","10826","9","Such a refreshing experience to see a well written, superbly acted and good looking movie."
"1259","tt0149151","10827","1","Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash up R&R groups."
"1260","tt0149151","10827","2","Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison."
"1261","tt0149151","10827","3","Still Crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie."
"1262","tt0149151","10827","4","People who expect Spinal Tap like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light hearted nature of the movie, but I'd take a successful self ironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap."
"1263","tt0149151","10828","1","wonderful movie with good story great humour some great one liners and a soundtrack to die for.i've seen it 3 times so far.the american audiences are going to love it."
"1264","tt0149151","10829","1","I watched the movie in a preview and I really loved it."
"1265","tt0149151","10829","2","The cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious."
"1266","tt0149151","10829","3","Another highlight of the movie is definitely the music, which hopefully will be released soon."
"1267","tt0149151","10829","4","I recommend it to everyone who likes the British humour and especially to all musicians."
"1268","tt0149151","10829","5","Go and see."
"1269","tt0149151","10829","6","It's great."
"1270","tt0149151","10830","1","I enjoyed Still Crazy more than any film I have seen in years."
"1271","tt0149151","10830","2","A successful band from the 70's decide to give it another try."
"1272","tt0149151","10830","3","They start by playing some gigs in some seedy European venues, with hilarious results."
"1273","tt0149151","10830","4","The music is fantastic, the script and acting are terrific."
"1274","tt0149151","10830","5","The characters are spot on, especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice, makeup and personality problems."
"1275","tt0149151","10830","6","The concert at the end was unreal."
"1276","tt0149151","10830","7","Go and see it, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :"
"1277","tt0149151","10831","1","An excellent cast makes this movie work; all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it's clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie."
"1278","tt0149151","10831","2","It's not quite the comedy I expected, much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor."
"1279","tt0149151","10831","3","For music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny."
"1280","tt0149151","10831","4","I hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies, but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker films I can't help it: imagine if The Commitments actually did make it big and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later."
"1281","tt0149151","10832","1","If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy in this excellent movie with Stephen Rea in main role."
"1282","tt0149151","10832","2","The story is about the most famous rock group back there in 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again."
"1283","tt0149151","10832","3","But, of course, there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts."
"1284","tt0149151","10832","4","Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great, and song ""The Flame Still Burns"" is perfect."
"1285","tt0149151","10832","5","You have to watch it."
"1286","tt0149151","10833","1","This movie maked me cry at the end!"
"1287","tt0149151","10833","2","I watch at least 3 4 movies a week."
"1288","tt0149151","10833","3","I seen loads of great movies, even more crap ones."
"1289","tt0149151","10833","4","But when ending scene catharsic at it's core came I Cried!"
"1290","tt0149151","10833","5","And if you didn't you have serious problems!"
"1291","tt0149151","10833","6","The story is archetypal nothing new or original."
"1292","tt0149151","10833","7","But it's real because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist."
"1293","tt0149151","10833","8","Glam isn't my sort of music but I really admire all that they went through in early 70's..."
"1294","tt0149151","10833","9","At some point this directed me toward Velvet Goldmine!"
"1295","tt0149151","10833","10","Docudramas never really work very good."
"1296","tt0149151","10833","11","But this movie really meked us believe it all..."
"1297","tt0149151","10833","12","Because they don't try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts, present musicians that are superheroes, groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb, they don't glorify drugs and alcohol, they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even 20 years late..."
"1298","tt0149151","10833","13","Once again great movie."
"1299","tt0149151","10833","14","Since ""Leaving Las Vegas"" I was never so moved by a movie."
"1300","tt0149151","10834","1","I didn't approach ""Still Crazy"" with any real anticipation."
"1301","tt0149151","10834","2","Just another rock'n'roll picture, I figured... good nostalgia for the baby boomers."
"1302","tt0149151","10834","3","This film is partially that, but so much more."
"1303","tt0149151","10834","4","Brian Gibson, the director, previously helmed a biography of Tina Turner, and is quite successful in his style."
"1304","tt0149151","10834","5","I suppose it is fitting that this was his last film."
"1305","tt0149151","10834","6","The cast is well chosen."
"1306","tt0149151","10834","7","Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as the band's frontman."
"1307","tt0149151","10834","8","Actor turned director Bruce Robinson appears as the band's washed up guitarist."
"1308","tt0149151","10834","9","He does a superb job, even though he hasn't appeared on film since the late 70's."

"1310","tt0149151","10835","1","I love this movie."
"1311","tt0149151","10835","2","It is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging."
"1312","tt0149151","10835","3","Congratulations!!"
"1313","tt0149151","10835","4","I believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves."
"1314","tt0149151","10835","5","It is so eerie, you feel like you are watching a real life band."
"1315","tt0149151","10835","6","I would like to see more movies like this."
"1316","tt0149151","10835","7","I am glad that they did not choose famous Hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked."
"1317","tt0149151","10835","8","And even if Billy Connolly is quite well known, he really got stuck into the role and I could not imagine anybody else playing it."
"1318","tt0149151","10835","9","Congratulations again, I really believe this movie deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy."
"1319","tt0149151","10835","10","And when you get to the final scene..... well what can I say!!!!"
"1320","tt0149151","10836","1","I thought this movie was fantastic."
"1321","tt0149151","10836","2","It was hilarious."
"1322","tt0149151","10836","3","Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap."
"1323","tt0149151","10836","4","This is a must see for any fan of 70's rock."
"1324","tt0149151","10836","5","I hope me and my friends aren't like that in twenty years!"
"1325","tt0149151","10836","6","Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit,Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together, but not succeeding well."
"1326","tt0149151","10836","7","If you love music, and were ever in a band, this movie is definitely for you."
"1327","tt0149151","10836","8","You won't regret seeing this movie."
"1328","tt0149151","10836","9","I know I don't."
"1329","tt0149151","10836","10","Even my family found it funny, and that's saying something."
"1330","tt0149151","10837","1","As an aging rocker, this movie mentions Heep and Quo my 2 favourite bands ever but with the incredible cast everyone and the fantastic storyline I just love this piece of creative genius."
"1331","tt0149151","10837","2","I cannot recommend it more highly and Mick Jones added so much Foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever Lou Gramm I have watched this great work more than 10 times Bill Nighy what a voice and Jimmy Nail talent oozes from every pore then Astrid.... and Karen..... what more could an aging rocker ask for!!"
"1332","tt0149151","10837","3","10/10 bloody brilliant."
"1333","tt0149151","10837","4","Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, Originally from Windsor, England."
"1334","tt0149151","10838","1","I agree with what ""veinbreaker"" wrote with regards to the ""Ahhhh"" feeling you get at the end of this movie."
"1335","tt0149151","10838","2","I absolutely loved the locations they chose to film, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic sounding track on which Hans Matheson sings."
"1336","tt0149151","10838","3","It's trippy."
"1337","tt0149151","10838","4","Nighy was fab in his role, Nail ""nailed"" it, Beano was the typical drummer, and Rea kept it together."
"1338","tt0149151","10838","5","Bruce Robinson was awesome."
"1339","tt0149151","10838","6","Helena was a lovely girlfriend."
"1340","tt0149151","10838","7","But I felt Juliet Aubrey's performance was gorgeous."
"1341","tt0149151","10838","8","The scenes between Aubrey & Robinson killed me!"
"1342","tt0149151","10838","9","Perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on!"
"1343","tt0149151","10838","10","Too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out!"
"1344","tt0149151","10838","11","They ought to!"
"1345","tt0149151","10838","12","I've told all my musician friends. great quote by Jimmy Nail's character: ""it's supposed to be rock & roll, not the Phantom of the fg opera!"""
"1346","tt0149151","10839","1","I spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it."
"1347","tt0149151","10839","2","My husband and I enjoyed it so much we bought the VHS and have enjoyed it ever since."
"1348","tt0149151","10839","3","The plot has been well discussed, so no need in going over it again."
"1349","tt0149151","10839","4","The point is this movie deserves repeated viewings."
"1350","tt0149151","10839","5","Americans, especially, aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around."
"1351","tt0149151","10839","6","I know I didn't."
"1352","tt0149151","10839","7","This movie is funny, touching, sad all at the same time."
"1353","tt0149151","10839","8","When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding, it's cringe inducing."
"1354","tt0149151","10839","9","When Karen calls Tony ""Brian"" as he attempts to kiss her, it's heartbreaking."
"1355","tt0149151","10839","10","When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it's too funny for words."
"1356","tt0149151","10839","11","And the music: it's as good as any movie soundtrack I've heard in years."
"1357","tt0149151","10839","12","I was dancing in the living room to ""All Over the World."""
"1358","tt0149151","10839","13","Every performance is absolutely perfect."
"1359","tt0149151","10839","14","Bill Nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips."
"1360","tt0149151","10839","15","Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years."
"1361","tt0149151","10839","16","He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him."
"1362","tt0149151","10839","17","But all the actors are equally brilliant."
"1363","tt0149151","10839","18","Ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it."
"1364","tt0149151","10839","19","It's a gem."
"1365","tt0149151","10840","1","In the voice over which begins the film, HughieBilly Connolly, a roadie for the great 70's band Strange Fruit, said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop Strange Fruit's set was that God was sick of 70's excess."
"1366","tt0149151","10840","2","Indeed, it's been popular to put down that era of music, and see punk as a welcome antidote to it."
"1367","tt0149151","10840","3","While I agree the excess was tiresomeas well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it, and like punk, I still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock, and this film about Strange Fruit's long, strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days."
"1368","tt0149151","10840","4","One of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes."
"1369","tt0149151","10840","5","Brian Gibson directed WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, about Tina Turnerwhile I had problems with the dramatic parts of the film, the music was handled very well, writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais co wrote THE COMMITMENTS and were behind the music oriented British TV show OVER THE RAINBOW, and the songs Strange Fruit played were co written by Foreigner's Mick Jonesnot to be confused with The Clash's Mick Jones, so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about."
"1370","tt0149151","10840","6","Also, two cast members are musicians in their own rightBill Nye I don't know about, though the film credits him with his own singing, and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era, while Jimmy Nail was in another British TV show which was music oriented, though I forget the name, and he was in EVITA, and the others are convincing at it."
"1371","tt0149151","10840","7","And while, as I said, a lot of 70's bands like Strange Fruit behaved badly towards women, the movie doesn't make the same mistakeexcept for the woman who follows Timothy Spall around; as the manager of the reunion, Juliet Aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded character."
"1372","tt0149151","10840","8","The other actors are all good as well, with special praise to Stephen Rea, who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality."
"1373","tt0149151","10840","9","There are a couple of plot points which don't work, but overall this is quite enjoyable."
"1374","tt0149151","10840","10","Oh yeah, and the music is good too."
"1375","tt0149151","10841","1","If you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening, this is the film for you!"
"1376","tt0149151","10841","2","Excellent script and perfectly cast actors."
"1377","tt0149151","10841","3","I especially loved Ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs inspired!"
"1378","tt0149151","10842","1","So I rented ""Still Crazy"" instead."
"1379","tt0149151","10842","2","When I described Hardcore Logo to the guy at the video store, he said that sounded kind of like Still Crazy."
"1380","tt0149151","10842","3","So I rented it."
"1381","tt0149151","10842","4","Was I disappointed."
"1382","tt0149151","10842","5","Well, yes, as Still Crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band, but that's OK."
"1383","tt0149151","10842","6","Still Crazy tells the story of the Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival."
"1384","tt0149151","10842","7","Twenty years later, the band members are all struggling to make a living, and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival."
"1385","tt0149151","10842","8","They take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis, touring Europe in the process."
"1386","tt0149151","10842","9","Some quite funny hijinks ensue, and all the characters go through subtle changes."
"1387","tt0149151","10842","10","Watching this movie, you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant."
"1388","tt0149151","10842","11","And that's not bad at all."
"1389","tt0149151","10843","1","What happens to washed up rock n roll stars in the late 1990's."
"1390","tt0149151","10843","2","They launch a comeback / reunion tour."
"1391","tt0149151","10843","3","At least, that's what the members of Strange Fruit, a fictional 70's stadium rock group do."
"1392","tt0149151","10843","4","Tony Stephen Rea has the concession on condom vending machines when he runs into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival."
"1393","tt0149151","10843","5","It was at that festival in the 70's that Strange Fruit broke up."
"1394","tt0149151","10843","6","The 70's are ""retro"" and the time is right to wide that wave."
"1395","tt0149151","10843","7","He sets off in search of the other members of the band."
"1396","tt0149151","10843","8","Part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of Keith, the lead singer and brilliant song writer."
"1397","tt0149151","10843","9","The band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came."
"1398","tt0149151","10843","10","Beano, the drummer, played by Timothy Spall who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies is a layabout, the bass player is a roofer, and their lead singer is still a rocker."
"1399","tt0149151","10843","11","While he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it, as his fortune has not lasted."
"1400","tt0149151","10843","12","Brian, the lead guitarist, is dead, so a young guitarist is hired to replace him."
"1401","tt0149151","10843","13","Somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try."
"1402","tt0149151","10843","14","Abandoning their day jobs, they begin to rehearse, and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums."
"1403","tt0149151","10843","15","But he wants them to start touring again first."
"1404","tt0149151","10843","16","And so they hit the club circuit around Europe."
"1405","tt0149151","10843","17","The club scene is not kind to these overweight, dated, old rockers."
"1406","tt0149151","10843","18","It is on tour that the film really starts to develop."
"1407","tt0149151","10843","19","All of the old conflicts rearise, with the figures of Keith and Brian hovering throughout."
"1408","tt0149151","10843","20","They all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier."
"1409","tt0149151","10843","21","And they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable."
"1410","tt0149151","10843","22","Still Crazy starts as Spinal Tap II but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film, following the relationships of the band members."
"1411","tt0149151","10843","23","While it is still a very funny movie, it is the evolving characters, struggling to deal with the deaths of Brian and Keith and with their own personal demons, that make the film work."
"1412","tt0149151","10844","1","This reminded me of Spinal Tap, on a more serious level."
"1413","tt0149151","10844","2","It's the story of a band doing a reunion tour, but things are not harmonious between them."
"1414","tt0149151","10844","3","I was especially impressed with the performance of Bill Nighy as Ray."
"1415","tt0149151","10844","4","You felt sorry for him, yet he had a certain creepiness about him."
"1416","tt0149151","10844","5","It's a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band get wrinkly,old and pathetic."
"1417","tt0149151","10844","6","Bittersweet, highly recommended.."
"1418","tt0149151","10845","1","> Contrary to most reviews I've read, I didn't feel this followed any of the other rock movies ""Spinal Tap"", etc."
"1419","tt0149151","10845","2","The story was more unique, although I feel most people wanted to see the ""sex, drugs & rock and roll"" vices that the band kept alluding to."
"1420","tt0149151","10845","3","> As an American, I knew a few of the actors Spall, Connelly & Rea."
"1421","tt0149151","10845","4","Surprised to find out ""Brian""/Bruce Robinson was in Zifferedi's <sp. classic ""Romeo & Juliet""."
"1422","tt0149151","10845","5","Guess I'll have to rent that next."
"1423","tt0149151","10845","6","> ""THE FLAME STILL BURNS"" My wife, who hails from Mexico, didn't follow the English/British language too well, missed some of the jokes which I dutifully explained but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene."
"1424","tt0149151","10845","7","She loves the song so much now."
"1425","tt0149151","10845","8","> Funny that Amazon.com has the soundtrack for $30+usd when I bought the DVD in the bargain bin at Wal Mart for $5.50usd."
"1426","tt0149151","10845","9","Price non withstanding, I first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since."
"1427","tt0149151","10846","1","The funky, yet strictly second tier British glam rock band Strange Fruit breaks up at the end of the wild'n'wacky excess ridden 70's."
"1428","tt0149151","10846","2","The individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90's: morose keyboardist Stephen Rea winds up penniless and down on his luck, vain, neurotic, pretentious lead singer Bill Nighy tries and fails to pursue a floundering solo career, paranoid drummer Timothy Spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt, and surly bass player Jimmy Nail installs roofs for a living."
"1429","tt0149151","10846","3","Former loving groupie turned patient, understanding, long suffering manager Juliet Aubrey gets the group back together for an ill advised, largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of Europe."
"1430","tt0149151","10846","4","Our lovably ragged bunch try gamely, but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day."
"1431","tt0149151","10846","5","Scraggly zonked out roadie Billy Connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist Hans Matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy, trouble plagued, but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride."
"1432","tt0149151","10846","6","Director Brian Gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud, ringing, flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock in general, this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big hearted charm and tireless verve."
"1433","tt0149151","10846","7","The astute, sharply written script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais likewise bristles with spot on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity, capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow."
"1434","tt0149151","10846","8","Ashley Rowe's lovely, elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right on rockin' flair and aplomb."
"1435","tt0149151","10846","9","Kudos also to the across the board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt out soul and tattered, but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success."
"1436","tt0149151","10846","10","All in all, this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the 90's."
"1437","tt0149151","10847","1","I'm 60 years old, a guitarist, lead/rhythm, and over the last forty years, I've been in four bands, it's all there, the fights, the foul ups, the rotten food, the worse accommodation, always travelling, little or no money, and every one was drunk or high."
"1438","tt0149151","10847","2","But, the clubs, the fans, and the music, made it all worth it!"
"1439","tt0149151","10847","3","Just like Strange Fruit!"
"1440","tt0149151","10847","4","I'm too damn old for it now, and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking, but for the length of that video, it all came back, and it was all there!"
"1441","tt0149151","10847","5","The birds, the brawls, and the booze!"
"1442","tt0149151","10847","6","And I was young again!"
"1443","tt0149151","10847","7","It's just like Billy Connolly's voice over, God likes that 70's stuff!"
"1444","tt0149151","10847","8","Rock On Forever!"
"1445","tt0149151","10848","1","..."
"1446","tt0149151","10848","2","Heads, Hands, and Feet a band from the past, just like Strange Fruit."
"1447","tt0149151","10848","3","A triple whammy there."
"1448","tt0149151","10848","4","Those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under 40, and have had no experience of the real thing."
"1449","tt0149151","10848","5","Sad for them."
"1450","tt0149151","10848","6","This is an achingly well observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two, and will probably not even fade much on the second showing."
"1451","tt0149151","10848","7","Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as the fat drummer in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all, and Bill Nighy a new name for me as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances, and Juliet Aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as Karen, who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self destruct."
"1452","tt0149151","10848","8","The Syd Barrett/Brian Wilson echoes are loud and clear, Mott the Hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness, and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute."
"1453","tt0149151","10848","9","Don't compare this with Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty it's unfair on all of them."
"1454","tt0149151","10848","10","The nearest comparison is The Commitments, and that's no bad thing."
"1455","tt0149151","10848","11","And any film that can conjure up memories of Blodwyn Pig a band I do not remember ever seeing, but the name lives on well, it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about."
"1456","tt0149151","10848","12","A small delight, and thanks for the memory."
"1457","tt0149151","10848","13","Oh... and I've got ANOTHER one Stiff Little Fingers; a a and what about SteelEYE Span..."
"1458","tt0149151","10848","14","Spooky TOOTH..."
"1459","tt0149151","10848","15","Ten Inch NAILS anyone."
"1460","tt0149151","10848","16","You have to see the movie or have been on the road"
"1461","tt0149151","10849","1","This is perhaps the best rockumentary ever a British, better This Is Spinal Tap."
"1462","tt0149151","10849","2","The characters are believable, the plot is great, and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events such as Ray's problem with fitting in the band."
"1463","tt0149151","10849","3","The soundtrack is excellent."
"1464","tt0149151","10849","4","Real period stuff, even if it is in the same key, you'll be humming some of the songs for days."
"1465","tt0149151","10849","5","What I liked was the nearly all British cast, with some of the favourite household names."
"1466","tt0149151","10849","6","Ray's wife is priceless..."
"1467","tt0149151","10849","7","The film never drags, it just goes at the right pace, and has some genuinely funny sections in it."
"1468","tt0149151","10849","8","A generator of some really good catchphrases!"
"1469","tt0149151","10849","9","It's a hidden diamond."
"1470","tt0149151","10850","1","What a good movie!"
"1471","tt0149151","10850","2","At last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock: illusions of fame."
"1472","tt0149151","10850","3","Well known Rockers are getting old and forgotten, not the music."
"1473","tt0149151","10850","4","And with a good sense of humour."
"1474","tt0149151","10850","5","Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock."
"1475","tt0149151","10850","6","Anyway, Still Crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll I have ever seen."
"1476","tt0149151","10850","7","Far much better than Spinal Tap for instance."
"1477","tt0149151","10850","8","Why."
"1478","tt0149151","10850","9","Because in Still Crazy, people are mature."
"1479","tt0149151","10850","10","They have a different point of view about rock, about love and about life."
"1480","tt0149151","10850","11","They want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much."
"1481","tt0149151","10850","12","Beyond the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams."
"1482","tt0149151","10850","13","Like anyone of us."
"1483","tt0149151","10850","14","Spend a good time watching this listen to the awesome soundtrack!"
"1484","tt0149151","10850","15","and finally thinking of your own future."
"1485","tt0149151","10850","16","Bye!"
"1486","tt0149151","10851","1","I found 'Still Crazy' to be marvelously entertaining, and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late '60s, early '70s rock."
"1487","tt0149151","10851","2","My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD don't worry, it's only been three times and she loves it too."
"1488","tt0149151","10851","3","It is a truly loving, poignant and hilarious nod to the era, and every actor hits his/her notes with perfection."
"1489","tt0149151","10851","4","It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad his somewhat similar turn in 'Love Actually' brought him more attention."
"1490","tt0149151","10851","5","Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian, bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug damaged rocker stereotype."
"1491","tt0149151","10851","6","It was interesting to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer."
"1492","tt0149151","10851","7","I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into Billy Connolly at the local mall he lived here at the time and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time."
"1493","tt0149151","10851","8","He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time."
"1494","tt0149151","10851","9","We even talked of the idea of an American oriented remake before wisely dismissing that."
"1495","tt0149151","10851","10","Why mess with the original."
"1496","tt0149151","10851","11","My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it wasn't hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience."
"1497","tt0149151","10852","1","Hello, I was alanrickmaniac."
"1498","tt0149151","10852","2","I'm a Still Crazy holic."
"1499","tt0149151","10852","3","It was just another movie I watched partly on TV."
"1500","tt0149151","10852","4","Then I had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends."
"1501","tt0149151","10852","5","Then I wanted the DVD, because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks."
"1502","tt0149151","10852","6","After the DVD I had to lay my hands on the soundtrack."
"1503","tt0149151","10852","7","Then on several film posters and the film script."
"1504","tt0149151","10852","8","Right now it has become that worse that I try to push other people into addiction with my website and Still Crazy parties."
"1505","tt0149151","10852","9","How could that happen."
"1506","tt0149151","10852","10","What drove me into addiction."
"1507","tt0149151","10852","11","OK, it's one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the British can produce."
"1508","tt0149151","10852","12","Alright, the movie is worlds apart from stuff like ''This Is Spinal Tap'', because of the characters, that aren't childish or ultra cool, but real."
"1509","tt0149151","10852","13","This is a story about men getting older, too."
"1510","tt0149151","10852","14","A story about men getting along with each other."
"1511","tt0149151","10852","15","Or don't."
"1512","tt0149151","10852","16","It contains some of the best actors possible."
"1513","tt0149151","10852","17","Tim Spall."
"1514","tt0149151","10852","18","Stephen Rea."
"1515","tt0149151","10852","19","Bruce Robinson."
"1516","tt0149151","10852","20","Jimmy Nail."
"1517","tt0149151","10852","21","And Bill Nighy."
"1518","tt0149151","10852","22","Bill Nighy who puts on one of the best performances I've ever seen in a film."
"1519","tt0149151","10852","23","Good, the soundtrack is unbelievable."
"1520","tt0149151","10852","24","Foreigner's Mick Jones has written the songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit."
"1521","tt0149151","10852","25","Jimmy Nail who plays bass man Les Wickes and Bill Nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer Ray Simms are really singing."
"1522","tt0149151","10852","26","We know that about Jimmy Nail, but if you've only heard Bill Nighy's singing in ""Love Actually"", you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is."
"1523","tt0149151","10852","27","Well, you'll fever for every scene to come for the x th time, especially those concert scenes."
"1524","tt0149151","10852","28","You'd die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when Strange Fruit is doing ""All Over The World"", singing on the top of your lungs."
"1525","tt0149151","10852","29","You long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real Strange Fruit at Wisbech's festival stage."
"1526","tt0149151","10852","30","It's hard but..."
"1527","tt0149151","10852","31","I'm addicted to this film."
"1528","tt0149151","10852","32","I'm addicted to Strange Fruit."
"1529","tt0149151","10852","33","If there's a world where this band really exists I'd like to move there."
"1530","tt0149151","10852","34","Got Still Crazy... anyone."
"1531","tt0149151","10853","1","This movie is tremendous for uplifting the Spirits."
"1532","tt0149151","10853","2","Every time I watch it, I see & hear funny little things that I missed before."
"1533","tt0149151","10853","3","The soundtrack is unbelievable."
"1534","tt0149151","10853","4","Mick Jones Foreigner and Chris Difford Squeeze penned the songs, making Strange Fruit the best thing that ever hit today's music scene."
"1535","tt0149151","10853","5","Unfortunately, Strange Fruit are a strictly fictitional washed up '60's to 70's band that were never good to begin with, due to drug use and inner fighting."
"1536","tt0149151","10853","6","One wonders what might have been, while listening to their fanatstic soundtrack."
"1537","tt0149151","10853","7","The Fruit draw inspiration from The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie, and The Who."
"1538","tt0149151","10853","8","Each member of Fruit are quite memorable."
"1539","tt0149151","10853","9","Stephen Rea stars as down and dead broke Tony Costello, who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour, with hopes of reaping monetary benefits."
"1540","tt0149151","10853","10","Costello haply approaches ex roadie Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past."
"1541","tt0149151","10853","11","Juliet gathers up the bitter Jimmy Nail Les Wickes, blundering Timothy Spall David 'Beano' Baggot, and extravagantly glamouresque Ray Simms Bill Nighy."
"1542","tt0149151","10853","12","Tumbling in is another ex roadie, the hippy toker jokester Hughie Billy Connolly, who never let the flame burn out."
"1543","tt0149151","10853","13","As Juliet searches for the last member of their motley band, the elusive guitarist songwriter Brian Lovell played by the brooding Bruce Robinson, the reunited members squabble, just like old times, fighting over each others' rusty talent."
"1544","tt0149151","10853","14","The band is then given the chance to do a small Dutch tour, to prepare for the festival."
"1545","tt0149151","10853","15","With young Hendrix like Luke Shand Hans Matheson taking the place of Lovell, the crew hits the road."
"1546","tt0149151","10853","16","The sparks fly as their memories flame forward, threatening to burn their unfinished goals..."
"1547","tt0149151","10853","17","Be prepared to laugh, sing, cheer, and cry, as these memorable characters etch themselves back into your hearts..."
"1548","tt0166896","4771","1","The zenith of two brilliant careers."
"1549","tt0166896","4771","2","David Lynch, better known for less accessible material, crafts a delicate and exquisite story around the most unlikely premise."
"1550","tt0166896","4771","3","A man travels to see his estranged brother."
"1551","tt0166896","4771","4","Having no other means of transportation, his journey takes him over six weeks on a lawn mower."
"1552","tt0166896","4771","5","Richard Farnsworth, in his last film, delivers a stunningly layered and nuanced performance in the starring role."
"1553","tt0166896","4771","6","Achingly beautiful in its exultation of small things, Straight Story is a classic cinema experience that must not be missed."
"1554","tt0166896","4771","7","Sissy Spacek is notable as Farnsworth's daughter, an impaired middle aged woman living with the loss of her children."
"1555","tt0166896","4772","1","This movie is maybe the most touching and uplifting one that I have ever seen."
"1556","tt0166896","4772","2","I am not a religious person, but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience."
"1557","tt0166896","4772","3","One suddenly realizes that there is really meaning to life."
"1558","tt0166896","4772","4","I must admit that when I first heard about this movie I was sceptical."
"1559","tt0166896","4772","5","I thought the plot sounded contrived and I was afraid that the story would be banal."
"1560","tt0166896","4772","6","But being a David Lynch fan I decided to give it a go."
"1561","tt0166896","4772","7","It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie, but then I was completely lost in it."
"1562","tt0166896","4772","8","There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie!"
"1563","tt0166896","4772","9","I left the cinema feeling that I had truly learned something valuable about life."
"1564","tt0166896","4772","10","This is not a typical David Lynch movie, and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years."
"1565","tt0166896","4772","11","On the other hand, I am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and profound human insight because I also thought he managed that very well in The Elephant Man."
"1566","tt0166896","4772","12","Lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and I think The Straight Story is his best yet."
"1567","tt0166896","4772","13","9.5/10"
"1568","tt0166896","4773","1","Lovely piece of good cinema."
"1569","tt0166896","4773","2","This is one of those films that you see smiling and you do not know why."
"1570","tt0166896","4773","3","Well, one of the reasons could be that we are before one of the most surprising directors today, and he is able to film emotions."
"1571","tt0166896","4773","4","When you are watching the film you can feel what Mr."
"1572","tt0166896","4773","5","Straight was feeling when he took the decision to go to visit his brother with his ""marvellous"" John Deere."
"1573","tt0166896","4773","6","What changed in his mind., what changed in YOUR mind when you watched this film."
"1574","tt0166896","4773","7","A beautiful fraternal love story."
"1575","tt0166896","4774","1","This, I think, is one of the best pictures ever made."
"1576","tt0166896","4774","2","It's so pure and beautiful."
"1577","tt0166896","4774","3","It really touched me."
"1578","tt0166896","4774","4","I'm glad David Lynch proved that a film doesn't necessarily need SFX, a twisting, complicated plot or flashy images."
"1579","tt0166896","4774","5","Way to go,Dave."
"1580","tt0166896","4774","6","I'd like to see Cronenberg do that!"
"1581","tt0166896","4775","1","If it's action and adventure you want in a movie, then you'd be best advised to look elsewhere."
"1582","tt0166896","4775","2","On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood, check out ""The Straight Story."""
"1583","tt0166896","4775","3","Richard Farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly Alvin Straight, in this true story of Alvin's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke."
"1584","tt0166896","4775","4","Farnsworth is perfect in this role, as he travels his long and winding road, making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way."
"1585","tt0166896","4775","5","The story moves along as slowly as the riding mower, but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching, waiting for the next life lesson Alvin's going to offer."
"1586","tt0166896","4775","6","Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy."
"1587","tt0166896","4775","7","It's the only way to watch this very good movie, which rates a 7/10 in my book."
"1588","tt0166896","4776","1","I was watching this movie at one of my usual time, which is real real late at night."
"1589","tt0166896","4776","2","Usually if a movie doesn't interest me, I start falling asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay awake."
"1590","tt0166896","4776","3","At first I thought that's what I had to do since this movie's pacing started off slow, along with the fact that its shots tended to linger with the character for a long time."
"1591","tt0166896","4776","4","But after a bit, I start getting more into the movie, as more is revealed about the main character through his story telling."
"1592","tt0166896","4776","5","By the end, you feel like you've known him your whole life."
"1593","tt0166896","4776","6","The movie kept my interest so much that I didn't even know the sun was about to rise."
"1594","tt0166896","4776","7","Not much of Lynch's bizzare style, but there is enough of quirky characters to make the film amusing."
"1595","tt0166896","4777","1","Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's works is his most accessible."
"1596","tt0166896","4777","2","This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares, Lynch provides a reflective, fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both."
"1597","tt0166896","4777","3","The simple true story of an Iowa farmer Richard Farnsworth who rides a lawn mower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged, stricken brother, there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland, filmed by veteran cinematographer Freddy Francis to make it an undeniable Lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable."
"1598","tt0166896","4777","4","Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way, allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by John Roach and Mary Sweeney but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances, one of the most notable being Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time."
"1599","tt0166896","4777","5","But that's vintage Lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best."
"1600","tt0166896","4777","6","To those unfamiliar with Lynch or know him only by his violent, disturbing reputation, this is an excellent place to begin; for those who know his work, this is one of the finest in his repertoire."
"1601","tt0166896","4778","1","Like his early masterpiece ""The Elephant Man"" Lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight, simple story without losing his artistic touch."
"1602","tt0166896","4778","2","This is a true story of an elderly retired man expertly played by Richard Farnsworth who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at death's door."
"1603","tt0166896","4778","3","A beautiful score from Badalamenti, exquisite photography of rural life love those aerial corn field shots, and a sly director's hand that reveals man's basic humanity, this is a beautiful slice of life film."
"1604","tt0166896","4778","4","Its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep, but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end."
"1605","tt0166896","4779","1","On paper, this movie would sound incredibly boring."
"1606","tt0166896","4779","2","The idea of a 75 year old man traveling the country side on a riding mower certainly doesn't have much appeal to it, but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence."
"1607","tt0166896","4779","3","Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than ""The Straight Story."""
"1608","tt0166896","4779","4","The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenage girl."
"1609","tt0166896","4779","5","She's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out."
"1610","tt0166896","4779","6","Alvin tells her a story about his own kids, long ago."
"1611","tt0166896","4779","7","He had them each take a stick and break it, which they could easily do."
"1612","tt0166896","4779","8","Then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them."
"1613","tt0166896","4779","9","""That bundle,"" he said, ""is family."""
"1614","tt0166896","4779","10","So many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger."
"1615","tt0166896","4779","11","""The Straight Story"" realizes that we're smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions."
"1616","tt0166896","4779","12","Alvin's journey across Iowa is full of such refreshingly un Hollywood character interactions."
"1617","tt0166896","4779","13","Each interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can't help but smile as he makes his way to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke."
"1618","tt0166896","4779","14","And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey."
"1619","tt0166896","4779","15","It's a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets to their benefit and ours."
"1620","tt0166896","4779","16","It's a slow, simple, relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we've lost with the urbanization of America."""
"1621","tt0166896","4779","17","The Straight Story"" is the rare live action ""G"" rated movie that truly should not be missed."
"1622","tt0166896","4779","18","Grade: A"
"1623","tt0166896","4780","1","Always fancied this film from the video cover."
"1624","tt0166896","4780","2","Eventually got round to buying it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film."
"1625","tt0166896","4780","3","A simply stunning performance from all of the case and it's filmed so beautifully."
"1626","tt0166896","4780","4","Even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is, as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale."
"1627","tt0166896","4780","5","It's really moving, frequently amusing and very watchable."
"1628","tt0166896","4780","6","Not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout."
"1629","tt0166896","4780","7","A 9/10 from me."
"1630","tt0166896","4780","8","A must see."
"1631","tt0166896","4781","1","MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch."
"1632","tt0166896","4781","2","He's a modern genius, because he's not only a film maker."
"1633","tt0166896","4781","3","His stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen."
"1634","tt0166896","4781","4","So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise to me, with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets."
"1635","tt0166896","4781","5","Still, Lynch is there, and, while this is far from his best, it's a film not to be missed."
"1636","tt0166896","4781","6","Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons.8/10"
"1637","tt0166896","4782","1","Well, it definitely is unlike anything else directed by Lynch."
"1638","tt0166896","4782","2","No supernatural stuff, no violence, no profanity."
"1639","tt0166896","4782","3","Nevertheless, it is a beautiful flick."
"1640","tt0166896","4782","4","It's a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because it's the story of an old man's 6 weekthat's my best guess for its duration journey."
"1641","tt0166896","4782","5","The characters are everyday people and thus, they are believable."
"1642","tt0166896","4782","6","The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching."
"1643","tt0166896","4782","7","Everyone who has a sibling can relate to it."

"1646","tt0166896","4783","1","""The Straight Story"" is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named Alvin Straight, who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his estranged, dying brother."
"1647","tt0166896","4783","2","But that's just the basic synapsis...this movie is about so much more than that."
"1648","tt0166896","4783","3","This was Richard's Farnworth's last role before he died, and it's definitely one that he will be remembered for."
"1649","tt0166896","4783","4","He's a stubborn old man, not unlike a lot of the old men that you and I probably know."
"1650","tt0166896","4783","5","""The Straight Story"" is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives."
"1651","tt0166896","4783","6","It will reach down and touch some part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will."
"1652","tt0166896","4784","1","It's nice to see a film with real people with honest feelings."
"1653","tt0166896","4784","2","Sissy Spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple, yet nice, daughter to Robert Farnsworth,who finally, in his last role, gets to show what a fine actor he was."
"1654","tt0166896","4784","3","It is hard to believe that this is a David Lynch film."
"1655","tt0166896","4784","4","It is slow and even, sweet and moving."
"1656","tt0166896","4784","5","One of the best unless you like car chases, sex scenes, and violence."
"1","tt0166896","4787","1","David Lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles put together the wrong way."
"2","tt0166896","4787","2","They are interesting to look at and think about but they really don't gel in your mind."
"3","tt0166896","4787","3","Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator."

"10","tt0166896","4787","10","At the heart of this film is sweet voiced Richard Farnsworth."
"11","tt0166896","4787","11","He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way."
"12","tt0166896","4787","12","The fact that the film is slow paced matches Alvin's slow journey toward realization."
"13","tt0166896","4787","13","Along the way Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl."
"14","tt0166896","4787","14","She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation."
"15","tt0166896","4787","15","After listening to Alvin speak about family she reconsiders."
"16","tt0166896","4787","16","Later Alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car."
"17","tt0166896","4787","17","She complains that she has killed several and leaves."
"18","tt0166896","4787","18","Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night."
"19","tt0166896","4787","19","Later Alvin's lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him."
"20","tt0166896","4787","20","A nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed."
"21","tt0166896","4787","21","They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past."
"22","tt0166896","4787","22","Alvin insists on paying for the call."
"23","tt0166896","4787","23","The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure."
"24","tt0166896","4787","24","Alvin declines with thanks."
"25","tt0166896","4787","25","While Alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls."
"26","tt0166896","4787","26","Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him."
"27","tt0166896","4787","27","Alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who've repaired his lawn mower."
"28","tt0166896","4787","28","He talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs."
"29","tt0166896","4787","29","He even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother."
"30","tt0166896","4787","30","The night before Alvin leaves the man's yard he takes his hat off to him."
"31","tt0166896","4787","31","The man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks Alvin to write to him."
"32","tt0166896","4787","32","This scene is perfect in it's simplicity."
"33","tt0166896","4787","33","It's heartfelt because it's so straight, so real."
"34","tt0166896","4787","34","The journey continues and we can't help to get more and more involved with it."
"35","tt0166896","4787","35","We want Alvin to get to his brothers."
"36","tt0166896","4787","36","We want him to make amends."
"37","tt0166896","4787","37","We want to know this world is full of forgiveness."
"38","tt0166896","4787","38","This was Richard Farnsworth at his best."
"39","tt0166896","4787","39","It was his last film and his performance was amazing."
"40","tt0166896","4787","40","You can't help but to understand his pride, to listen to his wisdom, and to ultimately feel his pain."

"42","tt0166896","4787","42","If there's justice in the afterlife then Alvin Straight, his brother, and Richard Farnsworth are together sitting at a bar."
"43","tt0166896","4787","43","I can picture them discussing their lives, regrets, hopes, and joys."
"44","tt0166896","4787","44","As Alvin says in the film, ""My brother and I used to look up at the stars."""
"45","tt0166896","4787","45","Well, I know they all are with the best view in the house."
"46","tt0166896","4788","1","This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen: I glowed inside throughout the whole film."
"47","tt0166896","4788","2","The music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen."
"48","tt0166896","4788","3","The slow pace was set by the mode of travel a riding lawn mower with a big trailer and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow paced lives of the other characters."
"49","tt0166896","4788","4","The story actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76."
"50","tt0166896","4788","5","There was no acting; everything was completely real, as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters."
"51","tt0166896","4788","6","Sissy Spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead, always wanting to do the right thing."
"52","tt0166896","4788","7","Richard Farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across Iowa to visit his estranged brother, Lyle, who has had a stroke."
"53","tt0166896","4788","8","Alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way."
"54","tt0166896","4788","9","The film underscores the importance of family to this man and, hopefully, to all of us."
"55","tt0166896","4788","10","I eagerly anticipate seeing it again, and again."
"56","tt0166896","4788","11","Directed by David Lynch, this films proves his directorial skill."
"57","tt0166896","4788","12","Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; at 79, he was the oldest nominee ever for that award."
"58","tt0166896","4789","1","David Lynch's 1999 film of John Roach / Mary Sweeney's story is set in Iowa and Wisconsin some time well before the film's eventual release."
"59","tt0166896","4789","2","We come into the life of Alvin Straight Richard Farnsworth late on in life."
"60","tt0166896","4789","3","His medical condition is poor, his life is mostly behind him and he knows it."
"61","tt0166896","4789","4","This makes what he decides to do, even more remarkable and endearing."
"62","tt0166896","4789","5","He decides and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions to put a few things straight."
"63","tt0166896","4789","6","Alvin is, by this time in his life, a man of great experience but modest means."
"64","tt0166896","4789","7","His daughter Rose Sissy Spacek struggles with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on the audience's behalf."
"65","tt0166896","4789","8","But it's worth it, because Rose's story cannot help but come out as the film progresses."
"66","tt0166896","4789","9","This film is the story of a journey."
"67","tt0166896","4789","10","But like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense."
"68","tt0166896","4789","11","Early on in the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey, which no elderly gentleman of Alvin's age should reasonably undertake."
"69","tt0166896","4789","12","But along the way, we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective."
"70","tt0166896","4789","13","His objective is very simple and straightforward."
"71","tt0166896","4789","14","His brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him."
"72","tt0166896","4789","15","He has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time."
"73","tt0166896","4789","16","Along the way, Alvin meets many people."
"74","tt0166896","4789","17","The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film."
"75","tt0166896","4789","18","We come to know who Alvin Straight is, from what Alvin Straight does."
"76","tt0166896","4789","19","And at the end of the film, we know who we are .. better."
"77","tt0166896","4790","1","Upon The Straight Story release in 1999, it was praised for being David Lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal."
"78","tt0166896","4790","2","Based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a John Deere '66 mower, at first glance its an odd story for Lynch to direct."
"79","tt0166896","4790","3","Yet as the story develops you can see some of Lynch's trademark motifs coming through."
"80","tt0166896","4790","4","Lynch's focus on small town America and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks, but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down."
"81","tt0166896","4790","5","The restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that I can think of that features a G rating."
"82","tt0166896","4790","6","Incredibly significant, this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced."
"83","tt0166896","4790","7","The Straight Story was the first feature which Lynch directed where he had no hand at writing."
"84","tt0166896","4790","8","For many Lynch devotees this was a huge negative point."
"85","tt0166896","4790","9","Almost universally acclaimed, the only overly negative review by James Brundage of filmcritic.com focused on this very criticism, that it wasn't a typical Lynch film."
"86","tt0166896","4790","10","""Lynch is struggling within the mold of a G Rated story that isn't his own."""
"87","tt0166896","4790","11","Brundage claims, with his protagonist Alvin Straight ""quoting lines directly from Confucious."""
"88","tt0166896","4790","12","He argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse."
"89","tt0166896","4790","13","Yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film."
"90","tt0166896","4790","14","Whilst it is true that it is not Lynch in the sense of Eraserhead, Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive all films which I also adore, The Straight Story features a different side of Lynch that is by no means terrible."
"91","tt0166896","4790","15","If you are a Lynch fan, it is most important to separate that side of Lynch with this feature."
"92","tt0166896","4790","16","The narrative is slow and thoughtful, which gives you a real sense of the protagonist's thoughts as he travels to his destination."
"93","tt0166896","4790","17","Alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife, children and his brother."
"94","tt0166896","4790","18","Yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks, which only adds to the effect, which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents."
"95","tt0166896","4790","19","The conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch."
"96","tt0166896","4790","20","The natural landscapes of the US are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti, makes me yearn to go to America."
"97","tt0166896","4790","21","The performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and Richard Farnsworth is particularly excellent."
"98","tt0166896","4790","22","His Oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win."
"99","tt0166896","4790","23","Regardless, however it is probably the finest swan song for any actor."
"100","tt0166896","4790","24","So whilst The Straight Story features none of Lynch's complex narratives or trademark dialogue, the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended!"
"101","tt0166896","4791","1","Who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother, could possibly be good cinema."
"102","tt0166896","4791","2","I certainly didn't."
"103","tt0166896","4791","3","I thought I knew what to expect: one of the most boring experiences of my life."
"104","tt0166896","4791","4","Well I was as wrong as I haven't been wrong too often yet, because this is one of the best, most realistic and honest Hollywood films I've ever seen..."
"105","tt0166896","4791","5","Giving a short resume of ""The Straight Story"" isn't very difficult."
"106","tt0166896","4791","6","It's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke."
"107","tt0166896","4791","7","That's already special on itself, but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasn't seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument."
"108","tt0166896","4791","8","In the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems, but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life."
"109","tt0166896","4791","9","Despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks, not knowing if he will reach his goal: seeing his brother again before it's too late..."
"110","tt0166896","4791","10","I can easily understand why there are people who don't like this movie and that's also the reason why I will not say that these people don't have a heart or things like that..."
"111","tt0166896","4791","11","This movie hasn't got any flashy action scenes, it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no, you don't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either, because there isn't any."
"112","tt0166896","4791","12","But why should you watch it then."
"113","tt0166896","4791","13","Well, the simple answer is the story."
"114","tt0166896","4791","14","I haven't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from Hollywood and to make things even better from the Disney Studio's that's right, the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense makes it even more special."
"115","tt0166896","4791","15","I'm not ashamed to admit that I had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it, probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me."
"116","tt0166896","4791","16","Some people will argue that the story is very shallow, but I really don't agree with that."
"117","tt0166896","4791","17","Perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and don't want to think any further."
"118","tt0166896","4791","18","If you look close enough than you'll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong, that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too, so they won't make the same mistake."
"119","tt0166896","4791","19","If that isn't deep enough, how much deeper does a story have to go for you then."
"120","tt0166896","4791","20","I would also like to add that this movie really had it all."
"121","tt0166896","4791","21","Some beautiful landscapes finally an American movie that shows something else than the skyline of New York, Chicago or some other big city, some very fine acting by Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek,... and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a David Lynch movie."
"122","tt0166896","4791","22","I know now that I was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldn't be to my taste."
"123","tt0166896","4791","23","It's one of the very best movies I've seen in a long time."
"124","tt0166896","4791","24","This movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye."
"125","tt0166896","4791","25","I give it the full 10/10."
"126","tt0166896","4792","1","The Straight Story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of America."
"127","tt0166896","4792","2","At one level a slow walk through the heartland, it's kind inhabitants, and amber grain, at another level about growing old and remembering what is importantand actively forgetting what isn't."
"128","tt0166896","4792","3","David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said with silence."
"129","tt0166896","4792","4","A remarkable movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come."
"130","tt0166896","4793","1","After seeing this film I feel like I know just a little bit more about the USA."
"131","tt0166896","4793","2","David Lynch is synonymous with shock value and weird for weirdness sake, and indeed these elements are not missing from The Straight Story."
"132","tt0166896","4793","3","However it is in a light that I have not witnessed from Lynch before."
"133","tt0166896","4793","4","We begin with a simple family living a quiet life but end up with an array of absurdly interesting characters with depth in their lives that cannot be apparent from their introduction."
"134","tt0166896","4793","5","Especially moving was the bar scene with two WWII veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how it still affected their current lives and emotions."
"135","tt0166896","4793","6","If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, don't look here."
"136","tt0166896","4793","7","But if you are looking for real people with real stories this is the film for you."
"137","tt0166896","4794","1","It takes patience to get through David Lynch's eccentric, but for a change life affirming chronicle of Alvin Straight's journey, but stick with it."
"138","tt0166896","4794","2","Though it moves as slow as Straight's John Deere, when he meets the kind strangers along his pilgrimage we learn much about the isolation of aging, the painful regrets and secrets, and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation."
"139","tt0166896","4794","3","Richard Farnsworth caps his career with the year's most genuine performance, sad and poetic, flinty and caring."
"140","tt0166896","4794","4","And Sissy Spacek matches him as his ""slow"" daughter Rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad."
"141","tt0166896","4794","5","Rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family."
"142","tt0166896","4795","1","Whenever I hear a movie being touted because it has no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on, my b.s. detector goes off."
"143","tt0166896","4795","2","Usually, a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who don't want anything to surprise them, but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk."
"144","tt0166896","4795","3","So when David Lynch's THE STRAIGHT STORY began getting those kinds of reviews, I was apprehensive, especially since I was not a fan of his other ""uplifting"" story, THE ELEPHANT MAN."
"145","tt0166896","4795","4","For all the stunning images and the good acting in that film, it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us."
"146","tt0166896","4795","5","I needn't have worried."
"147","tt0166896","4795","6","THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one."
"148","tt0166896","4795","7","Most of that is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part."
"149","tt0166896","4795","8","There are a couple of homilies by Straight I could have done without, and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much, but those are only quibbles."
"150","tt0166896","4795","9","There's no heavy handed message, no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions, and no condescension towards us and its characters."
"151","tt0166896","4795","10","Instead, they depend on the story to build its own power, and it does, so by the final scene, we are genuinely moved."
"152","tt0166896","4795","11","Of course, casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the part."
"153","tt0166896","4795","12","He really is someone who looks like he's lived through a lot but still perseveres, and except for those homilies, the desire he has to get back together with his brother doesn't seem overly sentimental, because you can sense here is someone who's lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long."
"154","tt0166896","4795","13","And he knows his time is running out, so he wants to make some peace, not only with his brother, but with his life."
"155","tt0166896","4795","14","Sissy Spacek also does fine, unmannered work as Straight's daughter."
"156","tt0166896","4795","15","And although I am a city and suburban boy, the Iowa and Wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot, making me want at least to visit some day."
"157","tt0166896","4796","1","""A truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love"" describes this odd David Lynch film."
"158","tt0166896","4796","2","This was especially ""odd"" because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 20 years."
"159","tt0166896","4796","3","Those were dark and shocking films Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive and this is the opposite."
"160","tt0166896","4796","4","I know it disappointed a lot of his fans."
"161","tt0166896","4796","5","Others were delighted by it."
"162","tt0166896","4796","6","Count me as one of the latter, and I own all three of those ""dark"" films, too."
"163","tt0166896","4796","7","This was another supposed true life story, here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies."
"164","tt0166896","4796","8","Well, I guess that premise an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles still makes this an ""odd"" film of sorts, so Lynch stays in character with that!"
"165","tt0166896","4796","9","Richard Farnsworth plays the title role."
"166","tt0166896","4796","10","He is the type of guy, face wise, voice wise, low key personality wise, that just about everyone likes."
"167","tt0166896","4796","11","The wrinkles on his face tell many a story."
"168","tt0166896","4796","12","It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released."
"169","tt0166896","4796","13","The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much, and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally challenged child Sissy Spacek and her tragic past, but once Alvin Straight Farnsworth begins his trip, the story picks up."
"170","tt0166896","4796","14","I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up, but I am more generous with it."
"171","tt0166896","4796","15","I think it's a hidden gem."
"172","tt0166896","4796","16","To them, it was a sleeping pill."
"173","tt0166896","4796","17","I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story."
"174","tt0166896","4796","18","It IS slow and if that's okay with you, you might like this."
"175","tt0166896","4796","19","Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way, such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble."
"176","tt0166896","4796","20","Henry Cada as ""Daniel Riordan, is a standout in that regard."
"177","tt0166896","4796","21","Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing, but that's a joke: he's only in the final few minutes of the movie!"
"178","tt0166896","4796","22","The Iowa scenery is pleasant."
"179","tt0166896","4796","23","I lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil."
"180","tt0166896","4796","24","It's a nice state with nice people....like this movie."
"181","tt0166896","4797","1","I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch proved to critics that he has the talent, style, and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he's become known for in the past decade."
"182","tt0166896","4797","2","As much as the film is G rated, it's pure Lynch in style, pacing, and tone."
"183","tt0166896","4797","3","The film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power."
"184","tt0166896","4797","4","The cinematography is terrific, as is to be expected from a Lynch film, and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking."
"185","tt0166896","4797","5","It's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly, kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either ""good"" or ""evil""."
"186","tt0166896","4797","6","Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role."
"187","tt0166896","4797","7","With this film, David Lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80's with 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'."
"188","tt0166896","4797","8","Critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' and 'Lost Highway' but with this film he showed that there was method to FWWM and LH, and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film 'Mulholland Drive', considering the high praise it's received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch.'"
"189","tt0166896","4797","9","Straight Story' is to me one of the most moving motion pictures I've ever seen."
"190","tt0166896","4797","10","It's a loving story about family, friendship, and the kindness of strangers."
"191","tt0166896","4797","11","I would highly recommend it."
"192","tt0166896","4798","1","This is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie Lynch stuff."
"193","tt0166896","4798","2","Rather, it's for those who either appreciate a good story, or have grown tired of the run of the mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and Oprah ish ""This is such a wonderful movie!"
"194","tt0166896","4798","3","You must see it!"""
"195","tt0166896","4798","4","semantics tho' she IS right, for once!."
"196","tt0166896","4798","5","The story unfolds flawlessly, and we are taken along a journey that, I believe, most of us will come to recognize at some time."
"197","tt0166896","4798","6","A compassionate, existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise."
"198","tt0166896","4798","7","Acting is without faults, cinematography likewise occasionally quite brilliant!, and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story."
"199","tt0166896","4798","8","A warm movie."
"200","tt0166896","4798","9","Not excessively sentimental."
"201","tt0166896","4799","1","Perhaps more than many films, this one is not for everyone."
"202","tt0166896","4799","2","For some folks the idea of slowing down, reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell."
"203","tt0166896","4799","3","For others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists, some part they long for contact with."
"204","tt0166896","4799","4","I suppose it's a function of where I am in my own life these days, but I count myself in the camp of the latter group."
"205","tt0166896","4799","5","I found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic, gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological."
"206","tt0166896","4799","6","This is indeed a journey story, a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our days."
"207","tt0166896","4799","7","Much as been written of Mr Farnsworth's presentation of Alvin Straight, though I'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us."
"208","tt0166896","4799","8","Knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish I had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure."
"209","tt0166896","4799","9","I hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people, not just for ""acting"" but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty."
"210","tt0166896","4799","10","Given the realities of production economics, I'm not sure full credit has been given Mr Lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly."
"211","tt0166896","4799","11","An outsider to film production, I nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression ""time is money"" is so accurately descriptive."
"212","tt0166896","4799","12","Going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed, and to his credit Mr Lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story he was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality."
"213","tt0166896","4799","13","No simple task, that."
"214","tt0166896","4799","14","If you'd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself, you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with The Straight Story."
"215","tt0166896","4799","15","And then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night."
"216","tt0166896","4800","1","I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting."
"217","tt0166896","4800","2","These I got."
"218","tt0166896","4800","3","What I wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence."
"219","tt0166896","4800","4","Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition."
"220","tt0166896","4800","5","If you didn't notice, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery."
"221","tt0166896","4800","6","The last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount."
"222","tt0166896","4800","7","The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion."
"223","tt0166896","4800","8","I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention."
"224","tt0168786","1847","1","Whatever you become in your life,you must never forget that you have roots."
"225","tt0168786","1847","2","This is the story of true facts that was made into a beautiful and moving movie!"
"226","tt0168786","1847","3","I dare to say that this movie is well underrated."
"227","tt0168786","1847","4","This shows us a reality of life...the more evil surrounds you ,the better person you become."
"228","tt0168786","1847","5","Trust in your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live it happy...without grudges,without living ""under a rock"" ."

"241","tt0168786","1848","10","Sent to the M.D. as part of a possible pre separation proceeding, Fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist, revealing an awful childhood of great neglect and shuddering brutality."
"242","tt0168786","1848","11","The story develops as Fisher cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest, an enlisted sailor named Cheryl, played by a stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant."
"243","tt0168786","1848","12","Fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor by asking long simmering questions but soon realizes he must seek the answers, however painful, in order to grow and move away from conflict seeking destructive behavior."
"244","tt0168786","1848","13","While all the main characters are black, this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster family settings."
"245","tt0168786","1848","14","Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films, is a picture of sullen immorality but is nothing compared to foster mom, Mrs."
"246","tt0168786","1848","15","Tate Novella Nelson, who in short but searing scenes would earn if it existed the Oscar for gut churning brutality."
"247","tt0168786","1848","16","Films about patient therapist interaction follow a certain predictability all that transference and counter transference stuff but the earnestness of Fisher and his doctor/mentor is realistically gripping."
"248","tt0168786","1848","17","It's a good story, well told."
"249","tt0168786","1848","18","Period."
"250","tt0168786","1848","19","While set in the Navy, ""Antwone Fisher"" is not in any real sense a service story as was ""Men of Honor,"" an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person."
"251","tt0168786","1848","20","Nor is it truly a film about blacks."
"252","tt0168786","1848","21","It's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still ""standing tall."""
"253","tt0168786","1848","22","The persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor."

"255","tt0168786","1848","24","With all the Navy support people listed in the end credits, someone should have told Director Washington that his character, like all naval officers below the rank of commander, is addressed as ""Mister."""

"265","tt0168786","1850","2","I have watched it at least 10 times and I cry every time."
"266","tt0168786","1850","3","My family begs me not to watch it so I wont have a crying fit."
"267","tt0168786","1850","4","I think I love that it is a true story written by Antwone himself just as much as I love the movie."
"268","tt0168786","1850","5","The acting is top notch, and the actors were perfect for their role."
"269","tt0168786","1850","6","Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors."
"270","tt0168786","1850","7","But this is my favorite movie he has done so far."
"271","tt0168786","1850","8","I took care of a little boy who was also born in jail."
"272","tt0168786","1850","9","He was the most precious little boy I had ever met."
"273","tt0168786","1850","10","He has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years."
"274","tt0168786","1850","11","I saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was unsure and I am so happy he is safe and loved."
"275","tt0168786","1850","12","And I am so happy Antwone's happy and found his family."
"276","tt0168786","1850","13","I would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family."
"277","tt0168786","1850","14","I just cant say enough good things about it!!"
"278","tt0168786","1851","1","Saw this film in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee, WI, it's first public screening."
"279","tt0168786","1851","2","THE FILM IS GREAT!!!"
"280","tt0168786","1851","3","Derek Luke is wonderful as Antwone Fisher."
"281","tt0168786","1851","4","This young actor has a very bright future."
"282","tt0168786","1851","5","The real Antwone Fisher did a great job writing the film and Denzel's direction is right on the money."
"283","tt0168786","1851","6","See it opening weekend."
"284","tt0168786","1851","7","You won't be disappointed."
"285","tt0168786","1852","1","Knowing what to expect on the whole from a Denzel Washington performance quality, integrity, gravitas, wry humour will prepare you for what to expect from his directorial debut."
"286","tt0168786","1852","2","Much like Robert De Niro's A Bronx Tale, Antwone Fisher delivers the moving drama of the life of a young man and the effects of key figures in his life."
"287","tt0168786","1852","3","Much as in A Bronx Tale De Niro played one of these key figures to the lead character himself a character was born to play but was too old too Washington takes a similar role in this as the fatherly councellor to the titular character a character that seems like he should be played by a Washington from 20 years ago."
"288","tt0168786","1852","4","Be thankful Washington is too old to play Antwone because if he had we would firstly be deprived of the wonderfully measured and intelligently nuanced performance he gives as the Navy councellor."
"289","tt0168786","1852","5","However more importantly we wouldn't get to see the superb, we can only hope star making, turn from Derek Luke in the title role."
"290","tt0168786","1852","6","Inevitably the character comes across as moulded in Washington's shape, however you get the impression this is not just because Washington directed it, not that Luke was trying to copy him, but that Luke is as genuinely powerful and thought provoking an actor as Washington."
"291","tt0168786","1852","7","It took far too long for Washington to receive the Academy award he deserved for Malcolm X, Philadelphia, Devil In A Blue Dress and The Hurricane, let us hope that Luke does not have to wait so long."
"292","tt0168786","1852","8","Also a great piece of casting was Joy Bryant as Fisher's girlfriend, Cheryl."
"293","tt0168786","1852","9","While the part could have been a forgettable support or a standard 'girlfriend' role Bryant imbues it with life."
"294","tt0168786","1852","10","Tender and intelligent the role transcends stereotyping with Bryant inhabiting it, and she makes the part significant and interesting."
"295","tt0168786","1852","11","It doesn't hurt either that Bryant is possibly the most attractive woman you'll see on celluloid this year the smile alone could thaw the coldest heart."
"296","tt0168786","1852","12","Acting ability and looks why isn't this woman in everything being made right now."
"297","tt0168786","1852","13","Providing good support in a small role in Salli Richardson as Washington's wife Berta."
"298","tt0168786","1852","14","Saying more with a silence or look than many Hollywood actresses can manage in an entire film she informs the audience of the entire storylines long before any exposition occurs."
"299","tt0168786","1852","15","As for Washington's directing, as I said, it is the directing equivalent of his acting."
"300","tt0168786","1852","16","Taking the story of a man few viewers will have heard of and making it genuinely interesting is a difficult feat which Washington achieves with aplomb."
"301","tt0168786","1852","17","The film is neither rushed nor showy, but it never feels slow or dull."
"302","tt0168786","1852","18","It is measured and nuanced, balancing the humour and drama perfectly."
"303","tt0168786","1852","19","Antwone Fisher may not blow you away if you like big, explosive, plotless Hollywood films but for those who appreciate a finely crafted character piece, with excellent performances and steady well handled direction, this is for you."
"304","tt0168786","1853","1","Well, it's yet again a film that plays with your sentiments and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky film."
"305","tt0168786","1853","2","But I'm a sucker for those so I gave it a good score... the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling."
"306","tt0168786","1853","3","The violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change."
"307","tt0168786","1853","4","I'd have given it a 9 if it were not for the salute at the end!"
"308","tt0168786","1853","5","All in all a good movie with very good actors."
"309","tt0168786","1854","1","Having developed a critical eye for film, and a love for good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher with my breath symbolically held."
"310","tt0168786","1854","2","While I am an unabashed fan of Denzel Washington both of his skill as an actor and of his public persona; I am an honest enough fan to admit the very few times when he hasn't quite hit the mark in a film or two."
"311","tt0168786","1854","3","And I could be wrong about those after all, I am not an actor."
"312","tt0168786","1854","4","But this was different Denzel would pour his career's experience into, and guide, a film handling one of the most sensitive topics known to man the abuse of a child."
"313","tt0168786","1854","5","As his directorial debut, no less."
"314","tt0168786","1854","6","And develop the film to point that it would successfully present the triumph of a man."
"315","tt0168786","1854","7","I didn't want to be disappointed."
"316","tt0168786","1854","8","And I wasn't."
"317","tt0168786","1854","9","What I did see is a film full of promise that connected diverse audiences, and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief, but truthful eye into the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell, but who triumphed despite it all."
"318","tt0168786","1854","10","This film did it and nary a dry eye of any color in the theatre proved it."
"319","tt0168786","1854","11","It takes someone to know the topics in this film to know when truth is presented."
"320","tt0168786","1854","12","It takes a talented filmmaker to tell you the story convincingly when you haven't experienced it."
"321","tt0168786","1854","13","And if he can further draw an audience in, and cause an audience to emotionally respond, without pity, the filmmaker has done his job."
"322","tt0168786","1854","14","In any film."
"323","tt0168786","1854","15","Black, white, purple or polka dotted."
"324","tt0168786","1854","16","That is what makes good cinema."
"325","tt0168786","1854","17","Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and most of all, Antwone Fisher you have indeed won."
"326","tt0168786","1855","1","Having not seen all the films released in 2002, I can't say that this is the best film of the year."
"327","tt0168786","1855","2","I can say that it is the best film I have seen all year."
"328","tt0168786","1855","3","Most American films featuring black people either obsess over the American preoccupation with ""race relations"", or fall into the cliches of the inner city ghetto, with every sterotype imaginable spouting ebonic phrased slang."
"329","tt0168786","1855","4","Antwone Fisher stands proudly alone in this regard: race is irrelevant, save for one fight that may, or may not, have been provoked by a racial slur."
"330","tt0168786","1855","5","Antwone Fisher's story is one that should find resonance with any empathic individual."
"331","tt0168786","1855","6","He is understatedly, and thoughtfully, portrayed by Derek Luke."
"332","tt0168786","1855","7","Denzel Washington, while obviously using his star power to have the film made, sticks to the background for the most part, and allows the film to be the Antwone Fisher story."
"333","tt0168786","1855","8","At a time when BET, and popular culture in general want to maintain the ghetoization of a large number of Americans and Canadians too, you know, this is a film that speaks to the humanity in all of us."
"334","tt0168786","1855","9","I just hope that the non Black audience will go see this film for that humanity, rather than avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie whom they can identify with."
"335","tt0168786","1855","10","That would be a sad commentary on race relations in North America in and of itself."
"336","tt0168786","1856","1","He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in `Glory', he proved he was no `Malcolm in the Middle' mediocre actor in `Malcolm X', he showed his brotherly love for acting in `Philadelphia', he pulled a slam dunk in `He Got Game', he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in `The Hurricane', he provided us effective thespian education in `Training Day', and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct!"
"337","tt0168786","1856","2","Denzel Washington's directorial debut `Antwone Fisher' is the most moving film of the year."
"338","tt0168786","1856","3","This tearjerker `fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season."
"339","tt0168786","1856","4","Unlike that Dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher' possesses an emotional joyous conclusion."
"340","tt0168786","1856","5","The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child."
"341","tt0168786","1856","6","Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother."
"342","tt0168786","1856","7","Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the best admirable acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now."
"343","tt0168786","1856","8","I actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting as I have seen in Washington's past performances."
"344","tt0168786","1856","9","It was like if Washington was telling Luke ` la la la Luke I am your acting father'."
"345","tt0168786","1856","10","Ok!"
"346","tt0168786","1856","11","I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away."
"347","tt0168786","1856","12","Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as the psychologist was masterful."
"348","tt0168786","1856","13","But what can you expect from the acting `Master D' himself."
"349","tt0168786","1856","14","`Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself."
"350","tt0168786","1856","15","The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fisher king' material."
"351","tt0168786","1856","16","I hail to the chief `Mr."
"352","tt0168786","1856","17","Washington' in catching the right bait in `Antwone Fisher'."
"353","tt0168786","1856","18","Excellent"
"354","tt0168786","1857","1","This movie was incredible."
"355","tt0168786","1857","2","I would recommend it to anyone, much better than what I had already anticipated."
"356","tt0168786","1857","3","It was definitely a heart wrenching spectacular movie."
"357","tt0168786","1857","4","It is an amazing story, with amazing actors and creators."
"358","tt0168786","1857","5","Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. shouldn't surprise anyone Derek Luke did a wonderful job as well."
"359","tt0168786","1858","1","Unlike other commenters who have commented on this movie's ability to transcend race, contrarily, I think that this powerful film provides a complex and deep story that addresses institutional racism and the effects thereof."
"360","tt0168786","1858","2","Washington directs Fisher's story with a careful hand and critical eye, relinquishing this cinematic endeavor neither to dismemberment of women's bodies, perpetuating unthoughtful stereotypes, nor satisfying the expectation of the white gaze."
"361","tt0168786","1858","3","I think this film might be a bit too happy in the end; however, it is deeply entrenched in Afro American culture and discourse to the point that some white spectators may get the feeling of looking into the life of this Afro American Antwone Fisher."
"362","tt0168786","1858","4","I have problems with the Naval aspect of the film, but when we look at America, there are not many choices or opportunities for black men who are/were in Fisher's situation or similar situations."
"363","tt0168786","1858","5","Viewers may go to this movie expecting a ""Black Movie: what is a ""Black Movie."""
"364","tt0168786","1858","6","Do stereotypes of pimps, whores, drug dealers, single parent homes, and so forth constitute a ""Black Movie."""
"365","tt0168786","1858","7","I think Washington as director recognized that Afro Americans and other people of color deal with human problems like abuse and displaced aggression to name a few."
"366","tt0168786","1858","8","These problems have historically and presently only been given light and validity via ""Good Will Hunting"" and other white movies; it's high time they were given the same recognition and validity as their white counterparts in and out of the media."
"367","tt0168786","1858","9","Sad to say though, in this racist country, Denzel Washington and Derek Luke will probably have to wait another ten years before they receive an Oscar or anything else."
"368","tt0168786","1858","10","They both will have to wait until they direct or star in a movie that perpetuates the usual racist and sexist stereotypes to get an Oscar."
"369","tt0168786","1858","11","That is to say, Denzel deserved awards for ""Malcolm X,"" ""Hurricane"" and others before that jive ""Training Day"" Oscar."
"370","tt0168786","1858","12","That is not to negate or push aside other great actresses and actors of color who are denied their due praise for ingenious work."
"371","tt0168786","1858","13","Yet Hollywood would rather send the message that racism and sexism and heterosexism are acceptable by perpetuating and even rewarding those stereotypes as they appear in countless films such as ""American Beauty,"" ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"" ""American Pie,"" and even ""Gone with the Wind."""
"372","tt0168786","1858","14","Derek Luke is a helluva actor and I wish him best."
"373","tt0168786","1858","15","All of the other actresses and actors gave superb performances hands down, although I do take issue with Denzel's selection of yet another straight haired, light skinned sistuh."
"374","tt0168786","1858","16","That said, everyone should watch this film."
"375","tt0168786","1858","17","However, it may not be for everyone."
"376","tt0168786","1858","18","Much Luv."
"377","tt0168786","1858","19","10/10"
"378","tt0168786","1859","1","In his directorial debut, Denzel Washington takes a true story that also happens to be a very difficult story and brings it to the screen with an honesty that we have come to expect from Washington's acting efforts, but now we see this touch as a director."
"379","tt0168786","1859","2","Recently we have seen some of the disastrous results of kids who have fallen through the cracks of public protection."
"380","tt0168786","1859","3","This story tells of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible scars but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end."
"381","tt0168786","1859","4","We can nit pick on some first effort problems with too many close ups and not the best of editing these scenes but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power cannot be understated."
"382","tt0168786","1859","5","If the academy overlooks this film it will be travesty."
"383","tt0168786","1859","6","This film pulls no punches and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that usually doesn't transcend from a novel to the screen."
"384","tt0168786","1859","7","This , of course , is a tribute to the Director."
"385","tt0168786","1859","8","This is a dandy so go see it and tell your friends to go see it too!"
"386","tt0168786","1860","1","I went to see Antone Fisher not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised."
"387","tt0168786","1860","2","The acting job by Derek Luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent."
"388","tt0168786","1860","3","Of course Denzel Washington did his usual fine job of acting as well as directing."
"389","tt0168786","1860","4","It makes you realized that people with mental problems CAN be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this."
"390","tt0168786","1860","5","Don't miss this one."
"391","tt0168786","1861","1","...intimate and specific."
"392","tt0168786","1861","2","Yes, a bit of a cinderella story, but only after many convoluted turns, earning it's way deeper and deeper into Antwone's psyche."
"393","tt0168786","1861","3","Only superficial viewing can condemn this film as superficial."
"394","tt0168786","1861","4","This is the stuff that heals nations, this is one of our great national stories."
"395","tt0168786","1861","5","Antwone's path to emotional health encompasses a whole breadth of family history, the history of slavery and its aftermath."
"396","tt0168786","1861","6","In his first directorial effort, first of many I hope, Denzel Washington confirms once again, that he has a truly beautiful mind and soul."
"397","tt0168786","1862","1","This film, which is based on a true story, comes from first time director and long time actor, Denzel Washington."
"398","tt0168786","1862","2","Denzel Washington has given us some of the best performances of the last decade, as a black soldier in the Civil War in Glory, and a lawyer in the acclaimed Philadelphia."
"399","tt0168786","1862","3","And of course, he made special notoriety last year when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in Training Day, in which Denzel Washington became the first African American to receive the award for Best Actor."
"400","tt0168786","1862","4","I guess Denzel wanted a change of pace, so he chose to direct Antwone Fisher, in which he also stars."
"401","tt0168786","1862","5","Fisher is played by Derek Luke, who is new to the silver screen, but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as King of Queens, and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of Biker Boyz."
"402","tt0168786","1862","6","This is a truly well done film from Denzel Washington, considering it was his first time directing."
"403","tt0168786","1862","7","Undoubtedly, Denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of Antwone Fisher."
"404","tt0168786","1862","8","Antwone Fisher is about a young African American man in the Navy who constantly gets into fights, and after one particular brawl he is sent to see a Navy psychiatrist named Jerome Davenport, played by Denzel Washington."
"405","tt0168786","1862","9","Davenport helps Antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life, by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison."
"406","tt0168786","1862","10","What makes this film good is the fact that it's not overly melodramatic."
"407","tt0168786","1862","11","I was expecting something a little more like Good Will Hunting, with a lot of swearing, fighting and vulgarity."
"408","tt0168786","1862","12","Not that I didn't like Good Will Hunting, or the swearing, fighting and vulgarity of the film were out of place."
"409","tt0168786","1862","13","Quite the contrary!"
"410","tt0168786","1862","14","However, Antwone Fisher is a true story, and I don't think that Washington wanted to sensationalize the story for dramatic affect in the film."
"411","tt0168786","1862","15","Don't get me wrong, there are moments when we see Antwone fighting, carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him."
"412","tt0168786","1862","16","After all, in his first session with his psychiatrist, the character played by Washington, Devenport asks Fisher where he was born, and Fisher's response is, `from under a rock,' an obvious jab at the pressures waning on Antwone Fisher's soul."
"413","tt0168786","1862","17","But I had to appreciate the fact that this film wasn't sensationalized for dramatic affect."
"414","tt0168786","1862","18","I think it shows real character on the part of Denzel Washington to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichés that are common in Hollywood films, even those based on true stories."
"415","tt0168786","1862","19","One other point that I would like to bring up about Antwone Fisher is the acting."
"416","tt0168786","1862","20","Over all, performances were good in the film, but not great."
"417","tt0168786","1862","21","At times, I think it was a bit obvious that the main characters were actors, but overall, to complain about performances in this film would be ludicrous."
"418","tt0168786","1862","22","One actress that I would like to point out in this film is Viola Davis."
"419","tt0168786","1862","23","She plays Antwone's mother, but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all, but not so much because she appears at the end of the film, but more because she in shock that her long lost son, Antwone has found her."
"420","tt0168786","1862","24","What I would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her."
"421","tt0168786","1862","25","She in basically a character actress, and I haven't seen her play any really elaborate roles."
"422","tt0168786","1862","26","She made appearances in Traffic, Out Of Sight, Kate & Leopold, and two recent films: Far From Heaven and Solaris."
"423","tt0168786","1862","27","In Steven Soderberg's remake of Solaris, she played a scientist on a doomed space craft orbiting a planet."
"424","tt0168786","1862","28","In that film, she is confronted by George Clooney's character and she drawn to tears by what Clooney tells her in a particular scene."
"425","tt0168786","1862","29","When I first saw Solaris, I remember seeing her tear up in the scene and thinking, wow, this woman can act."
"426","tt0168786","1862","30","It was as if you could feel the character's grief."
"427","tt0168786","1862","31","In that brief shot of her face, she gave so much expression and I honestly felt very sorry for her character's sadness and trouble in the film."
"428","tt0168786","1862","32","I think she has definite potential as an actress and should be used more often perhaps in leading roles, rather than just as a character driven actress."
"429","tt0168786","1862","33","Nonetheless, Antwone Fisher is a very good movie."
"430","tt0168786","1862","34","Denzel Washington, as always, pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut."
"431","tt0168786","1862","35","Also, Derek Luke is a very talented actor."
"432","tt0168786","1862","36","I think that Antwone Fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man, but I think that his public popularity will increase with the release of Biker Boyz, which also stars Lawrence Fishburn."
"433","tt0168786","1862","37","Antwone Fisher is based on the book `Finding Fish: A Memoir,' by Antwone Quenton Fisher."
"434","tt0168786","1863","1","ANTWONE FISHER is the story of a young emotionally troubled U.S."
"435","tt0168786","1863","2","Navy seaman."
"436","tt0168786","1863","3","His problems lead him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his troubles stem from his childhood upbringing."
"437","tt0168786","1863","4","Get ready to shed a tear or two."
"438","tt0168786","1863","5","The movie could thaw the coldest heart."
"439","tt0168786","1863","6","I loved the story, which turns from something so very awful to happen to anyone into a positive ending."
"440","tt0168786","1863","7","ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful movie, most importantly about forgiveness."
"441","tt0168786","1863","8","Other important issues that get you thinking are child abuse, adoption, and foster care."
"442","tt0168786","1863","9","Oscar winner, Denzel Washington does an impressive job in his directorial debut."
"443","tt0168786","1863","10","There were many scenes which I enjoyed watching."
"444","tt0168786","1863","11","They included the beginning dreams of a little boy  check out the gigantic sized pancakes!"
"445","tt0168786","1863","12","and the ending dreams turned into reality, which beautifully tied the story together."
"446","tt0168786","1863","13","Another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged Antwone to search for his family to find answers to his questions about his family that abandoned him."
"447","tt0168786","1863","14","My favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction towards him."
"448","tt0168786","1863","15","Priceless."
"449","tt0168786","1863","16","All the actors represented their parts well."
"450","tt0168786","1863","17","In addition to directorial responsibilities, Mr."
"451","tt0168786","1863","18","Washington continues to show why he won an Oscar award and is successful in all his acting roles."
"452","tt0168786","1863","19","He had a strong presence in this movie."
"453","tt0168786","1863","20","Actor, Derek Luke demonstrated why he was so right for the part of Antwone Fisher."
"454","tt0168786","1863","21","He portrayed very real and heart tugging work."
"455","tt0168786","1863","22","Joy Bryant who played the part of Cheryl, Antwone's love interest, resembled a ray of sunshine on the screen."
"456","tt0168786","1863","23","The chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters."
"457","tt0168786","1863","24","Novella Nelson who played the part of Mrs."
"458","tt0168786","1863","25","Tate, a despicable character, deserves special mention."
"459","tt0168786","1863","26","Although we only see her for a few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother gave an outstanding performance."
"460","tt0168786","1863","27","Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER."
"461","tt0168786","1864","1","I just watched Antwone Fisher on BRAVO."
"462","tt0168786","1864","2","What an awesome movie and incredible young man."
"463","tt0168786","1864","3","This movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult."
"464","tt0168786","1864","4","Denzel Washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays Antwone Fisher."
"465","tt0168786","1864","5","Kleenex alert Feel good and tearful."
"466","tt0168786","1864","6","The most heartrending moment is when he finally meets his mother, who he was taken away from at 2 months of age."
"467","tt0168786","1864","7","And one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister."
"468","tt0168786","1864","8","I saw this movie on Bravo in 2008 and only wish I had known about it years ago."
"469","tt0168786","1864","9","Definitely a movie to add to my DVD collection."
"470","tt0168786","1865","1","""And the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom"" Anais Nin Marcel Proust says, ""The real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes."""
"471","tt0168786","1865","2","Author and screenwriter Antwone Fisher joined the U.S."
"472","tt0168786","1865","3","Navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes."
"473","tt0168786","1865","4","Based on his autobiography ""Finding Fish"" written many years after the events, his story is dramatized in the film Antwone Fisher, Denzel Washington's first directorial effort."
"474","tt0168786","1865","5","It is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by one's past to being able to live life in present time."
"475","tt0168786","1865","6","Required to attend therapy sessions after several outbursts of anger at the base, the painful aspects of his childhood are shown in flashback as the grown up Antwone Derek Luke recounts his life in sessions with Navy Psychiatrist Jerome Davenport Denzel Washington."
"476","tt0168786","1865","7","He is at first unwilling to talk, but when he begins, the floodgates are opened."
"477","tt0168786","1865","8","After his father was shot to death by a girlfriend and Antwone was abandoned by his mother after being released from prison, he was placed in a foster home where he lived for fourteen years, suffering humiliation and sexual abuse."
"478","tt0168786","1865","9","According to Antwone, the treatment by his foster mother Mrs."
"479","tt0168786","1865","10","Tate Novella Nelson who referred to him only as ""nigga"" and by his cousin Nadine Yolonda Ross was in fact much worse than shown on the screen."
"480","tt0168786","1865","11","The only friend he has is a local by named Jesse Jascha Washington who, later in the film, only adds to his feelings of abandonment."
"481","tt0168786","1865","12","It is difficult to build a film around psychiatric sessions but it was done successfully in Ordinary People and Good Will Hunting with a great deal more dramatic interest but it succeeds here because of the dominant performances of Washington and Luke, though the film's attempt to compress eleven years into a few months seems a bit too facile."
"482","tt0168786","1865","13","Davenport's humanity and warmth, however, allows Fisher to feel safe enough to discuss his difficult past and Cheryl Joy Bryant, his new girlfriend who is also in the Navy, supports him in his struggle to achieve a breakthrough."
"483","tt0168786","1865","14","With Cheryl's help and Dr."
"484","tt0168786","1865","15","Davenport's counseling, Antwone develops enough self esteem to return to Cleveland and begin the journey to try and find his mother in order to complete the past."
"485","tt0168786","1865","16","What comes through in Derek Luke's incredible performance is Antwone's longing for acceptance, dramatized in a heartbreaking dream shown at the beginning of the film in which he is the guest of honor at a banquet filled with people who love him."
"486","tt0168786","1865","17","Comedian Mort Sahl once said that ""people just have to remember what we're all here for: to find our way home..."""
"487","tt0168786","1865","18","Antwone Fisher touches not only on the longing of one young person to find his way home but reaches all those who have cried themselves to sleep, not knowing the joy of being loved."
"488","tt0168786","1866","1","A great story, based on a true story about a young black man and all the difficulties along the road."
"489","tt0168786","1866","2","Being that this is Denzel Washington's first ever movie that he himself was gonna direct, i have to admit i was a tad sceptical, but who wouldn't be..."
"490","tt0168786","1866","3","But then again, he's a great actor with plently of years of experience, and the end result turned out great."
"491","tt0168786","1866","4","The story is told in a great way, making you that has had difficulties during your childhood, and young adulthood, see yourself in those situations."
"492","tt0168786","1866","5","So, it hits you hard, letting you know your not the only one going through hell."
"493","tt0168786","1866","6","In all, a touching story about a young man trying to make it in this fed up world."
"494","tt0168786","1866","7","The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born 3."
"495","tt0168786","1866","8","August 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, whom was also the writer of this movie Strongly recommended."
"496","tt0168786","1866","9","8/10"
"497","tt0168786","1867","1","this is a film about life, the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit."
"498","tt0168786","1867","2","I defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie."
"499","tt0168786","1867","3","This is more than just a tear jerker, its an engaging, thought provoking drama with excellent performances from all the cast but especially derek Luke and denzel washington. 7 years on, I'm amazed that Luke is still a virtual unknown and washington only directed one other film."
"500","tt0168786","1867","4","Nevertheless, apart from a slow build up, the story of this foster child's trials and tribulations and how it still affects him in adulthood is the sort of movie that stays with you long after you have seen it."
"501","tt0168786","1867","5","Like many fox searchlight pictures, this was more of a sleeper hit and didn't get the mass critical acclaim it deserves."
"502","tt0168786","1867","6","The scene where Antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me, there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but Washington struck exactly the right tone, his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear, while antowne asked simply why."
"503","tt0168786","1867","7","Her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything, what could she say to defend herself."
"504","tt0168786","1867","8","One of the most moving cinematic scenes I have seen."
"505","tt0168786","1868","1","This movie describes the life of somebody who grew up in the worst of circumstances but unlike many people he actually grew up to be a respectable person."
"506","tt0168786","1868","2","Whats more is that this is a true story."
"507","tt0168786","1868","3","Antwone Fisher is so innocent and yet he was abused such just because he was not white."
"508","tt0168786","1868","4","Antwone Fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and he never fooled around with women, coke, cigars, weed, alcohol, or any of those things that are very popular in the places he was growing up."
"509","tt0168786","1868","5","There is not much more to say about this movie it is excellent."
"510","tt0168786","1868","6","The only rating I can give it is a 10/10."
"511","tt0168786","1869","1","Antwone Fisher's story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children."
"512","tt0168786","1869","2","Abandoned by a troubled mother, Antwone has never met his father."
"513","tt0168786","1869","3","Growing up with ""church going"" abusers who use the ""n word"" not only to intimidate and hurt but also as a term of endearment, as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in a hold up, enduring racial slurs and being teased while serving in the Navy, Antwone's anger is slowly turned into positive power when counseled by a Navy psychiatrist, and a love enters his life."
"514","tt0168786","1869","4","The scene where Antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film."
"515","tt0168786","1869","5","Stunned by the unexpected confrontation, the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell her how he has lived a life without crime, addictions to drugs, fathering children left and right, all despite his utterly adverse circumstances."
"516","tt0168786","1869","6","If that scene wasn't powerful enough, the very next one drives it home and opens the flood gates: A reception to welcome home Antwone; dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that HE is part of this great family."
"517","tt0168786","1869","7","One of the messages delivered by this wonderful film is that there are many well meaning and sincere people working to help orphans and unwanted children."
"518","tt0168786","1869","8","Even if some of the homes and administrators don't seem to care and appear self serving, many do give it their all."
"519","tt0168786","1869","9","The character who found Antwone's ""file"" once he disclosed the circumstances of his birth is one of those ""bright lights"" in the darkness of the system."
"520","tt0168786","1869","10","The DVD includes a French Language track, various subtitle choices, as well as additional features and information about foster parenting."
"521","tt0168786","1869","11","As a Clevelander I appreciated the location footage."

"525","tt0168786","1870","3","I couldn't relate about the racial discrimination that Antwone has experienced because I'm living in my own country."
"526","tt0168786","1870","4","I guess it is really hard to be discriminated."
"527","tt0168786","1870","5","We watched this film in our sociology class in New Era University,and I didn't knew that It was a true story, I thought it was just created by an intellectual who want to bring a fresh air in the industry."
"528","tt0168786","1870","6","It is very good."
"529","tt0168786","1870","7","The part that shocked me was when Nadine abused Antwone who was just six sexually."

"531","tt0168786","1870","9","I salute him for he being so strong!"
"532","tt0168786","1870","10","The scene that touched me here is when Antwone finally saw his mother Eva face to face."
"533","tt0168786","1870","11","He did not bitched her or whatever,instead he told her about the achievements that he got within the long years that they have been separated."
"534","tt0168786","1870","12","I think I'll do that when I get the chance of tracing my roots."
"535","tt0168786","1871","1","I was adopted at birth and certainly did NOT have the problems Antwone fisher had in the movie, but I still share some of the emotions and this movie really helped to bring them out and force me to deal with them."
"536","tt0168786","1871","2","It even caused me to realize that I do have a ""missing piece"" and I am going to seek out my birthparents now."
"537","tt0168786","1871","3","I cried for almost a day after I saw this the first time."
"538","tt0168786","1871","4","Antwone's confrontation with his birthmother juxtaposed with his father's family's reaction to his sudden appearance are powerful for those of us who don't know what will happen if we find our birth parents."
"539","tt0168786","1871","5","And his self confidence and self affirmations to his mother and against the abusers of his past were so powerful."
"540","tt0168786","1871","6","I could really identify with this and my need to tell people ""yeah, I was put aside by my parents when I was born."
"541","tt0168786","1871","7","BUT another set of parents picked me up and loved me."
"542","tt0168786","1871","8","And now I am a success!"""
"543","tt0168786","1871","9","It also helped my wife understand me and our adopted children, who did go through tragic experiences before they came to our home."
"544","tt0168786","1871","10","And it helped me to realize just how messed up our social system is."
"545","tt0168786","1871","11","If you remember reading the story last year about the foster kid in Florida who was ""lost"" AND then the ""Miranda & Ashley"" story in Oregon City where SCF ignored multiple sexual abuse complaints about the man who ultimately killed them AND the week this movie was released, yet another story in New Jersey of three kids who were ignored by the system."

"547","tt0168786","1871","13","The state apparently thought the home they were in was ok because the guardian was employed as a stripper and ""only occasionally"" used heroin!"
"548","tt0168786","1871","14","There are just so many issues that are brought out in this movie and they are dealt with so well by the script and by the acting that Antwone Fisher should be a ""Best Picture"" nominee for sure."
"549","tt0168786","1871","15","No matter if you are adopted or not, it is a heart tugger that can't be ignored by anyone concerned about children in our society."
"550","tt0168786","1872","1","Not having seen the film in the original theater release, I was happily surprised when the DVD arrived, since this film did not have the wide distribution it merited."
"551","tt0168786","1872","2","Denzel Washington directorial debut and the finished product have nothing to envy other films about the same theme by more accomplished directors."
"552","tt0168786","1872","3","The film has a very professional look."
"553","tt0168786","1872","4","It shows that Mr."
"554","tt0168786","1872","5","Washington has learned a lot being on the other side of the camera."
"555","tt0168786","1872","6","He brings a different angle to this film."
"556","tt0168786","1872","7","One of the best things the film has is, without a doubt, the fine performance by Derek Luke."

"558","tt0168786","1872","9","His take on the troubled young man, at this point of his life, in turmoil and suffering for a bad hand life, up to now, has dealt him, is very true."

"574","tt0168786","1872","25","He can help Antwone, but he cannot help himself, or his relationship with an adoring wife."
"575","tt0168786","1872","26","The talent in the film is incredible."
"576","tt0168786","1872","27","Joy Bryant makes a fine Cheryl."

"578","tt0168786","1872","29","Tate, the abusing foster mother."
"579","tt0168786","1872","30","The reunion of Antwone with his unknown family is a bit too sugary and sentimental, but of course, if one is to believe that Fisher finds happiness at last, one has to accept that part of the film as well."

"592","tt0168786","1874","2","There are so many out there."
"593","tt0168786","1874","3","To think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deep about life and how the world has and always will be."

"619","tt0168786","1876","7","Thank you"
"620","tt0171736","2135","1","Shall We Dance is an excellent film because it shows how something, like dancing, can rejuvenate the life flow in the human spirit."
"621","tt0171736","2135","2","Dance is seen as the expression of existence, and the birth of individuality."
"622","tt0171736","2135","3","The is certainly the case with Aoki."
"623","tt0171736","2135","4","At work he is a humble office denizen, but place him on the dance floor and all his bottled up intensity is released."
"624","tt0171736","2135","5","Surprisingly, this release is frowned upon in Japan, due to the rigid culture of conformity."
"625","tt0171736","2135","6","At the start of the film, all the characters are ashamed or frightened of their desire to dance."
"626","tt0171736","2135","7","They will be scorned, or deemed perverted, for expressing their passion through dance."
"627","tt0171736","2135","8","This film is well worth watching to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions."
"628","tt0171736","2135","9","It will leave a smile on your face for days."
"629","tt0171736","2136","1","I thought this film was just about perfect."
"630","tt0171736","2136","2","The descriptions/summaries you'll read about this movie don't do it justice."
"631","tt0171736","2136","3","The plot just does not sound very interesting, BUT IT IS."
"632","tt0171736","2136","4","Just rent it and you will not be sorry!!"
"633","tt0171736","2137","1","This is far more than the charming story of middle aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing although it IS that as well."
"634","tt0171736","2137","2","It's the tale of one person learning to love life again, pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more."
"635","tt0171736","2137","3","The bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern Japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact."
"636","tt0171736","2137","4","There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... a few where you'll want to get up and tango ... and many others where you'll just feel good."
"637","tt0171736","2137","5","This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all Japanese movies are ""heavy"" and inaccessible."
"638","tt0171736","2138","1","This film revolves as much around Japanese culture as it does the lives of one modern Japanese family."
"639","tt0171736","2138","2","Physical contact is frowned upon for those over 7 especially in public hence all that bowing instead of hugging even when you are close friends/ relatives."
"640","tt0171736","2138","3","Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and that in public too!"
"641","tt0171736","2138","4","Never the less Ballroom dancing is on the quite immensely popular."
"642","tt0171736","2138","5","People who do Ballroom dancing in Japan are viewed a bit like nudists in the west... many more would like to than do but are inhibited by the culture."
"643","tt0171736","2138","6","A delightful family film, which any amateur dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone."
"644","tt0171736","2138","7","I understand that it was more popular than Titanic in Japan."
"645","tt0171736","2138","8","I guess the Japanese are just like the rest of us they like to be hugged too."
"646","tt0171736","2139","1","I approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised."
"647","tt0171736","2139","2","It is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years, especially ""Strictly Ballroom""."
"648","tt0171736","2139","3","While the music is nice and the dancing colourful, for me the movie is not about dancing."
"649","tt0171736","2139","4","It is about the very Japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families."
"650","tt0171736","2139","5","Here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life."
"651","tt0171736","2139","6","He is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing."
"652","tt0171736","2139","7","Also Japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted, at least eventually, by family and audience."
"653","tt0171736","2139","8","Attitudes to ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are definitely non Western, though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to Japan."
"654","tt0171736","2139","9","The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing."
"655","tt0171736","2139","10","Even without the cultural insights, the colour, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch."
"656","tt0171736","2140","1","Absolutely stunning, warmth for the head and the heart."
"657","tt0171736","2140","2","The kind of movie western movie makers are too rushed, too frenetic to even attempt."
"658","tt0171736","2140","3","My kids watched it, and they loved it too."
"659","tt0171736","2140","4","What real people goes to show you how cultural differences the Japanese setting is less important than the human similarities."
"660","tt0171736","2140","5","Go see it, whether you like dancing or not."
"661","tt0171736","2141","1","Masayuki Suo, who directed this fine film, is on a role."
"662","tt0171736","2141","2","After the decent ""Fancy Dance"" and the classic in Japan, anyway college sumo comedy ""Shiko Funjatta"", Suo has followed his own huge footsteps with a smashing success."
"663","tt0171736","2141","3","The story is engaging."
"664","tt0171736","2141","4","We both laugh often Naoto Takenaka is hilarious, as he is in Suo's two previous films and really root for the characters."
"665","tt0171736","2141","5","But to me the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into Japanese society real life in Japan."
"666","tt0171736","2141","6","Suo has a knack for showing real life activities with entertaining flair."
"667","tt0171736","2141","7","The result is a movie that will pull you in, make you laugh, make you think, and both entertain you and give you insight into today's Japan."
"668","tt0171736","2141","8","Also look for the the main 8 actors from Shiko Funjatta, as they all appear again in various roles, from supporting characters Takenaka to short cameos many."
"669","tt0171736","2142","1","This is a very real and funny movie about a Japanese man having a mid life crisis."
"670","tt0171736","2142","2","In Japan, ballroom dancing is not approved of."
"671","tt0171736","2142","3","But when Shohei Sugiyama becomes obsessed with meeting the beautiful young girl he sees in the window of a dance studio, he suddenly finds himself enrolled in dance classes."

"673","tt0171736","2142","5","But he must keep his secret pleasure from his coworkers and family."
"674","tt0171736","2142","6","When the truth comes out it is quite funny."
"675","tt0171736","2143","1","It is not the same as the other films about dancing."
"676","tt0171736","2143","2","A few normal people found themselves from dancing."
"677","tt0171736","2143","3","Unlike the dancing films in Hollywood, the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people."
"678","tt0171736","2143","4","They are someone that you may see everyday in your offices."
"679","tt0171736","2143","5","They are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing."
"680","tt0171736","2143","6","This touches me very deeply."
"681","tt0171736","2144","1","A sweet and totally charming film, Shall We Dansu. made me laugh and cry."
"682","tt0171736","2144","2","At first appearance, Sugiyama san was not terribly appealing an uptight salaryman, seemingly devoted to his family, but all too easily captivated by a face in a window."
"683","tt0171736","2144","3","The object of his obsession is distant and cold."
"684","tt0171736","2144","4","But by the end of the movie, I was in love with him, her, his wife and daughter, all the dance instructors and dance students."
"685","tt0171736","2144","5","This uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that I would enjoy seeing again."
"686","tt0171736","2145","1","""Shall We Dance."", a light hearted flick from Japan, tells of an overworked accountant and family man who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he see's from the train during his daily commute."
"687","tt0171736","2145","2","What he finds in the studio are lessons in dancing and, most of all, himself."
"688","tt0171736","2145","3","Funny, poignant, and utterly charming, ""SWD"" is an award winning film well worth a look by more mature viewers."
"689","tt0171736","2145","4","B"
"690","tt0171736","2146","1","I just saw this delightful Japanese feature film at the 5th Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival in the historic Virginia Theatre in Champaign, Illinois."
"691","tt0171736","2146","2","Although this film, subtitled in English, has ballroom dancing as its heart, the film actually shows the world outside of Japan how the rigid structures of family, employment salaryman, and recreation still exist in Modern day Japan."
"1","tt0171736","2148","1","I always look forward to this movie when its on TV."
"2","tt0171736","2148","2","Have to get the DVD I guess."
"3","tt0171736","2148","3","The range of different types of people is great."

"8","tt0171736","2148","8","It is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing."
"9","tt0171736","2148","9","Unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to Blackpool."
"10","tt0171736","2148","10","Would make for the perfect sequel if they had."
"11","tt0171736","2148","11","But I guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened."
"12","tt0171736","2148","12","A very simple and innocent story."

"17","tt0171736","2148","17","I think Richard Gere more matches the original than Lopez."
"18","tt0171736","2148","18","I have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent."
"19","tt0171736","2149","1","Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is someone we know in everyday life."

"26","tt0171736","2149","8","Aoki's character is both hilarious and pitiful."
"27","tt0171736","2149","9","Masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife, you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right."
"28","tt0171736","2149","10","This film is truly a keeper."
"29","tt0171736","2150","1","If you are tired of films trying too hard to be fairy tales the ""Pretty Woman"" variety love story, here is a beautiful film in which a Japanese businessman is pulled free from his robotic, dispassionate life when he falls in love...with dancing."
"30","tt0171736","2150","2","Wonderfully drawn characters bring to life a story that is at once deeply funny and poignantly moving."
"31","tt0171736","2151","1","Funny."
"32","tt0171736","2151","2","Sad."
"33","tt0171736","2151","3","Charming."
"34","tt0171736","2151","4","These are all words that floated through my head while I was watching this beautiful, simple film."
"35","tt0171736","2151","5","It is rare that a movie truly moves me, but ""Shall We Dance."" accomplished that with grace to spare."
"36","tt0171736","2151","6","Gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie viewing history."
"37","tt0171736","2151","7","It left me with a quiet sense of exultation, but with a small touch of sadness mixed in."
"38","tt0171736","2151","8","And the dancing, oh yes, the dancing."
"39","tt0171736","2151","9","Even if you are not a lover of the art, or can't put one foot in front of another, the steps displayed here will take your breath away, and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can."
"40","tt0171736","2151","10","It was absolutely enchanting, even the parts that show Sugiyama's touchingly portrayed by Koji Yakusho stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous, child like way."
"41","tt0171736","2151","11","And yet, this film was not entirely about dancing, but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings."
"42","tt0171736","2151","12","We witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art, and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast."
"43","tt0171736","2151","13","Beauty."
"44","tt0171736","2151","14","Pain."
"45","tt0171736","2151","15","Emotion."
"46","tt0171736","2151","16","All the love and little agonies of life are here, expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture."
"47","tt0171736","2152","1","There were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life not only in Japan, but everywhere."
"48","tt0171736","2152","2","It shows how stifling ones culture can be, and wanting to break out of the mold its created for you."
"49","tt0171736","2152","3","The dancing was just a vehicle for saying ""do what you love even if its against the norm""."
"50","tt0171736","2152","4","Rather Billy Elliot like I would say."
"51","tt0171736","2152","5","I enjoyed that film as well."
"52","tt0171736","2152","6","The humour was well timed, and the touching moments felt so real, you could feel the awkwardness between Sugiyama and his wife, the tantrums in the dance hall."
"53","tt0171736","2152","7","I loved Aoki him and that wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me simply howl!"
"54","tt0171736","2152","8","The actors all did a wonderful job, the story was well written."
"55","tt0171736","2152","9","I watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that I missed on the first viewing."
"56","tt0171736","2152","10","Good entertainment!"
"57","tt0171736","2153","1","This movie was charming."
"58","tt0171736","2153","2","An accountant wants more from life than the approved conventional success."
"59","tt0171736","2153","3","What makes it work so well, and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it really isn't about becoming ""Great"" it is simply about finding a way to express one's self."
"60","tt0171736","2153","4","The big triumph at the end is not the winning of a contest, not the discovery of a whole new life style, but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life."
"61","tt0171736","2153","5","No one is discovering their passion, they are finding their quiet soul."
"62","tt0171736","2153","6","The Japanese background makes the subtle oppression and ""secret life"" of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal."
"63","tt0171736","2153","7","We can all see ourselves in the everyman."
"64","tt0171736","2154","1","I have seen this movie many many times and I will never get tired of it."
"65","tt0171736","2154","2","It is a classic in every sense of the word."
"66","tt0171736","2154","3","The movie is hysterically funny and yet quite touching all at the same time."
"67","tt0171736","2154","4","For those of you who are not a fan of ""subtitles"" or of foreign film in general, open your mind."
"68","tt0171736","2154","5","This is a great movie for ""the beginner"" because the story is so entertaining."
"69","tt0171736","2154","6","Don't get me wrong, it is 100% Japanese and that is what makes it work, but everyone will get something out of it even if it is just a great laugh at one of the main characters called Mr."
"70","tt0171736","2154","7","Aoki one of the funniest characters I have ever seen!"
"71","tt0171736","2154","8","I can't even think of this movie without smiling!!"
"72","tt0171736","2154","9","I love it ... and I think most people will too."
"73","tt0171736","2155","1","The accountant Shohei Sugiyama Kôji Yakusho is feeling bored with his routine life, limited to hard work and stay at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama Hideko Hara and his teenager's daughter."
"74","tt0171736","2155","2","One night, while traveling home by train, he sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawa Tamiyo Kusakari in the balcony of a dance school, and a couple of days later, he decides to visit the school and secretly take ballroom dance lessons every Wednesdays night."

"76","tt0171736","2155","4","Meanwhile, Masako feels the changes in the behavior of her happier husband, and hires a private eye to investigate whether Shohei is having an affair."
"77","tt0171736","2155","5","I have just finished watching ""Shall We Dansu."" and I really loved it."
"78","tt0171736","2155","6","What a lovely and delightful movie!"
"79","tt0171736","2155","7","The story is amazingly good, with drama, comedy and romance."
"80","tt0171736","2155","8","The cast is excellent, and I was particularly impressed with the cold beauty and graciousness of the wife of the director Masayuki Suo and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari."
"81","tt0171736","2155","9","On last September 06th, I saw the American remake of ""Shall We Dansu."" for the first time, and I found it a delightful entertainment."
"82","tt0171736","2155","10","But now I can say that it is another unnecessary remake, and I recommend this original film instead."
"83","tt0171736","2155","11","My vote is ten."
"84","tt0171736","2155","12","Title Brazil: ""Dança Comigo."""
"85","tt0171736","2155","13","""Dance With Me."""
"86","tt0171736","2156","1","This movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog."
"87","tt0171736","2156","2","The similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films, is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson."
"88","tt0171736","2156","3","In Japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio."
"89","tt0171736","2156","4","In the instant that it takes his train to pass, he is enthralled by her."
"90","tt0171736","2156","5","But is it only by her beauty, by her faraway glance, or a connection that they will both discover that they share."
"91","tt0171736","2156","6","Shall We Dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance."
"92","tt0171736","2156","7","Breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of Japanese society, they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away."
"93","tt0171736","2156","8","It is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be."
"94","tt0171736","2157","1","Okay."
"95","tt0171736","2157","2","As you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films."
"96","tt0171736","2157","3","This is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious."
"97","tt0171736","2157","4","The main character is a business man who is stuck in a ""same thing, different day"" mentality."
"98","tt0171736","2157","5","He sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from his train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her."
"99","tt0171736","2157","6","He decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the instructor."
"100","tt0171736","2157","7","From there he bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman."
"101","tt0171736","2157","8","There is no gratuitous or any sex involved, just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed."
"102","tt0171736","2157","9","This film was remade with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original."
"103","tt0171736","2157","10","The movie never made it big in America because it was not eligible for the Oscars since it was broadcast on television in Japan movies cannot be released on TV or they are disqualified for Oscar nominations."
"104","tt0171736","2157","11","It did win numerous awards in Japan for best film, cast, director etc for their ""Oscar"" awards."
"105","tt0171736","2158","1","I don't like ""grade inflation"" but I just had to give this a 10."
"106","tt0171736","2158","2","I can't think of anything I didn't like about it."
"107","tt0171736","2158","3","I saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it."
"108","tt0171736","2158","4","I'm sure that the Hollywood remake that someone told me about, with J Lo and Richard Gear, will be excellent, but this original Japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought provoking for me that I am hard pressed to think of any way that it could be improved, or its setting changed to a different culture."
"109","tt0171736","2158","5","A story I found worth watching, and with o fist fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort!"
"110","tt0171736","2158","6","Imagine that!"
"111","tt0171736","2158","7","All the characters seemed well developed, ... even non primary characters had good character development and enjoyable acting, and the casting seemed very appropriate."
"112","tt0171736","2158","8","It's always hard to find a good movie musical in our day and age, and perhaps this doesn't quite qualify there is plenty of learning how to dance, but no singing but I really think that Gene Kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man, successful with a family in Japan, looking for something... he knows not precisely what."
"113","tt0171736","2158","9","To the team of people in Japan who contributed to this film, thank you for creating and doing it."
"114","tt0171736","2159","1","First, there is NO way the remake can be as good, because Japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such a major part in this film, as explained in the opening narration."
"115","tt0171736","2159","2","It adds to the humor as well as warmth of this movie."
"116","tt0171736","2159","3","There is slew of different supporting characters/personalities."
"117","tt0171736","2159","4","Each does there part in making this movie wonderful."
"118","tt0171736","2159","5","This movie is full of comedy that isn't vulgar in anyway like most of today's ""gross out comedies."""
"119","tt0171736","2159","6","Yet it can still have you laughing out loud."
"120","tt0171736","2159","7","The reality is, in real life, you don't have a choice of who you work with or go to school with...etc."
"121","tt0171736","2159","8","This movie truly emphasizes that and shows that the natural good in people can overcome petty differences."
"122","tt0171736","2159","9","Not to mention, it makes for a great sub plot and much of the humor."
"123","tt0171736","2159","10","This is a story about dance that actually has a story, and a good one at that."
"124","tt0171736","2159","11","There are a few back stories that are not out of place, but actually support the main storyline."
"125","tt0171736","2159","12","Truly a well written film."
"126","tt0171736","2159","13","The dancing is great, too."
"127","tt0171736","2159","14","I happen to be a fan of any movie with dancing of any sort, for that aspect."
"128","tt0171736","2159","15","However, this movie goes beyond any other with dance, in the fact that, it is a story First and just happens to be written about dancing in Japanse society."
"129","tt0171736","2159","16","Highly recommended.10 out of 10."
"130","tt0171736","2160","1","This film is about a man who has been too caught up with the accepted convention of success, trying to be ever upwardly mobile, working hard so that he could be proud of owning his own home."
"131","tt0171736","2160","2","He assumes this is all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dancing, all because he wanted to get a closer look of a beautiful girl that he sees by the dance studio everyday while riding the subway on his way home."
"132","tt0171736","2160","3","His was infatuated with her at first, going to the dance class just to idolize her, but he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing."
"133","tt0171736","2160","4","It eventually becomes apparent to him that there is more to life than working yourself to death."
"134","tt0171736","2160","5","There is a set of oddball characters also learning in the studio, giving the film a lot of laughs and some sense of bonding between the dejected."
"135","tt0171736","2160","6","There is also revelations of various characters, including the girl he initially admired, giving some depth to them by showing their blemished past and their struggle to overcome it."
"136","tt0171736","2160","7","The dancing was also engaging, with the big competition at the end, but it is not the usual story where our underdog come out at the top by winning it."
"137","tt0171736","2160","8","Instead, there are downfalls, revelations and redemption."
"138","tt0171736","2160","9","All these makes it a moving and fun film to watch."
"139","tt0171736","2161","1","How many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free."
"140","tt0171736","2161","2","Most of us, I suspect."
"141","tt0171736","2161","3","Shall we dance. is not a movie about dancing."
"142","tt0171736","2161","4","It is about learning about ourselves, recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it."
"143","tt0171736","2161","5","Mr Sugiyama is a middle aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour."
"144","tt0171736","2161","6","One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy. he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons."
"145","tt0171736","2161","7","He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule."
"146","tt0171736","2161","8","He hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family."
"147","tt0171736","2161","9","There is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practising some dance steps."
"148","tt0171736","2161","10","There are many other funny and warm hearted scenes."
"149","tt0171736","2161","11","The ending is not a fairytale, but it leaves the viewer feeling good."
"150","tt0171736","2161","12","This movie helped me to understand the Japanese people a little better."
"151","tt0171736","2161","13","It is a warm and very worthwhile film to see."
"152","tt0171736","2162","1","I was so surprised when I saw this film so much underrated..."
"153","tt0171736","2162","2","I understand why some of you dislike this movie."
"154","tt0171736","2162","3","Its pace is slow, a characteristic of Japanese films."
"155","tt0171736","2162","4","Nevertheless, if you are absorbed in the film like me, you will find this not a problem at all."
"156","tt0171736","2162","5","I must say this is the best comedy I have ever seen."
"157","tt0171736","2162","6","""Shall We Dansu."" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies."
"158","tt0171736","2162","7","It is very different from Hollywood ones, e.g."
"159","tt0171736","2162","8","Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes."
"160","tt0171736","2162","9","Rather, it is light hearted, a movie that makes you feel good."
"161","tt0171736","2162","10","I love the movie because it makes me feel ""real""."
"162","tt0171736","2162","11","The plot is straightforward yet pleasing."
"163","tt0171736","2162","12","I was so delighted seeing that Sugiyama the main role has found the meaning of life in dancing."
"164","tt0171736","2162","13","Before I watched the film I was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork."
"165","tt0171736","2162","14","I felt lost."
"166","tt0171736","2162","15","However, this film made me think of the bright side of life."
"167","tt0171736","2162","16","I believed I was in the same boat of Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn't I."
"168","tt0171736","2162","17","It reminded me of ""exploring my own future"" and discovering the happiness in my daily life."
"169","tt0171736","2162","18","It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers."
"170","tt0171736","2162","19","While some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect, I kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really ""alive"", learning to dance as the film goes on."
"171","tt0171736","2162","20","Over all, this film is encouraging and heart warming."
"172","tt0171736","2162","21","As a comedy, it does its job perfectly."
"173","tt0171736","2162","22","It definitely deserves 10 stars."
"174","tt0171736","2162","23","And yes Aoki is funny : D"
"175","tt0171736","2163","1","I simply love this movie."
"176","tt0171736","2163","2","It is a perfect example of the well rounded surprising stories that come out of Asian cinema."
"177","tt0171736","2163","3","There was a recent Hollywood remake of this movie, with Richard Gere and the simply awful Jennifer Lopez."
"178","tt0171736","2163","4","Please do not confuse the two movies."
"179","tt0171736","2163","5","The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and wonderfully acted."
"180","tt0171736","2163","6","The Hollywood version is the exact opposite."
"181","tt0171736","2163","7","I was aghast when I first saw the trailer for the remade US Version and who was starring in it."
"182","tt0171736","2163","8","It's typical Hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at it's worst."
"183","tt0171736","2163","9","The remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon."
"184","tt0171736","2163","10","The ONLY reason the original film did not become more widely viewed is the US audience's aversion to subtitles."
"185","tt0171736","2163","11","One of the main reasons this movie would never work in an American telling is that the reserved, ultra socially conservative character of the public Japanese persona is at issue in this movie."
"186","tt0171736","2163","12","Certainly the main character awakens to a more full understanding of living a vivacious life through dance, but half of the movie's tension comes from the stereotypes and ridicule ballroom dancers face in Japan."
"187","tt0171736","2163","13","Please try to see this movie in it's original form, not the terrible full screen."
"188","tt0171736","2163","14","And please DO skip the US remake....it's a shallow travesty in comparison to the original Japanese movie."
"189","tt0171736","2163","15","Yes, I know the ""original"" movie is much older, and this is simply a Japanese take on the story, but the only two people are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new US remake."
"190","tt0171736","2163","16","Speaking of foreign films, I'll make a few quick recommendations: 1."
"191","tt0171736","2163","17","Monsoon Wedding I list this first for a reason, outstanding film!"
"192","tt0171736","2163","18","2."
"193","tt0171736","2163","19","Johnny Stechino Very funny Italian mistaken identity flic!"
"194","tt0171736","2163","20","3."
"195","tt0171736","2163","21","Shiri A Korean action pic that mixes both Asian flare & US style plot 4."
"196","tt0171736","2163","22","Run Lola Run A German film that integrates it's techno score ingeniously."
"197","tt0171736","2163","23","Well, just a quick list anyway :"
"198","tt0171736","2164","1","Watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line, the excellent character development, and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a whole."
"199","tt0171736","2164","2","Without giving away too much of the plot, it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons."
"200","tt0171736","2164","3","Along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves."
"201","tt0171736","2164","4","The story has a prologue about what dancing in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so it isn't exactly as simple to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the U.S."
"202","tt0171736","2164","5","The film is lighthearted; you'll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags."
"203","tt0171736","2164","6","Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe."
"204","tt0171736","2164","7","All of the film's characters are taken seriously, as they are, and none are diminished because of their ""imperfections."""
"205","tt0171736","2164","8","I've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends."
"206","tt0171736","2164","9","It just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance."
"207","tt0171736","2164","10","Is this synchronous or what."
"208","tt0171736","2164","11","I think so because now I'm really geeked to give it a try."
"209","tt0171736","2164","12","Watch this wonderful family film small children might not get it, but teens certainly would and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again."
"210","tt0171736","2164","13","Why they would make a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as is."
"211","tt0184424","3882","1","i watched this tape, immediately rewound it, watched it again and laughed twice as hard."
"212","tt0184424","3882","2","I strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of, but uncomfortable around transvestites."
"213","tt0184424","3882","3","It shows you that transvestitism is a feature, rather than the entirety of one's being."
"214","tt0184424","3882","4","The comedy is not single issue."
"215","tt0184424","3882","5","This man is brilliant."
"216","tt0184424","3882","6","All comics should aspire to his level of candor, intelligence and talent."
"217","tt0184424","3883","1","Until I saw this special on HBO, I had never heard of Eddie Izzard."
"218","tt0184424","3883","2","I sure am glad that I have now!"
"219","tt0184424","3883","3","He is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen!"
"220","tt0184424","3883","4","Rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then Eddie."
"221","tt0184424","3883","5","I could not stop laughing for the entire show."
"222","tt0184424","3883","6","If you like to laugh you HAVE to see this special!"
"223","tt0184424","3884","1","Izzard was both hysterical and insightful in his humor."
"224","tt0184424","3884","2","He definitely represents his own little niche in the comedic world."
"225","tt0184424","3884","3","It's a pity more Americans won't see this stand up routine due to its PAL only availability."
"226","tt0184424","3885","1","I was first introduced to ""Eddie"" by friends from ""across the pond"" who know I like intelligent humor."
"227","tt0184424","3885","2","I prefer comedians who can be thought provoking while entertaining such as George Carlin and Dennis Miller."
"228","tt0184424","3885","3","In 'Dress to Kill' Eddie provides the same type of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject all the while causing your side to split at the same time."
"229","tt0184424","3885","4","There is a wide range of subjects in this stand up and they are simply hysterical."
"230","tt0184424","3885","5","The piece on how to decide on Englebert's stage name will leave you in stitches!"
"231","tt0184424","3885","6","Thanks Andrew and Catherine! ... and ""Do you have a Flag."""
"232","tt0184424","3886","1","Eddie Izzard is genius with his non stop humor."
"233","tt0184424","3886","2","I could listen all day."
"234","tt0184424","3886","3","His unique approach to life is quite logical."
"235","tt0184424","3886","4","His understanding of discovery such as the Heimlich Maneuver is creative."
"236","tt0184424","3886","5","Eddie Izzard captures the heart of what we think."
"237","tt0184424","3886","6","I don't know when I laughed so hard at anyone's off beat mind."
"238","tt0184424","3887","1","I managed to tape this off my satellite, but I would love to get an original release in a format we can use here in the States."
"239","tt0184424","3887","2","Eddie truly is Glorious in this performance from San Francisco."
"240","tt0184424","3887","3","I don't remember laughing so hard at a stand up routine."
"241","tt0184424","3887","4","My wife and I both enjoyed this tape and his work on Glorious I just wish I could buy a copy and help support Eddie financially through my purchase."
"242","tt0184424","3887","5","We need more of his shows available."
"243","tt0184424","3888","1","This is definatley one of the best stand up shows evre."
"244","tt0184424","3888","2","EVER."
"245","tt0184424","3888","3","Eddie is so off the wall that I've been watching this damn show for nearly five years now, and it still rocks every single time."
"246","tt0184424","3888","4","Just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks, it's a masterpeice."
"247","tt0184424","3888","5","You need look no further than this line ""The word herb."
"248","tt0184424","3888","6","You say erb, and we say herb, cuz ther's a f###ing h in it""."
"249","tt0184424","3888","7","Brilliant."
"250","tt0184424","3889","1","Eddie Izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius, and this is Eddie at his very best."
"251","tt0184424","3889","2","His material is extremely witty and hilarious, and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage."
"252","tt0184424","3889","3","Instead of insulting the audience's intelligence, he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences, Hitler, the moon landing, and the British."
"253","tt0184424","3889","4","With so many memorable laughs, one can't help but repeat some of his lines."
"254","tt0184424","3889","5","Forever more, ""Do you have a flag."" should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine."
"255","tt0184424","3889","6","Every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see ""Dress to Kill""."
"256","tt0184424","3889","7","By far the best British standup comedian I've ever witnessed, Eddie Izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage."
"257","tt0184424","3889","8","However, his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he genuinely is."
"258","tt0184424","3889","9","""Dress to Kill"" is a treasure, one that luckily has found its way to home video, and can and should be enjoyed again and again."
"259","tt0184424","3890","1","This is an excellent stand up DVD!"
"260","tt0184424","3890","2","Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I have seen in years."
"261","tt0184424","3890","3","His routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it."
"262","tt0184424","3890","4","I HIGHLY recommend this one."
"263","tt0184424","3890","5","The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow, but the ending jokes in French are quite good, because you don't have to speak French to get it although if you do, it is still hilarious."
"264","tt0184424","3890","6","Also, the parts about being a transvestite are quite good."
"265","tt0184424","3890","7","The first scene about San Francisco is not great, but funny the first time."
"266","tt0184424","3890","8","Skip over those if you can."
"267","tt0184424","3890","9","It's almost not worth watching."
"268","tt0184424","3890","10","However, this really is a funny, funny stand up show that everyone should see."
"269","tt0184424","3890","11","""I was dead at the time!"""
"270","tt0184424","3891","1","One of the best comedians ever."
"271","tt0184424","3891","2","I've seen this show about 10 times and will probably watch it at least 100 more."
"272","tt0184424","3891","3","My friends and family quote from this DVD so often, you'd think we did nothing other than watch it."
"273","tt0184424","3891","4","The beginning part about Alcatraz is a little bit slow, but either wade through it or zip on through to the part where Eddie is on stage."
"274","tt0184424","3891","5","Watch for the ""Cake or Death"" part Joking about the Church of England and the ""Hitler/Pol Pot"" part Hard to explain, just watch it."
"275","tt0184424","3891","6","The best part of the show may be Eddie's facial expressions."
"276","tt0184424","3891","7","He can really say a lot with his eyes."
"277","tt0184424","3891","8","Mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow probably help, huh."
"278","tt0184424","3891","9","Fair warning: Eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of four letter words in."
"279","tt0184424","3892","1","Right, then, he's absolutely brilliant."
"280","tt0184424","3892","2","But you must be intelligent and quick to understand his humor."
"281","tt0184424","3892","3","He covers attacks. all sorts of topics, such as the first moon landing, Easter/Christmas, transvestitism, movies, and Herr Doktor Heimlich."
"282","tt0184424","3892","4","For those of you are averse to swearing, this isn't for you."
"283","tt0184424","3892","5","While some of us punctuate with commas and periods, he uses the f word."
"284","tt0184424","3892","6","Also, if you can't laugh at yourself, never watch this; you will feel the fool."
"285","tt0184424","3892","7","Incidentally, I've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live, and this is by far his best work."
"286","tt0184424","3892","8","He simply shines."
"287","tt0184424","3892","9","What might go so far as to say he is Glorious."
"288","tt0184424","3893","1","What more could anyone want."
"289","tt0184424","3893","2","He's a history lesson, foreign language tutor, NRA representative and ambassador to Burundi dressed in a nice silk frock and heels."
"290","tt0184424","3893","3","I laughed so hard I left a puddle."
"291","tt0184424","3893","4","His woes about puberty, transvestism, public school, and done in several languages made the absolute finest stand up routine I have ever seen."
"292","tt0184424","3893","5","I think about it now, years later when I see cake tea and cake or death and hear something translated into French the mouse is under the table, the cat is on the chair and the monkey is on the branch."
"293","tt0184424","3893","6","I like his versions of what Jerry Dorsey could have been named before he settled on Englebert Humperdinck."
"294","tt0184424","3893","7","I really hope to see a lot more from this wonderful guy."
"295","tt0184424","3893","8","He has a lot to teach us, and a wonderful way of telling it."
"296","tt0184424","3893","9","Thanks for your time."
"297","tt0184424","3894","1","I wish I could laugh again as much as when I saw this show for the first time."
"298","tt0184424","3894","2","I have not done so ever since."
"299","tt0184424","3894","3","The strange thing is, I find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again, and again."
"300","tt0184424","3894","4","Eddie Izzard is cultivated, is poignant, is a man of the world."
"301","tt0184424","3894","5","He is deft talking about politics and yet feels no need to ""engage"" in political discussion."
"302","tt0184424","3894","6","He is above that."
"303","tt0184424","3894","7","I would contrast him to George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his ideas, and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain."
"304","tt0184424","3894","8","Funniest guy on Earth"
"305","tt0184424","3895","1","A bit of Trivia b/c I can't figure out how to submit Trivia: In the backdrop of this performance, one of the images isGeorge Serat's ""A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte"" painting seen best in chapter 18, this painting is the subject of a Sonheim musical Sunday in the Park with George."
"306","tt0184424","3895","2","A bit of Trivia b/c I can't figure out how to submit Trivia: In the backdrop of this performance, one of the images isGeorge Serat's ""A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte"" painting seen best in chapter 18, this painting is the subject of a Sonheim musical Sunday in the Park with George."
"307","tt0184424","3896","1","Some people loved ""The Aristocrats"" and others hated it, frequently walking out in the middle."
"308","tt0184424","3896","2","Reactions to Eddie Izzard aren't likely to be that extreme if you can handle a transvestite comedian who says he likes girls and has a vocabulary that makes, shall we say, enough use of the ""f"" word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television."
"309","tt0184424","3896","3","Many of Izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances."
"310","tt0184424","3896","4","On the other hand, I thought this show was occasionally flatter than Izzard's chest but also more often than not funny and, in spots, absolutely hilarious."
"311","tt0184424","3896","5","He has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines."
"312","tt0184424","3896","6","He's not a story teller."
"313","tt0184424","3896","7","He's not a joke maker."
"314","tt0184424","3896","8","He's not a frenetic fantasist like Robin Williams."
"315","tt0184424","3896","9","He plays around with ideas, some of which work and some of which a routine with the San Francisco cable car and Alcatraz, for instance are completely unfunny."
"316","tt0184424","3896","10","He has a way, however, of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect."
"317","tt0184424","3896","11","I gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8."
"318","tt0184424","3896","12","But a 10."
"319","tt0184424","3896","13","No way."
"320","tt0184424","3897","1","This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard."
"321","tt0184424","3897","2","We had several friends over one night and for some reason or another had channel surfed to HBO during the course of the evening."
"322","tt0184424","3897","3","Someone by the name of ""Eddie Izzard"" was on."
"323","tt0184424","3897","4","I tried not to laugh too loudly at the first few jokes."
"324","tt0184424","3897","5","I didn't want to be held ""responsible"" for the rest of the group's enjoyment of something that was obviously killing me."
"325","tt0184424","3897","6","After holding in my laughs for more than was healthful, I let go as did the others of uswe were not stoned, by the way, nor talking of insurance and pensions...."
"326","tt0184424","3897","7","We were asphyxiated after that."
"327","tt0184424","3897","8","The story lines, the plot, the bizarre yet ingenious connections throughout the sketches are nothing short of brilliance."
"328","tt0184424","3897","9","I have since been addicted to every Eddie Izzard piece of comedy I can get my hands on."
"329","tt0184424","3897","10","His work is sheer genius."
"330","tt0184424","3897","11","His comedy appears effortless."
"331","tt0184424","3897","12","He seems more like that hysterically funny friend hanging out at your house and rambling on about this or that..."
"332","tt0184424","3897","13","It's convulsively funny."
"333","tt0184424","3897","14","He gives you the impression that the joke is between you .. and himself, the only true aficionados of humor, after all."
"334","tt0184424","3897","15","If you are disappointed in this video, you have no sense of the penultimate in humor or humour, as they say in the UK."
"335","tt0184424","3898","1","Hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind genuine tour de Star Wars force Luke: how strong."
"336","tt0184424","3898","2","Vader: the strength of a small pony, in which, being the master he is, he doesn't even break a sweat, ingeniously sparing himself mascara leakage.. and that's with almost 2 hours of whirling his way thru history, its birthplace, Europe, and more."
"337","tt0184424","3898","3","From Heimlich's middle of the night, ""I've invented a maneuver!"""
"338","tt0184424","3898","4","to the British Empire's ""..do you have a flag..."" and ancient deadbeat gods, ""Jeff!"
"339","tt0184424","3898","5","The God of Biscuits!"""
"340","tt0184424","3898","6","and many more, this is fish flop on the floor to jumpstart your lungs funny."
"341","tt0184424","3898","7","And I confess to having passed on this video dozens of times over the years, seeing as a British transvestite standup, vogueing on a chair, is one longshot of a rental after all, especially one going back 10 years now."
"342","tt0184424","3898","8","And yet, the material is not only timeless but almost oracular, turning present day into nothing more than an amplified, funnier/sadder version of where we were at a decade ago, although come to think about it, that may just be a coincidence."
"343","tt0184424","3899","1","This is another gem of a stand up show from Eddie Izzard ."
"344","tt0184424","3899","2","You cannot fail to laugh at the wide range of topics he talks about."
"345","tt0184424","3899","3","He even takes the piss out of his American audiance at times and most of them didnt even realise it!"
"346","tt0184424","3899","4","A must see for anybody who likes comedians. 9 out of 10."
"347","tt0184424","3900","1","This is right up at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows I've ever seen."
"348","tt0184424","3900","2","I laughed so hard, I'm sure I missed half the jokes."
"349","tt0184424","3900","3","This showcases Izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is."
"350","tt0184424","3900","4","What I particularly like is that he seems never to be ""dumbing down"" the material for his audience."
"351","tt0184424","3900","5","His timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags."
"352","tt0184424","3900","6","Thumbs way up."
"353","tt0184424","3901","1","This video rocked!"
"354","tt0184424","3901","2","Eddie is one of the funniest comics I have ever seen."
"355","tt0184424","3901","3","Not only does he have class, he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture that I have ever seen."
"356","tt0184424","3901","4","Eddie is the most original and most intelligent comic I've seen in a VERY long time."
"357","tt0184424","3901","5","Tell all those other stand ups to get off the stage and let this ""executive"" reign!"
"358","tt0184424","3902","1","I'd heard of Eddie Izzard, but had never seen him in action."
"359","tt0184424","3902","2","I knew he was a transvestite, and when I saw he was on HBO one night last summer, I put it on, not knowing how my husband would react."
"360","tt0184424","3902","3","Well, he blew us away."
"361","tt0184424","3902","4","He's better than Robin Williams ever was."
"362","tt0184424","3902","5","He has total control of the audience; when he does the 'Englebert is dead no he's not', routine, the audience doesn't know what to think by the end."
"363","tt0184424","3902","6","God as James Mason is also an inspired touch, and his version of the Python Spanish Inquisition as carried out by the Church of England 'Cake or Death.' is priceless."
"364","tt0184424","3902","7","My jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show."
"365","tt0184424","3902","8","We scoured the TV listings for months after that to be able to see him again, and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on."
"366","tt0184424","3902","9","If you get the chance to see this show, cancel everything and tape it, you won't be disappointed."
"367","tt0184424","3903","1","Stumbling upon this HBO special late one night, I was absolutely taken by this attractive British ""executive transvestite."""
"368","tt0184424","3903","2","I have never laughed so hard over European History or any of the other completely worthwhile point Eddie Izzard made."
"369","tt0184424","3903","3","I laughed so much that I woke up my mother sleeping at the other end of the house..."
"370","tt0184424","3904","1","In my opinion, this is the best stand up show I have ever seen."
"371","tt0184424","3904","2","I became an instant Eddie fan after seeing Dress to Kill, but I must say I think this is his best work."
"372","tt0184424","3904","3","I would say, though, if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live."
"373","tt0184424","3904","4","It is worth it!"
"374","tt0184424","3904","5","Most of the time after seeing a stand up routine a couple times, the jokes start to get old."
"375","tt0184424","3904","6","But I have to say, I've seen this show SO many times that I literally have the entire thing memorized which yes, I realize is kinda sad but every joke still makes me laugh."
"376","tt0184424","3904","7","This is truly a feel good show."
"377","tt0184424","3904","8","Dress to Kill will never get old for me."
"378","tt0184424","3904","9","I own it and watch it anytime I need a good laugh."
"379","tt0184424","3905","1","witty. funny. intelligent. awesome. i was flipping channels late one night years ago. came across this and a wildfire started. i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know. a few. like 3 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this didn't think it was as awesome as i did. the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. run don't walk. watch this and enjoy. intelligence and humor. it's a win win situation. i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of....sanechaos."
"380","tt0184424","3906","1","This has to be the funniest stand up comedy I have ever seen."
"381","tt0184424","3906","2","Eddie Izzard is a genius, he picks in Brits, Americans and everyone in between."
"382","tt0184424","3906","3","His style is completely natural and completely hilarious."
"383","tt0184424","3906","4","I doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a off."
"384","tt0184424","3906","5","Watch, enjoy, it's funny."
"385","tt0184424","3907","1","I find myself comparing all stand up acts to this one performance now."
"386","tt0184424","3907","2","Even older recorded performances I once thought were funny just don't seem as funny after seeing Eddie Izzard in this award winning look at history, language disparities, and Englebert Humperdink..."
"387","tt0184424","3908","1","I had no idea that Mr."
"388","tt0184424","3908","2","Izzard was so damn funny, It really boggles the mind that he is not more well known!"
"389","tt0184424","3908","3","His command over the crowd and his timing is perfect."
"390","tt0184424","3908","4","The monologue about Star Wars will kill ya too!"
"391","tt0184424","3908","5","If only all the stand up performers had his wit..."
"392","tt0184424","3909","1","I love Eddie Izzard."
"393","tt0184424","3909","2","I think this is awesome, and the other television specials should be looked at as well."
"394","tt0184424","3909","3","He has a good book ""Dress To Kill"" out to buy as well, which I think people should read."
"395","tt0184424","3909","4","I loved that this program won an Emmy, and anyone who likes history will probably get a laugh from Eddie."
"396","tt0184424","3909","5","Enjoy :"
"397","tt0184424","3910","1","So I'm at home, flipping channels one night, and I come across this man wearing heels and makeup, standing in front of a colored background on HBO."
"398","tt0184424","3910","2","Naturally, I did a double take and decided I'd watch for a little while."
"399","tt0184424","3910","3","I didn't change the channel until he was finished, it was so incredibly hilarious."
"400","tt0184424","3910","4","The next time it was on, I made sure to tape it so I could watch it over and over again, and it has remained one of my favorite things to watch."
"401","tt0184424","3910","5","During the first couple of minutes, you can tell that the audience isn't quite sure what to think, but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit."
"402","tt0184424","3910","6","While many stand up comedians mesh together in my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best."
"403","tt0184424","3910","7","His style is incredibly refreshing, and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events."
"404","tt0184424","3910","8","His show stayed with me afterwards."
"405","tt0184424","3910","9","I went to Italy over the summer, and all I could think about while I was there was how ""Italians are always on scooters going 'CIAO...'"" 10 out of 10."
"406","tt0184424","3910","10","See it."
"407","tt0184424","3910","11","You won't regret it."
"408","tt0184424","3911","1","Eddie Izzard is a one in a million comic genius."
"409","tt0184424","3911","2","He goes from squirrels to WWII to Stonehenge to religion to Englebert Humperdink and it's absolutely hilarious and it all makes sense!"
"410","tt0184424","3911","3","Get a copy of this now, you won't regret it!"
"411","tt0184424","3911","4","I give this an 11 out of 10."
"412","tt0215369","7390","1","My favorite part of this film was the old man's attempt to cure his neighbor's ills by putting the strong medicine in his bath."
"413","tt0215369","7390","2","There is more than a sense of family, there is a sense of community."
"414","tt0215369","7391","1","This delighted audiences at a number of film festivals, and it is not hard to see why."
"415","tt0215369","7391","2","Director Yang Zhang, with the help of some very nice work by the three principle actors, Xu Zhu as the father, Master Liu; Quanxin Pu as the elder son, Da Ming; and especially Wu Jiang as the irrepressible and lovable younger son, Er Ming, spins a tale that will warm the coldest heart."
"416","tt0215369","7391","3","The film starts with a man taking a shower in an automated booth in the middle of Beijing."
"417","tt0215369","7391","4","He puts some money in a slot, opens the door, takes off his clothes and puts some of them on a conveyor belt to be cleaned, steps into the shower and gets cleaned with brushes and squirts of water and soap as though he's a car at the car wash."
"418","tt0215369","7391","5","This is the future symbolically speaking, and the old bathhouse we will see in the next scene is the past."
"419","tt0215369","7391","6","Agrarian China is giving way to industrial China."
"420","tt0215369","7391","7","Pollution."
"421","tt0215369","7391","8","Cultural revolution hang over."
"422","tt0215369","7391","9","Industrialization blues."
"423","tt0215369","7391","10","No way."
"424","tt0215369","7391","11","What we have here is a celebration of people and their kindness and love for one another, a celebration of goodness in the hearts of men."
"425","tt0215369","7391","12","Yet I wonder how the Chinese government views this film."
"426","tt0215369","7391","13","On the one hand, it clearly presents a pleasant view of China and its people."
"427","tt0215369","7391","14","It is stringently nonpolitical without criticism of the present regime expressed or implied."
"428","tt0215369","7391","15","Yet there is the slightest sense that the good old ways are going to be replaced by something that may not be as good."
"429","tt0215369","7391","16","I think Yang Zhang had the wisdom to just let that be as it may."
"430","tt0215369","7391","17","Tell a story about old men at the bathhouse where they get back rubs and massages, where they tell tall tales and reminisce about the good old days, where they can relax and play Chinese chess and stage cricket fights, where the Master is a spry and wise old guy and his assistant is his son, who may be retarded or autistic, but who does his job with glee and an infectious spirit of fun and good will."
"431","tt0215369","7391","18","Enter back on the scene the older son, Da Ming, who is polished, well groomed and taciturn."
"432","tt0215369","7391","19","He is uncomfortable with what he sees as the unsophisticated behavior of his father and brother."
"433","tt0215369","7391","20","He represents modern China with his tie and his briefcase, his cell phone and his education."
"434","tt0215369","7391","21","He has only returned because he thought his father was dying."
"435","tt0215369","7391","22","When he sees that this is not true, he packs his bags and is set to return to his wife and his career."
"436","tt0215369","7391","23","But then a crisis ensues and it is during this crisis that Da Ming sees the value of the natural, people centered life that his father and his brother have been living."
"437","tt0215369","7391","24","And so Yang Zhang reconciles the old and the new, and does so in such a charming manner that I will not object, especially since his style is so neat and so carefully expressed."
"438","tt0215369","7391","25","One of the nice things he does that I miss in most movies is the way he dovetails the subplots within the larger story so that they are resolved before the picture ends."
"439","tt0215369","7391","26","The bathhouse regular who sings ""O sole mio"" in the bathhouse as the water showers down upon him, much to the delight of Er Ming, finds that he can't sing in public because of stage fright."
"440","tt0215369","7391","27","Near the end of the film he loses his stage fright and sings thanks to some inspired help from Er Ming."
"441","tt0215369","7391","28","And the bathhouse regular who is losing his wife because...well, he tells a tale to Master Liu before he confesses the real reason."
"442","tt0215369","7391","29","But Liu understands and again before the movie is over, husband and wife are reconciled."
"443","tt0215369","7391","30","This kind of ""happy ending"" movie making is unusual in today artistic and international films, or in almost any film directed at adults."
"444","tt0215369","7391","31","Some happy endings are so contrived as to embarrass not only their contrivers but their audiences."
"445","tt0215369","7391","32","And some are so blatantly condescending that the audience is offended."
"446","tt0215369","7391","33","Here however the audience is delighted."
"447","tt0215369","7391","34","See this especially for the comedic performance by Wu Jiang whose warm effervescence overcomes any handicap his character may have."
"448","tt0215369","7392","1","I like this film a lot."
"449","tt0215369","7392","2","It has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is pretty universal, the story of the prodigal son."
"450","tt0215369","7392","3","The aspect I like the best however was the way that the bath house was more than just a background for the story."
"451","tt0215369","7392","4","As the father told the son the story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of china, the element of water and bathing becomes an almost sacred ritual."
"452","tt0215369","7392","5","Water was so scarce that a simple bath had profound depth and meaning."
"453","tt0215369","7392","6","Overall the film was very effective."
"454","tt0215369","7392","7","There were moments, however, when it verged on ""too"" sweet...bordering on cloying during the park recital scene."
"455","tt0215369","7392","8","But overall, I highly recommend this film."
"456","tt0215369","7393","1","This movie was an impressive one."
"457","tt0215369","7393","2","My first experience with a foreign film, it was neither too long, nor too complex."
"458","tt0215369","7393","3","I myself enjoyed the subtitles; and the plot was surprisingly fresh."
"459","tt0215369","7393","4","The story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and retarded brother after a long separation appeared cliched at first, but it proved to be very touching and realistic."
"460","tt0215369","7393","5","There was also some subtle humor so as not to depress or bore the audience."
"461","tt0215369","7394","1","This Chinese movie made me feel so many similarities with members of a culture I don't belong and are far from."
"462","tt0215369","7394","2","In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps one to relate to each character, and to the happiness of doing the simple routine things."
"463","tt0215369","7394","3","All actors are brilliant, and Xu Hzu exudes kindness and wisdom, yet also vulnerable and mean."
"464","tt0215369","7394","4","Er Min, the retarded brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes to and from the most disparate persons in this universe."
"465","tt0215369","7394","5","A different China, this is far from the Chinese realism, yet, it has lots of humanity and realism of a different kind."
"466","tt0215369","7394","6","Get it."
"467","tt0215369","7394","7","You won't be disappointed."
"468","tt0215369","7395","1","Almost the entire film takes place in a public bathhouse in China."
"469","tt0215369","7395","2","There are no fancy sets, explosion or glamorous people only fine writing, acting and direction Hollywood, take note!."
"470","tt0215369","7395","3","An estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying."
"471","tt0215369","7395","4","He is surprised to see that Dad looks fine and is going about running the family business as usual."
"472","tt0215369","7395","5","In fact, he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop!"
"473","tt0215369","7395","6","Dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and doesn't really see the value of the old bathhouse."
"474","tt0215369","7395","7","How their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believable."
"475","tt0215369","7395","8","I was happy to see that not every Chinese movie is an action picture such as those starring Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, as I don't particularly care for these frenetic films."
"476","tt0215369","7395","9","The Shower as well as Springtime In A Small Town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese films about PEOPLE!"
"477","tt0215369","7396","1","Another outstanding foreign film which thoroughly trounces the never ending crop of crud emanating from Hollywood!"
"478","tt0215369","7396","2","This is a story of life and living."
"479","tt0215369","7396","3","No, definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in the totally artificial Hollywood movies but rather, the real life complete with real characters each with strengths and weaknesses just like real people in our lives and ourselves."
"480","tt0215369","7396","4","The dynamics of all of these lives, intertwined within the walls of this bathhouse, and particularly its aged owner, are magnificent, heart touching and highly thought provoking."
"481","tt0215369","7396","5","Sit back, relax, and be carried away into the simple and beautiful life."
"482","tt0215369","7396","6","There is real wisdom to be learned in this movie if you only open yourself up to it."
"483","tt0215369","7396","7","You will not be disappointed."
"484","tt0215369","7397","1","""Xizao"", is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions, and its effects on a family in China."
"485","tt0215369","7397","2","Da Ming Quanxiu Pu, is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming Wu Jiang makes him believe that his father Liu Xu Zhu, has died."
"486","tt0215369","7397","3","He founds that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business, the public bathroom."
"487","tt0215369","7397","4","The movie centers around Da Ming's family, and how he has to learn the importance of his father's job, something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon."
"488","tt0215369","7397","5","Also, the movie explores his relationship with Er Ming, who is mentally challenged, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies, but also their souls."
"489","tt0215369","7397","6","The two main themes of the movie, the family and the problems of progress, are incredibly well handled, and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make, both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of Chinese society and customs."
"490","tt0215369","7397","7","The director, Yang Zhang, tells his tale in a simple way, letting the characters characters do the job."
"491","tt0215369","7397","8","It is a very simple approach, but it fits the movie perfectly, and I highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good."
"492","tt0215369","7397","9","Zhang has enormous potential, as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks."
"493","tt0215369","7397","10","The acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed."
"494","tt0215369","7397","11","The three lead characters give remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming surely steals the show."
"495","tt0215369","7397","12","Even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing ""old days were much better"" message, instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium, like saying that progress is good, and we must move on, but we must not forget where we came from, and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old."
"496","tt0215369","7397","13","An awesome, and touching film."
"497","tt0215369","7397","14","8/10"
"498","tt0215369","7398","1","Xizao is a rare little movie."
"499","tt0215369","7398","2","It is simple and undemanding, and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy."
"500","tt0215369","7398","3","The story is simple, and the theme of old and new clashing is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes."
"501","tt0215369","7398","4","This theme is the essence of the movie, but it would have fallen flat if it wasn't for the magnificent characters and the actors portraying them."
"502","tt0215369","7398","5","The aging patriarch, Master Liu, is a relic of China's pre expansion days."
"503","tt0215369","7398","6","He runs a bath house in an old neighbourhood."
"504","tt0215369","7398","7","Every single scene set in the bath house is a source of jelaousy for us stressed out, unhappy people."
"505","tt0215369","7398","8","Not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful setting."
"506","tt0215369","7398","9","Master Liu's mentally handicapped son Er Ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie, coupled with his modern life brother."
"507","tt0215369","7398","10","The interactions between these three people, and the various visitors to the bath house, are amazingly detailed and heart felt, with some scenes packing so much emotion it's beyond almost everything seen in movies."
"508","tt0215369","7398","11","With its regime critical message, this movie was not only censored, but also given unreasonably small coverage."
"509","tt0215369","7398","12","It could be a coincidence, but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find, even on the internet!, you can't help getting suspicious."
"510","tt0215369","7398","13","So help free speech and the movie world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you happen to own the DVD, if there even is one, then share share share!"
"511","tt0215369","7399","1","My choice for greatest movie ever used to be Laughton's ""Night of the Hunter"" which remains superb in my canon."
"512","tt0215369","7399","2","But, it may have been supplanted by ""Shower"" which is the most artistically Daoist movie I have seen."
"513","tt0215369","7399","3","The way that caring for others is represented by the flowing of water, and the way that water can be made inspiration, and comfort, and cleansing, and etc. is the essence of the Dao."
"514","tt0215369","7399","4","It is possible to argue that the the NOFTH and Shower themes are similar, and that Lillian Gish in the former represents the purest form of Christianity as the operators of the bathhouse represent the purest form of Daoism."
"515","tt0215369","7399","5","I would not in any way argue against such an interpretation."
"516","tt0215369","7399","6","Both movies are visual joys in their integration of idea and image."
"517","tt0215369","7399","7","Yet, Shower presents such an unstylized view of the sacredness of everyday life that I give it the nod."
"518","tt0215369","7399","8","I revere both."
"519","tt0215369","7400","1","This is a great story of family loyalty which, thankfully, doesn't resort to the usual tricks or at least the ones I'm used to seeing in American and European films of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension."
"520","tt0215369","7400","2","It's very watchable and very lovable."
"521","tt0215369","7400","3","It has some beautiful cinematography, but doesn't rely on that alone to entertain."
"522","tt0215369","7401","1","I found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators, i.e. chinese."
"523","tt0215369","7401","2","It becomes a story about values, and causes the watcher to reevaluate their own choices in life, and loyalties toward institutions."
"524","tt0215369","7401","3","Amazingly enough, it managed to do this in a gentle, mildly humorous manner, which only in retrospect seens threatening to one's status quo."
"525","tt0215369","7401","4","I enjoyed the movie, and would watch it again if I could."
"526","tt0215369","7402","1","For a movie with a plot like this I would normally smell ""tearjerker"" in the first ten minutes and turn it off, but this was very well made, with emotional subtleties, great acting, and some genuinely funny moments."
"527","tt0215369","7402","2","It was also interesting to see a different culture a vanishing one at that."
"528","tt0215369","7402","3","My wife and I both dug it!"
"529","tt0215369","7403","1","Like another reviewer said, this movie is not a heavy melodrama, but it deals with harsh realities."
"530","tt0215369","7403","2","A very very playful movie that does not dwell for a moment."
"531","tt0215369","7403","3","Some very good acting and some wonderful smiles as well."
