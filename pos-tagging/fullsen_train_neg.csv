1,tt0089280,3074,1,Even for the cocaine laced 1980's this is a pathetic.
2,tt0089280,3074,2,"I don't understand why someone would want to waste celluloid, time, effort, money, and audience brain cells to make such drivel."
3,tt0089280,3074,3,"If your going to make a comedy, make it funny."
4,tt0089280,3074,4,If you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself.
5,tt0089280,3074,5,If you're going to release it as a joke like this: DON'T!!!
6,tt0089280,3074,6,"I mean, it was a joke right."
7,tt0089280,3074,7,Someone please tell me this was a joke. please.
8,tt0089280,3075,1,"Yep.. this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the MSTifyed movies, but I have definately seen worse."
9,tt0089280,3075,2,Think Gremlins rated R.
10,tt0089280,3075,3,"Well anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some sci fi convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at!"
11,tt0089280,3075,4,"It was one of those really low budget conventions, where everything goes, an everyone brought in something if you want to see crap, you should have of seen what some friends and I brought in."
12,tt0089280,3075,5,"He seemed like a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on Hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously, and said he loved the MST3K version!"
13,tt0089280,3075,6,"All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing."
14,tt0089280,3075,7,And I think was meant to bad like Mars Attacks.
15,tt0089280,3075,8,"So I guess I'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5, and betraying all my fellow MSTies."
16,tt0089280,3075,9,Sorry guys.
17,tt0089280,3076,1,This movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself.
18,tt0089280,3076,2,I think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage.
19,tt0089280,3076,3,"The main characters are the whiny non hero Kevin, Amy, his bratty, ungodly conservative girlfriend, Kyle, a dork in red shorts who enjoys phone sex, Daphne, a scrawny, horny girl who is supposed to be ""cool"" and has no sense of how to dress, and her oversexed boyfriend Nick, an army recruit who can make an innuendo out of anything."
20,tt0089280,3076,4,"No, I'm not a pervert, that's REALLY how the movie goes."
21,tt0089280,3076,5,"The movie itself is an over sexed rip off of 1986's Gremlins, only you'll never find a trace of Gizmo anywhere."
22,tt0089280,3076,6,"No, these Hobgoblins, unleashed by Wimpy Man I'm sorry, Kevin, make someone's wildest dreams come true, and then kill the victims."
23,tt0089280,3076,7,"Yes, you guessed it Eventually, they wind up in a strip club, where the nerdy Amy's greatest dream is revealed She wants to be a stripper!"
24,tt0089280,3076,8,"Look, I watched this flick via MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and Crow T."
25,tt0089280,3076,9,Robot making a laughing stock out of this cinematic trainwreck and it still made me bleed from both eyes.
26,tt0089280,3076,10,"Not really, but I wish I had."
27,tt0089280,3076,11,"I'm not giving you anymore plot, because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain."
28,tt0089280,3076,12,"Besides, it's not like there's a plot worth mentioning."
29,tt0089280,3076,13,They should put a Surgeon's General Warning on this film.
30,tt0089280,3077,1,Hobgoblins... what a concept.
31,tt0089280,3077,2,Rick Sloan was a master with this film.
32,tt0089280,3077,3,He had the brilliance to produce a film with actors that couldn't act.
33,tt0089280,3077,4,"On top of that, he chose to write a script based on some sort of bad acid trip gone serriously wrong."
34,tt0089280,3077,5,"Put it together, you end up with a film that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and vaccum cleaners."
35,tt0089280,3077,6,This movie was very painful.
36,tt0089280,3077,7,"The pain it caused is about equal to the pain caused by having your genitals carved out with a spoon, and then having the entire wound covered with salt and Hydrochloric acid."
37,tt0089280,3078,1,I didn't think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both fronts....really awful.
38,tt0089280,3078,2,"The fact that it doesn't take itself seriously usually a good thing works against it, primarily because the actors are so wooden you really would swear they are reading cue cards."
39,tt0089280,3078,3,"On the upshot though.....the MST3K version, as always, has a few laughs...."
40,tt0089280,3079,1,"My favorite quote from Crow was, when the car was going off the cliff, ""The movie is so bad, even the car wants to get out of it!"""
41,tt0089280,3079,2,This had to be the funniest movie I have ever seen.
42,tt0089280,3079,3,"It was seriously out there to scare you, which makes it even funnier!"
43,tt0089280,3079,4,If it weren't for Mystery Science Theater I wouldn't be here today! : P
44,tt0089280,3080,1,Hee hee hee.
45,tt0089280,3080,2,This movie is so bad that it doesn't even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time.
46,tt0089280,3080,3,I remember the day I first saw this on MST.
47,tt0089280,3080,4,"Sun was shining, looked like a good day. then, I saw this product of Rick Sloane which consisted of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the crappy 80s fest land."
48,tt0089280,3080,5,"Kevin, wussy extraordinaire, tries to impress his girlfriend, manages an assistant security guard job, fights with rakes, and plenty more stuff in this very badly made series of images."
49,tt0089280,3080,6,No plot or story is needed.
50,tt0089280,3080,7,Obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves.
51,tt0089280,3080,8,"An army guy and his sex crazed girl will make you wanna leap off a cliff, and the dorky friend who gets his kicks off phone sex will make you say, "" He has got some nice red shorts""."
52,tt0089280,3080,9,"Plus, I really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket cart."
53,tt0089280,3080,10,"Just when you think it's over, wait until the Club Scum scene."
54,tt0089280,3080,11,Ask for Road Rash.
55,tt0089280,3080,12,"I advise that after viewing this film, a good month to regain senses and sanity."
56,tt0089280,3080,13,"And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick to the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins."
57,tt0089280,3081,1,Good grief!
58,tt0089280,3081,2,"While I still maintain that Manos: The Hands of Fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, Hobgoblins came awfully close."
59,tt0089280,3081,3,This...this...thing insults the audience at every opportunity.
60,tt0089280,3081,4,"At least films like Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed on mst3k, this one was a struggle to get through."
61,tt0089280,3081,5,I was literally writhing on the couch in anguish.
62,tt0089280,3081,6,This thing managed to embarrass me alone!
63,tt0089280,3081,7,"Even if you are a die hard MST3K fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment, think twice about seeing this one."
64,tt0089280,3081,8,It's that bad.
65,tt0089280,3082,1,"Good Lord, what were they THINKING..!!!!!!"
66,tt0089280,3082,2,"Here is your spoiler warning, even though I don't think it'll really matter."
67,tt0089280,3082,3,You won't be seeing this piece of trash anyway.
68,tt0089280,3082,4,"A group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people, who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them, and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies."
69,tt0089280,3082,5,"In other words, the whole thing is really stupid."
70,tt0089280,3082,6,You KNOW it has to be bad when even Mike and the Bots can't save something!!
71,tt0089280,3082,7,And they didn't!
72,tt0089280,3082,8,"I know, some of their lines were funny, like what to add to the sign ""HIT"" and the hand comments, but, geez, this was pretty dang sad."
73,tt0089280,3082,9,All I can say is DO NOT WATCH THIS PIECE O CRUD.
74,tt0089280,3082,10,IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR EYES.
75,tt0089280,3083,1,...
76,tt0089280,3083,2,Bad at being intentionally bad...
77,tt0089280,3083,3,This little gem shot straight onto the MST3k big screen.
78,tt0089280,3083,4,"While it's obvious the movie isn't trying to be taken seriously Hopefully that their goal, anyway..., the movie is still plain bad."
79,tt0089280,3083,5,"Hell, it makes Leprechaun In Space look big budgeted..."
80,tt0089280,3083,6,In short: Paint my muscle car prune colored!
81,tt0089280,3084,1,this is the result.
82,tt0089280,3084,2,"A piece of trash movie that doesn't deserve to even be classified as a movie, it's just a bunch of stuff on a film reel, that makes no sense whatsoever."
83,tt0089280,3084,3,"Well back to the actors, which from the get go seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a little amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror film."
84,tt0089280,3084,4,"Well it's a great horror anyway, nevermind being a film."
85,tt0089280,3084,5,"There's plenty of horrific acting in ""Hobgoblins,"" but the worse is the main guy named Richard, who is just way too much of a weakling to even sorta root for."
86,tt0089280,3084,6,"Well, when you cast a bunch of friends and try to make the film scary, on a less than shoestring budget, no less, this is what will happen."
87,tt0089280,3084,7,Oh well at least the MST3K version was hilarious.
88,tt0089280,3084,8,"But this is still a horrid movie, that deserves all the bashing it gets. 9 for the MST version."
89,tt0089280,3085,1,"Description: Corny, utterly stupid and worthless."
90,tt0089280,3085,2,"It's so cheap and lame, it'll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget I'm guessing this... probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie."
91,tt0089280,3085,3,It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater.
92,tt0089280,3085,4,"I am giving you the best advice in the world:Spare yourself, spare your time, life, and money, by NOT I repeat, NOT even ponder about whether you should see this movie."
93,tt0089280,3085,5,"This movie is so corny, it'll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom."
94,tt0089280,3085,6,"If you have a one digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie."
95,tt0089280,3085,7,You might actually admire it.
96,tt0089280,3085,8,"Like I said before, IF you have a one digit IQWith about 12 actors of your own, a few puppets you bought at a garage sale, and of course cameras and music, I gaurentee you'll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap."
97,tt0089280,3086,1,"I once thought that ""The Stoned Age"" was the worst film ever made..."
98,tt0089280,3086,2,I was wrong.
99,tt0089280,3086,3,"""Hobgoblins"" surpassed it in every way I could imagine and a few I couldn't."
100,tt0089280,3086,4,"In ""The Stoned Age"" I hated the characters."
101,tt0089280,3086,5,"In ""Hobgoblins"" I hated the actors... and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity."
102,tt0089280,3086,6,"I won't include a teaser to this film, I'm not that cruel."
103,tt0089280,3086,7,I couldn't subject innocent people such as yourselves to such torment.
104,tt0089280,3086,8,"In fact, any discussion of plot pertaining to this film is senseless and demeaning."
105,tt0089280,3086,9,"Words I would use to describe this film are as follows: insipid, asinine, and ingenuous."
106,tt0089280,3086,10,"In conclusion, PLEASE don't watch this film."
107,tt0089280,3086,11,"I beg of you, from one movie lover to another... no, from one human being to another, PLEASE."
108,tt0089280,3086,12,For the sake of your own sanity and intellect DO NOT WATCH IT.
109,tt0089280,3086,13,Destroy any copies you come across.
110,tt0089280,3087,1,A group of extremely unlikable A holes are tormented by lame puppets that some elderly douche bag night watchman has kept locked away in a film vault for twenty years for no reason whatsoever.
111,tt0089280,3087,2,Many people know this film merely from MST3K's spot on ribbing of the flick.
112,tt0089280,3087,3,"But I've seen the actual movie and can safely say that yes it's bad, really, REALLY bad."
113,tt0089280,3087,4,"From the one of the most awful 'fight' scenes I've ever witnessed to the stuffed toy 'aliens' that suffer from a lack of motion I had a My Pet Monster that was scarier right up to the atrocious acting I had a My Pet Monster that was more charismatic However, that being said Rick Sloan's ""Vice Academy"" films are somehow, and trust me I have no earthly idea how, much worse."
114,tt0089280,3087,5,"That's not to suggest that this film is anything but crap, because it isn't."
115,tt0089280,3087,6,Just throwing it out there.
116,tt0089280,3087,7,"Eye Candy: no nudity in the movie proper, but there's 2 pairs of tits in the DVD Introduction to the film My Grade: D Retromedia DVD Extras: Introduction by Jim Wynorski; Stills gallery; and Trailer for this film"
117,tt0089280,3088,1,1
118,tt0089280,3088,2,"Aliens resemble plush toys and hand puppets, while having arms that don't function.2."
119,tt0089280,3088,3,"Aliens mastered intergalactic space travel, but they don't know how to push an unlocked vault door open, yet can push open a door being held shut by five people.3."
120,tt0089280,3088,4,"Old Security Guards know how to get a hold of C4, and are just waiting for the right time to use it, say, when they are suddenly fired for no explainable reason.4."
121,tt0089280,3088,5,"Apparently, US Army boot camp, in the 80's, involved several sessions of ""garden tool combat"", including the pirouette spin of death.5."
122,tt0089280,3088,6,"To impress your prudish girl friend, you have to ""save the world...err...neighborhood"" from aliens.6."
123,tt0089280,3088,7,"All women are sluts, either openly or secretly.7."
124,tt0089280,3088,8,Scummy night clubs look like bad diners.8.
125,tt0089280,3088,9,"""Scummy"" waitresses double as dancers for The Fontanelles how did they get talked into this. who can only do bad 60's dance moves.9."
126,tt0089280,3088,10,Army privates secretly dream of being Rambo.10.
127,tt0089280,3088,11,"Grenades apparently have a setting for ""flash bang""."
128,tt0089280,3088,12,11
129,tt0089280,3088,13,Being burned alive apparently only leaves one with minor burns on their arms.12.
130,tt0089280,3088,14,US Army Staff Sargeants apparently happen to always be in the area and do nothing about aliens in the area.13.
131,tt0089280,3088,15,"Aliens apparently always ""go home"", which means back to the vault they were un locked in.14."
132,tt0089280,3088,16,"Aliens are attracted to bright lights, which apparently means in the Los Angeles area one would assume, the protagonist's house is the most brightly lit thing in the area.15."
133,tt0089280,3088,17,Showing 16 parking scenes in a movie makes the audience clamor for more.16.
134,tt0089280,3088,18,Vans from the 80's apparently have horrible suspension systems.17.
135,tt0089280,3088,19,Comedy is supposed to happen in this film.18.
136,tt0089280,3088,20,Horror is supposed to happen in this film.19.
137,tt0089280,3088,21,Spoofs and homages are supposed to happen in this film.20.
138,tt0089280,3088,22,This film cures insomnia.21.
139,tt0089280,3088,23,"Apparently, garden tools make electronic keyboard noises whenever they are used, not just in fights tell me I'm not the only one who noticed this."
140,tt0089280,3088,24,The simply truth is this film just came out wrong.
141,tt0089280,3088,25,Period.
142,tt0089280,3088,26,"There isn't much meat on the bone, nor does it do anything really well."
143,tt0089280,3088,27,Even average.
144,tt0089280,3088,28,It's just bad.
145,tt0089280,3088,29,"However, I've seen far worse, and the rake fight scene is pure comedy gold, intentional or otherwise.2/10 Jaws 4 was worse then this."
146,tt0089280,3088,30,At least the film never took itself seriously.
147,tt0089280,3089,1,"This movie is so bad, it's comical."
148,tt0089280,3089,2,"In fact, Mystery Science Theatre 3000, the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this very film to mock."
149,tt0089280,3089,3,I suggest watching it maybe on YouTube instead of actually seeing this movie.
150,tt0089280,3089,4,"Please, do not see Hobgoblins if you're not prepared to stop within the first scene."
151,tt0089280,3089,5,"Actually, do not see this movie, period."
152,tt0089280,3089,6,Please.
153,tt0089280,3089,7,At least not seriously.
154,tt0089280,3089,8,"Its jokes are not funny to say the least, and you'll have much more fun parodying or watching a parody of it then viewing the movie."
155,tt0089280,3089,9,"You may feel yourself becoming sick upon watching, so spare yourself."
156,tt0089280,3089,10,Read a book.
157,tt0089280,3089,11,Do the laundry.
158,tt0089280,3089,12,Anything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
159,tt0089280,3090,1,I really don't have anything new to add but I just felt like I had to comment on this sack.
160,tt0089280,3090,2,So here goes:Atrocious.
161,tt0089280,3090,3,I'm running through my MST3K DVD collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for about the 10th time.
162,tt0089280,3090,4,"It's really, really painful but it was next on the list..."
163,tt0089280,3090,5,"You can see that there is a tiny kernel of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is ""Hobgoblins"" but it just couldn't get out."
164,tt0089280,3090,6,Everything about this movie is 4th rate.
165,tt0089280,3090,7,"The story, the acting, the effects, the women, the ""action scenes"", the... ahhhh forget it."
166,tt0089280,3090,8,"I can watch a piece of crap like ""The Bloodwaters of Dr."
167,tt0089280,3090,9,"Z"" aka ""Zaat"" over and over and over with hardly any ill effects I like it in fact btw, it will be on TCM later this month October, 2009 but ""Hobgoblins"" is a whole 'nother ballgame."
168,tt0089280,3090,10,"The worst part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medications, and yet the ersatz ""New Wave"" dance music that Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman were frolicking to in the living room is STILL RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD."
169,tt0089280,3090,11,This torment will last for days.
170,tt0089280,3090,12,"Good luck, won't you."
171,tt0089280,3091,1,Hobgoblins is a very cheap and badly done Gremlins rip off.
172,tt0089280,3091,2,That's the best thing one can say about this stinkpile.
173,tt0089280,3091,3,Pretty much everyone in the cast was chosen for their looks and not their acting ability.
174,tt0089280,3091,4,It was very painful to watch.
175,tt0089280,3091,5,Avoid this one at all costs.
176,tt0089280,3092,1,"If movies like Ghoulies rip off Gremlins, then Hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like Ghoulies."
177,tt0089280,3092,2,"These barely animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies which involve basically groteque characters' sex dreams oh joy, but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess, except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica."
178,tt0089280,3092,3,"They show this down in the 8th circle of Hell, one suspects."
179,tt0089280,3092,4,"There's no real plot just ""goblins kill!"""
180,tt0089280,3092,5,and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience.
181,tt0089280,3093,1,"Whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the MST3K version, you can only be impressed by the utter GALL that went into this production."
182,tt0089280,3093,2,The filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so.
183,tt0089280,3093,3,Everything about it is rock bottom cheap.
184,tt0089280,3093,4,Even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard.
185,tt0089280,3093,5,"The ""hobgoblins"" are, as you probably know, ""realized"" with badly crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys; when a person is supposed to be attacked by them, it's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body."
186,tt0089280,3093,6,"When the critters scurry away from the two security guards, this is shown or rather, not shown by the camera aiming UP at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past."
187,tt0089280,3093,7,"It's reminiscent of the scene in the film ""Tangents"" where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world, surveying the wreckage, and we aren't shown any of it."
188,tt0089280,3093,8,"Budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing, so why try."
189,tt0089280,3093,9,"The ""sets"" were utterly laughable."
190,tt0089280,3093,10,"""Club Scum"" was an obvious diner; the house appears to have been a vacant house probably for rent or sale which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot."
191,tt0089280,3093,11,"The ""spacecraft"" is something I would have been ashamed to build when I was a model making 10 year old."
192,tt0089280,3093,12,"The motivations of the characters make no sense Kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he hasn't made her ""proud of him."""
193,tt0089280,3093,13,"I'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end, but any guy with real self respect would have told her to go to hell and left her."
194,tt0089280,3093,14,"Nick is supposedly back from 2 months of Army training yeah, nice regulation haircut, Nick, and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic, moronic animals who are sex maniacs."
195,tt0089280,3093,15,"Kyle is a phone sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex clad dominatrix type, but he's so effeminate that he's more likely gay than not."
196,tt0089280,3093,16,One of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze.
197,tt0089280,3093,17,And the hobgoblins.
198,tt0089280,3093,18,At the end they all head back to the vault where they've lived for 30 years.
199,tt0089280,3093,19,Why.
200,tt0089280,3093,20,Who knows.
201,tt0089280,3093,21,Who cares.
202,tt0089280,3093,22,"Watch this film and be amazed at how primitive film making in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script, incompetent direction, actors who are so bad they'd be rejected from a high school theater production, and sets worthy of Edward D."
203,tt0089280,3093,23,"Wood, Jr."
204,tt0089280,3094,1,"MINOR SPOILERS As a bad movie connoisseur I must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet ""Hobgoblins"" stands apart from all others in it's own unique way."
205,tt0089280,3094,2,"Classic baddies such as ""The Creeping Terror,"" ""The Mighty Gorga"" and ""Manos"" are uniformly bad from start to finish."
206,tt0089280,3094,3,"""Hobgoblins"" on the other hand, starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes."
207,tt0089280,3094,4,During my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene I thought to myself that this was a truly bad film.
208,tt0089280,3094,5,I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this movie had to offer.
209,tt0089280,3094,6,"The movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept ""Club Scum"" sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another."
210,tt0089280,3094,7,"With just this one film, director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time."
211,tt0089280,3094,8,How bad can a bad movie be.
212,tt0089280,3094,9,"Watch ""Hobgoblins"" and wonder no longer."
213,tt0089280,3095,1,"Wow, I just finally managed, after several attempts, to finish watching this god awful movie, only to learn that Rick Sloane and his production team have completed a straight to video sequel this year."
214,tt0089280,3095,2,"Of all movies reviewed by MST3K and they truly dig from the bottom of the barrel, screening the reputationally bad 'Manos,' 'Werewolf,' 'The Incredibly Strange,' and the lesser know disasters like 'Laserblast,' 'Zombie Nightmare,' and 'Time Chasers,' this certainly has to be the absolute biggest pile of garbage they'd ever shown which makes it perfect for riffing."
215,tt0089280,3095,3,"Very simple, the movie is about a bunch of Munchies like gremlins on the loose, exploiting people's desires for fame, fortune, prowess, and of course, sex in ways that end up with people getting killed."
216,tt0089280,3095,4,"But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools, the writing is so forced such as the oft described scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it, if only she turned her head a quarter to the left... and this isn't the first time in the movie this happens, and the story is so... rarely given attention hence the MST3K riff about a ""law in the future where films have to be made by FILMmakers, that you actually root for the furry puppets to kill off everyone on screen."
217,tt0089280,3095,5,Worst movie... ever.
218,tt0089280,3096,1,"For starters, ""Hobgoblins"" tries to ape the more successful ""Gremlins""."
219,tt0089280,3096,2,That's bad enough but they don't even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here.
220,tt0089280,3096,3,"Instead, it's more like a bargain basement, everything must go clearance of embarrassing scenes, inappropriate sound FX, acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws 'em down the old tube aroo."
221,tt0089280,3096,4,The plot.
222,tt0089280,3096,5,Grrrr....
223,tt0089280,3096,6,Meddling kids track down gremlin like creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies.
224,tt0089280,3096,7,"Sound cool, does it."
225,tt0089280,3096,8,"Well, see that wall on the other side of your room."
226,tt0089280,3096,9,"Run right at it, top speed, face first."
227,tt0089280,3096,10,"See, THAT is cooler than this movie."
228,tt0089280,3096,11,You dare to doubt.
229,tt0089280,3096,12,"Quick, name something else one of the leads has been in other than this."
230,tt0089280,3096,13,"What other scripts have the writers done since ""Hobgoblins""."
231,tt0089280,3096,14,Name another Rick Sloane directoral effort.
232,tt0089280,3096,15,"How many ""Hobgoblins"" action figures do you have."
233,tt0089280,3096,16,See.
234,tt0089280,3096,17,THANK you.
235,tt0089280,3096,18,I cannot believe I took so long to write about such a horrible film.
236,tt0089280,3096,19,"I'd rather write about more important things; like the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, that kind of thing."
237,tt0089280,3096,20,"But no, ""Hobgoblins"" it is and it is bad bad like your grandparents' wallpaper, bad as pink flamingos on your lawn, bad like underwear that says ""Home of the Whopper""...and I think we'll stop there."
238,tt0089280,3096,21,"Well, Mike and the robots fight valiantly but try as they might, they can do only so much with ""Hobgoblins"" before they realize that, yes, the director DOES need kicked in the shin."
239,tt0089280,3096,22,"Real, real hard."
240,tt0089280,3096,23,"One star for ""Hobgoblins"", seven stars for the MST3K version."
241,tt0089280,3097,1,"There can be no questions of spoilers for this movie, the director beat us all too and spoiled this movie in oh so many ways."
242,tt0089280,3097,2,"A blatant rip off of stuff like Critters and Gremlins, this movie fails on so many levels to recapture the humour and horror of those better made films."
243,tt0089280,3097,3,"It ends up a sleazy waste of time, where bad actors deliver bad dialogue in front of an idiot director, who occasionally tosses stuffed toys at them."
244,tt0089280,3097,4,"They wrestle with said toys in much the same manner as old Tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles, shaking them whilst screaming and trying their best to make it look slightly threatening."
245,tt0089280,3097,5,"It's painful to watch, and not helped by the mental 80's fashions worn by the cast."
246,tt0089280,3097,6,"Basically, some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by an aging security guard in a film lot finally get free after umpteen years confinement, and begin to telepathically screw around with peoples minds."
247,tt0089280,3097,7,"The guards new recruit, the idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings, gets his gang of 80's friends together and they go off and have minor adventures together while trying to recapture the Grem..."
248,tt0089280,3097,8,Hobgoblins.
249,tt0089280,3097,9,"All life is here, with the gang consisting of a knucklehead jock, his 80's slut girlfriend, the 'hero's frigid and prissy girlfriend, and the young hero, lacking in confidence and wishing his girlfriend would put out anyway."
250,tt0089280,3097,10,"First off comes the infamous rake fighting scene, where the ex military jock shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully, poking the nerdy hero with the wrong end of a rake for what seems like hours."
251,tt0089280,3097,11,"Then there's some running around, terminating in a real pie fight style ending in a scuzzy nightclub with comedy hand grenades blowing up everything except the people standing right next to them."
252,tt0089280,3097,12,"Then the film sorta ends, and alls well that ends well."
253,tt0089280,3097,13,It's not.
254,tt0089280,3097,14,"This is like watching a train wreck, you cant take your eyes off it, it's so bad."
255,tt0089280,3097,15,"Perfect fare for Mystery Science Theater, but god awful should you try to watch it alone and uncut."
256,tt0089280,3097,16,"The Fashion Police still have a number of outstanding warrants for the cast, and I dare anyone not to laugh in outright derision at the rake fight."
257,tt0089280,3097,17,"This scores 2 out of 10 at most, on a good day."
258,tt0089280,3098,1,How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion.
259,tt0089280,3098,2,This film is absolutely criminal.
260,tt0089280,3098,3,"Before watching this movie I thought Manos: Hands of Fate was the worse piece of crap I ever saw, but at least Manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep, thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer."
261,tt0089280,3098,4,"The greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the Hobgoblins ""locked"" up makes it to the final scene."
262,tt0089280,3098,5,The time I spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life.
263,tt0089280,3099,1,"This movie is not just bad, not just corny, it is repulsive."
264,tt0089280,3099,2,"Something about Daphne, about the creepy call girl, about the whole damn and I use the word literally film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress."
265,tt0089280,3099,3,"This film makes my skin crawl, makes me regret having reproductive organs, and makes me feel unclean."
266,tt0089280,3099,4,One of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept.
267,tt0089280,3099,5,"A creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results, rather than the clich√© Worst Nightmare and the overdone Twisted Wish, is a truly fascinating film idea."
268,tt0089280,3099,6,Thought: The reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights.
269,tt0089280,3099,7,"During the day, bright lights don't show up well, so they could go anywhere."
270,tt0089280,3099,8,"Count the Hobgoblins: Four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio, and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush toys are killed throughout the course of the movie."
271,tt0089280,3099,9,"Discussion Question: If you had a frigid, demanding, unappreciative girlfriend, would you enter garden tool combat with a military chunkhead."
272,tt0089280,3099,10,Explain.
273,tt0089280,3100,1,Hobgoblins....
274,tt0089280,3100,2,Hobgoblins....where do I begin.!.
275,tt0089280,3100,3,This film gives Manos The Hands of Fate and Future War a run for their money as the worst film ever made.
276,tt0089280,3100,4,"This one is fun to laugh at, where as Manos was just painful to watch."
277,tt0089280,3100,5,"Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term: ""80's cheeze""."
278,tt0089280,3100,6,"The acting and I am using this term loosely is atrocious, the Hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see, and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed."
279,tt0089280,3100,7,"The movie was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and that version is the only way to watch this mess."
280,tt0089280,3100,8,This movie gives Mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one liners they have ever done.
281,tt0089280,3100,9,If you try to watch this without the help of Mike and the bots.....
282,tt0089280,3100,10,God help you!!
283,tt0089280,3101,1,"This rip off of the 1984 hit ""Gremlins"" is quite possibly the biggest train wreck of a movie ever made."
284,tt0089280,3101,2,"Even for a 'B' grade movie, all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot, acting, and goodness."
285,tt0089280,3101,3,It begins with a random old security guard and the younger punky security guard whose name is of no importance.
286,tt0089280,3101,4,Why.
287,tt0089280,3101,5,"Because a few minutes into the film he walks into the 'forbidden' safe, and is killed whilst living out his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub."
288,tt0089280,3101,6,This is just an appetizer for the scat filled main course.
289,tt0089280,3101,7,"The main character, KEVIN, struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total pussy."
290,tt0089280,3101,8,"Perhaps he succeeds within the film, but to the audience he proves himself as nothing more than a bad actor."
291,tt0089280,3101,9,"Kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard, and is guided through his security shift in the wait for it abandoned studio lot."
292,tt0089280,3101,10,Yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself.
293,tt0089280,3101,11,Back to the film.
294,tt0089280,3101,12,Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the Hobgoblins.
295,tt0089280,3101,13,The Hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason.
296,tt0089280,3101,14,They must be returned before sunrise or else...or else what.
297,tt0089280,3101,15,Exactly.
298,tt0089280,3101,16,"Other characters include Kevin's 'macho' army friend NICK, Nick's 'woman' DAPHNE whose character has no more substance than a bitch slut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits."
299,tt0089280,3101,17,"There is Kevin's manipulative and 'reserved' girlfriend AMY, whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed Cher look alike with fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma underpants on top.."
300,tt0089280,3101,18,Don't ask me how that works.
301,tt0089280,3101,19,Quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is KYLE.
302,tt0089280,3101,20,How such groups of friends are made is up for question.
303,tt0089280,3101,21,Kyle is a perverted creep who can't go an hour without self stimulating.
304,tt0089280,3101,22,His hobbies include calling up sex chat lines from other people's houses and most likely sniffing underwear.
305,tt0089280,3101,23,"The story unfolds as the heroes search for the Hobgoblins: knee high creatures aka. hand puppets which, for some reason, attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighborhood."
306,tt0089280,3101,24,Each of the characters eventually lives out their wildest fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars... or the film having a big budget.
307,tt0089280,3101,25,"WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: The twist at the end of this movie will leave the watcher wondering ""What.""."
308,tt0089280,3101,26,The Hobgoblins are returned to the safe by...their own free will.
309,tt0089280,3101,27,"Perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to wreak havoc, or perhaps the story writers got writer's cramp and decided not to worry about the ending."
310,tt0089280,3101,28,"Upon returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals ""What he learned in the military"" and detonates explosives which destroys the safe, signaling the end of the evil Hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster ride; better fitted to a ride on an escalator."
311,tt0089280,3101,29,The sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears.
312,tt0089280,3101,30,"If you plan to watch it, I recommend a few alcoholic drinks beforehand to take any serious consideration of the film out of mind."
313,tt0089280,3102,1,"No matter how you look at this movie, it is just awful."
314,tt0089280,3102,2,"If you view it as a horror, then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets."
315,tt0089280,3102,3,"If you look at it as a comedy, then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame."
316,tt0089280,3102,4,If it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a Bch!
317,tt0089280,3102,5,If you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero.
318,tt0089280,3102,6,As you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining.
319,tt0089280,3102,7,As mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins type movie.
320,tt0089280,3102,8,This however has the worst looking monsters of that genre.
321,tt0089280,3102,9,"Critters looked pretty good, so did the Ghoulies, heck even the puppets from the Munchies looked better than these."
322,tt0089280,3102,10,The characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable.
323,tt0089280,3102,11,"The hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz."
324,tt0089280,3102,12,At one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes...this movie is just utterly stupid.
325,tt0089280,3102,13,"I like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum which is obviously not a club, but more likely a diner and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21."
326,tt0089280,3102,14,"Give me a break, I am 25 and I look younger than any of them."
327,tt0089280,3103,1,"So there's an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there's KEVIN, the world's biggest wuss."
328,tt0089280,3103,2,"Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, bratty, and virginal girlfriend AMY."
329,tt0089280,3103,3,"As he returns from work to... a random house... he finds his ""friends,"" the sexually confusing red shorted KYLE and the truly revolting sluttish DAPHNE."
330,tt0089280,3103,4,"They are soon joined by Daphne's boyfriend, the trigger happy sex crazed macho lunkhead NICK."
331,tt0089280,3103,5,"And there's the title creatures, horrid little dogeared puppets who kill people by giving them their heart's desire."
332,tt0089280,3103,6,"Kyle's heart's desire is to mate with a creepy, yucky woman in spandex."
333,tt0089280,3103,7,Nick's heart's desire is to throw grenades in a grade school cafeteria I mean nightclub.
334,tt0089280,3103,8,Kevin's heart's desire is to beat up a skinny thug with nunchucks.
335,tt0089280,3103,9,Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut.
336,tt0089280,3103,10,"Daphne's already a disgusting slut, so she doesn't have a heart's desire."
337,tt0089280,3103,11,Along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song.
338,tt0089280,3103,12,The hobgoblins randomly go back to where they came from then blow up.
339,tt0089280,3103,13,"""Citizen Kane"" cannot hold a candle to this true masterpiece of American cinema."
340,tt0317676,9169,1,It gets really bad.
341,tt0317676,9169,2,The only half way redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film.
342,tt0317676,9169,3,There are context errors everywhere.
343,tt0317676,9169,4,"The acting is horrible, save Kirk."
344,tt0317676,9169,5,"The story is as holey as the grail, and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie, if it wasn't already a corpse."
345,tt0317676,9169,6,So all in all it's a waste of your life.
346,tt0317676,9169,7,I would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale.
347,tt0317676,9170,1,"The question, when one sees a movie this bad, is not necessarily, ""How did a movie this bad get made."" or even, ""Why did I see this awful in the first place."" but, ""What have I learned from this experience."""
348,tt0317676,9170,2,"Here's what I learned: Just because the ""rules"" of horror movies have been catalogued and satirized countless times in the last ten years doesn't mean someone won't go ahead and make a movie that uses ALL of them, without a shred of humor or irony."
349,tt0317676,9170,3,"If your movie has to be described as loosely based on the video game, you have script problems."
350,tt0317676,9170,4,"The black character may not always die first, but the Asian character does always know kung fu."
351,tt0317676,9170,5,"While you may be proud that you figured out how to do the ""the Matrix effect"" on a budget, that doesn't necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea."
352,tt0317676,9170,6,Being Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee choice roles.
353,tt0317676,9170,7,"Whenever a scene doesn't edit together, just use some footage from the video game, no one will notice."
354,tt0317676,9170,8,"If your cousin's rap metal band offers to write your movie's theme for free, politely decline."
355,tt0317676,9170,9,Zombie movies are not about people killing zombies.
356,tt0317676,9170,10,"They're about zombies killing people, preferably in the most gruesome way possible."
357,tt0317676,9170,11,That's what makes them SCARY.
358,tt0317676,9170,12,White people who can pay $1600 to get to a rave deserve to die.
359,tt0317676,9170,13,"If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know."
360,tt0317676,9170,14,"Anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks, ""What was that."" or, ""Where are we."""
361,tt0317676,9170,15,Bare breasts are not horror movie panacea.
362,tt0317676,9170,16,"A helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with Sega magically transforms your movie from ""student film"" to ""major studio release""."
363,tt0317676,9170,17,Try it!

368,tt0317676,9170,22,"I've seen worse movies, but only because I've seen ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation."""
369,tt0317676,9171,1,What can I say.
370,tt0317676,9171,2,I ignored the reviews and went to see it myself.
371,tt0317676,9171,3,Damn the reviews were so right.
372,tt0317676,9171,4,What a waste of money considering it's budget.
373,tt0317676,9171,5,"Good thing, I went to see Kill Bill after this one."
374,tt0317676,9171,6,"To see a really scary movie, would be Crossroads!"
375,tt0317676,9171,7,"Bottom line I like ""Girl in Gold Boots"" better than this crap."
376,tt0317676,9172,1,"When I go to see a movie about zombie's, I'm not expecting oscar calibre performances, or writing on the level of The Godfather, but I do expect the actors to at least not look like their straining to read their cue cards, and dialogue that doesn't sound like it was typed out 10 minutes before the actor reads it into the camera."
377,tt0317676,9172,2,"This movie was just awful, I actually got up and left about 25 minutes in and went next door and watched Cold Creek Manor, that wasn't very good either, but it seemed like Citizen Kane compared to this pile of crap."
378,tt0317676,9172,3,"On the plus side, the girls were very pretty, that's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes, in fact I left after the hottest one got killed, there wasn't anything to hold my interest after that."
379,tt0317676,9173,1,I have never seen a worse movie.
380,tt0317676,9173,2,It is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie.
381,tt0317676,9173,3,Mistake 1: absolutely no connection to any of the characters.
382,tt0317676,9173,4,In this movie you don't bond with any of the characters because... you don't get a chance.
383,tt0317676,9173,5,The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard.
384,tt0317676,9173,6,"Except for this unique character, the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining."
385,tt0317676,9173,7,Mistake 2: the worst gunfight scene ever.
386,tt0317676,9173,8,I love gunfights.
387,tt0317676,9173,9,I love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house. heck I even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes.
388,tt0317676,9173,10,"But this gunfight was weird I guess that the best way to describe it is ""Apathetic"" I've seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while PLAYING THE VIDEOGAME."
389,tt0317676,9173,11,"In this movie it looked and felt like the ""Actors"" were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion."
390,tt0317676,9173,12,Why.
391,tt0317676,9173,13,Where's the trash talking. where's the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire.
392,tt0317676,9173,14,These are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad... but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity.
393,tt0317676,9173,15,"If you want a GOOD horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters, I recomend Sam Rami's Evil Dead series."
394,tt0317676,9173,16,DO NOT see the disaster that is house of the dead.
395,tt0317676,9173,17,I hope that they burn the master and all copies of this movie.
396,tt0317676,9174,1,"I usually like zombie movies, but this one was just plain bad."
397,tt0317676,9174,2,"The good parts: Girl swimming topless with thong bottoms, Sonya Salomaa's topless, and Ona Grauer's boobs jiggling in a skimpy top when she ran."
398,tt0317676,9174,3,"The bad part: too much video cuts, too much Matrix slow motion it drags the action, not enough blood and guts, bad acting, and no story."
399,tt0317676,9174,4,The only other person in the theater was smart and left right after the topless swimming scene.
400,tt0317676,9174,5,A total waste of $6 and time.
401,tt0317676,9174,6,I give it a 2 out of 10.
402,tt0317676,9175,1,This is about the worst movie I have ever seen.
403,tt0317676,9175,2,"This movie does match the quality of such movies as ""THEY"" & ""Cabin Fever"", but even those had name actors where this one fell short."
404,tt0317676,9175,3,"The ""eye candy"" of this movie looked to be a 50 woman with a bad face lift. just an example of the quality."
405,tt0317676,9175,4,I would have rated this movie in the negative if possible.
406,tt0317676,9175,5,"Ladies I have to tell you that the men were not bad to look at, but not much either."
407,tt0317676,9175,6,If you were planning on going to see this movie I would strongly recommend saving your money.
408,tt0317676,9176,1,You know you're in trouble when the opening narration basically tells you who survives.
409,tt0317676,9176,2,It all goes downhill from there.
410,tt0317676,9176,3,"Unnecessary, ""Matrix"" influenced bullet time camera work."
411,tt0317676,9176,4,Pointless cuts to video game footage.
412,tt0317676,9176,5,Crusty old sea captains and wacky seamen.
413,tt0317676,9176,6,Ravers who become skilled combatants in the blink of an eye.
414,tt0317676,9176,7,Even the zombies are boring.
415,tt0317676,9176,8,"I was hoping for at least a ""so bad it's good"" zombie movie, but this one is ""so bad those involved with its creation should be barred from ever making a movie again""."
416,tt0317676,9177,1,"The House of the Dead was the worst movie I have ever seen, between the pathetic 'matrix' 360 camera angle attemps and the cheesy acting I fell asleep."
417,tt0317676,9177,2,"I don't think that the director and set manager could decide whether it was raining or not, because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other."
418,tt0317676,9177,3,"I would rate this movie a 1 out of 10, 10 being the best, 1 being the worst."
419,tt0317676,9177,4,"Also jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lose time."
420,tt0317676,9177,5,"I beg anyone who reads this, NOT TO SEE IT."
421,tt0317676,9177,6,It's not worth the time.
422,tt0317676,9178,1,"The thing about calling ""House of the Dead"" the worst movie of all time is that it's really not."
423,tt0317676,9178,2,There are worse movies out there.
424,tt0317676,9178,3,"I watch alot of Hong Kong ninja movies that are basically the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama having footage of ninjas inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called ""a movie."""
425,tt0317676,9178,4,House of the Dead is however one of the worst films I've ever seen at the theatres.
426,tt0317676,9178,5,"Walking out half way through, I actually felt I was somewhat dumber for having set through 45 minutes of this piece of garbage."
427,tt0317676,9179,1,It is cheese.
428,tt0317676,9179,2,"If all you want is a video game, complete with what look like straight from the computer cutaway sequences for action the film was too cheap to actually make special effects for, this is it."
429,tt0317676,9179,3,"My friend and I actually had a great time seeing it, since the theatre was mostly empty and we could heckle a bit."
430,tt0317676,9179,4,This movie REALLY requires heckling.
431,tt0317676,9179,5,Plot.
432,tt0317676,9179,6,There was a plot.
433,tt0317676,9179,7,"OK, some stupid college or later types get invited to ""the rave of the year"" and go to one of the San Juan Islands ""If they'd only stayed back in Seattle, they would have survived."" direct quote, or nearly. to attend."
434,tt0317676,9179,8,"They get there and everyone is gone, and the site is somewhat wrecked but hey, the keg is still full!."
435,tt0317676,9179,9,"With the help of a crusty old captain and a coast guard woman who acted only slightly less tough and slightly less well than Cynthia Rothrock, they fight lots of zombies some which spit acid, get an earful of freaky legends, and mostly get killed."
436,tt0317676,9179,10,That's about it.
437,tt0317676,9179,11,"It's not quite as BAD as Demonicus, but not by much, and still better than Severed they are sort of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies the former is bad but fun to heckle, and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once."
438,tt0317676,9179,12,"On the other hand, if you're expecting a video game movie as excellent as Resident Evil, run away!!!"
439,tt0317676,9179,13,run away now!!!
440,tt0317676,9179,14,"OK, some real big questions without too many spoilers: Since when did Spanish ships of the 18th century venture into the Pacific Northwest....."
441,tt0317676,9179,15,"Why is anyone in the Pacific Northwest smuggling guns, and to whom CANADA, for crying out loud..."
442,tt0317676,9179,16,"Why is a rave on an unnamed oh, excuse me, it's called ""isla del muerto"", shya, right San Juan Island and outdoors, still keeping in mind this is THE PACIFIC NORTHWET."
443,tt0317676,9179,17,"And the rave has about 30 people in attendance ""the rave of the year,"" my patoot."
444,tt0317676,9179,18,Lucky thing there's lots of hatchets around.
445,tt0317676,9179,19,Lots of them.
446,tt0317676,9179,20,Everyone has them.
447,tt0317676,9179,21,Must be a hatchet sales outlet nearby.
448,tt0317676,9179,22,"Finally, while the movie started out playing with a little ""parody"" with nudges at I Know What You Did and Jaws, it didn't carry it through near enough."
449,tt0317676,9179,23,"OK, really finally when the introductory comments in a voice over, no less casually mention that one of the characters ""gave up her boyfriend to focus on her fencing"" you can be darn sure there'll be some fencing by the end of the movie."
450,tt0317676,9179,24,"Not GOOD fencing, but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords, anyway."
451,tt0317676,9180,1,"Okay, let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone who's read the other comments."
452,tt0317676,9180,2,"That being said, MY G D, THIS MOVIE REEKED!"
453,tt0317676,9180,3,"I mean, WOW, I didn't know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and still come out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie!"
454,tt0317676,9180,4,Corman was probably pitched this movie at some point but declined due to the poor quality of the script!
455,tt0317676,9180,5,"The only reason this movie got made in the first place is that someone said, 'Hey, Zombies are popular."
456,tt0317676,9180,6,Video games are popular.
457,tt0317676,9180,7,What game can we get a hold of that has zombies in it.
458,tt0317676,9180,8,Resident Evil.
459,tt0317676,9180,9,"No, someone else got there first."
460,tt0317676,9180,10,Silent Hill.
461,tt0317676,9180,11,"No, too silent."
462,tt0317676,9180,12,People will never sit in a dark room just to be scared silly.
463,tt0317676,9180,13,"Hey, didn't Sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies."
464,tt0317676,9180,14,"They're out of the platform biz, we could get that for pennies!'"
465,tt0317676,9180,15,"Basically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game, even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game."
466,tt0317676,9180,16,The first and major problem is that the original game was horrid.
467,tt0317676,9180,17,"I mean,bad movie merchandising made into a worse game in two weeks and then shippe d out and bought by morons and their parents for christmas horrid."
468,tt0317676,9180,18,The graphics were boring.
469,tt0317676,9180,19,The monsters were boring.
470,tt0317676,9180,20,The levels were boring.
471,tt0317676,9180,21,The interface was boring.
472,tt0317676,9180,22,The CASE was boring.
473,tt0317676,9180,23,"In other words, this was a boring game."
474,tt0317676,9180,24,And that was the ARCADE version.
475,tt0317676,9180,25,The home version was even worse!
476,tt0317676,9180,26,"With the home version, you didn't even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game!"
477,tt0317676,9180,27,But I digress.
478,tt0317676,9180,28,The second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes.
479,tt0317676,9180,29,HUH...
480,tt0317676,9180,30,Didn't the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on.
481,tt0317676,9180,31,"Not to mention that EVERY fight was shot from the perspective of a video game, which may explain the tedious use of Matrix style effects."
482,tt0317676,9180,32,The problem with this is that the game was a first person shooter the player proceeds from the POV of the character.
483,tt0317676,9180,33,"Maybe that's why they put in the game graphics, to let you know that they were alluding to the game..."
484,tt0317676,9180,34,"Right, whatever..."
485,tt0317676,9180,35,"Anyway, the only thing that made this ENTIRE experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud, so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken as commonplace and didn't get me kicked out."
486,tt0317676,9180,36,"To sum up, DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE!"
487,tt0317676,9180,37,Don't even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week.
488,tt0317676,9180,38,Run.
489,tt0317676,9180,39,Just run.
490,tt0317676,9181,1,"I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my GOD!!!"
491,tt0317676,9181,2,This was THE worst movie I have ever seen.
492,tt0317676,9181,3,"Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad everything!"
493,tt0317676,9181,4,The plot follows a group of teen cliche's on their way to a rave that takes place in broad daylight at a remote island.
494,tt0317676,9181,5,"However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes."
495,tt0317676,9181,6,"Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party goers, the clan set's off on a mission through a zombie infested forest."
496,tt0317676,9181,7,"During this crusade, they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids."
497,tt0317676,9181,8,They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors.
498,tt0317676,9181,9,"Basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the ""house of the dead."""
499,tt0317676,9181,10,"This fight came complete with cheesy Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game, and sloppy matrix esque camera rotations."
500,tt0317676,9181,11,One of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others.
501,tt0317676,9181,12,Why.
502,tt0317676,9181,13,"Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled!"
503,tt0317676,9181,14,I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy.!.
504,tt0317676,9181,15,"To sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is."
505,tt0317676,9181,16,"The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sht could easily cover the costs it took to make it."
506,tt0317676,9181,17,GRADE: F
507,tt0317676,9182,1,"Just like everybody else have said, the acting is awful, no story or whatsoever, poor directing."
508,tt0317676,9182,2,"About the SFX, the 360 degree, matrix style shooting, 1 shoot is stupid enough, but for each characters."
509,tt0317676,9182,3,I mean come on gimme a break.
510,tt0317676,9182,4,"And what's up with all those video game scenes, just to remind us it's a ""video game adaptation""."
511,tt0317676,9182,5,"Jesus, they should have fired whoever think up this idea.0.00001/10"
512,tt0317676,9183,1,"If there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10, this would be it."
513,tt0317676,9183,2,"'House of the Dead' redefines the term ""bad movie""."
514,tt0317676,9183,3,"Other bad movies, such as 'When A Stranger Calls' or 'Premonition', will actually look much better when compared to 'House of the Dead'."
515,tt0317676,9183,4,"The basic ""plot"" of House of the Dead is a group of twenty somethings travel to a remote island to attend the ""rave of the century""."
516,tt0317676,9183,5,"When they get there, they only find some tents, a bar, a stage, and some bloody t shirts."
517,tt0317676,9183,6,"They decide to stay anyway, and they are soon attacked by zombies."
518,tt0317676,9183,7,There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie.
519,tt0317676,9183,8,It is not entertaining.
520,tt0317676,9183,9,"Instead, it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is."
521,tt0317676,9183,10,The acting is unbelievably bad.
522,tt0317676,9183,11,"In a DVD interview, one of the actors claimed that Uwe Boll, the director, is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene."
523,tt0317676,9183,12,This is a blatant lie.
524,tt0317676,9183,13,"The script appears to have been written by an 11 year old, who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line, ""it smells like someone farted out here."""
525,tt0317676,9183,14,The characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie.
526,tt0317676,9183,15,"Somewhere along the way, the characters also magically transform into a SWAT team to take down the zombies."
527,tt0317676,9183,16,It's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head.
528,tt0317676,9183,17,The scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing.
529,tt0317676,9183,18,There is something wrong with Uwe Boll.
530,tt0317676,9183,19,Boll's camera work is astonishingly disjointed.
531,tt0317676,9183,20,His pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing.
532,tt0317676,9183,21,"Worse yet, Boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the House of the Dead video game into the movie."
533,tt0317676,9183,22,"Quite often, and at the most random times, you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot."
534,tt0317676,9183,23,It makes no sense.
535,tt0317676,9183,24,No one in their right mind would think that was a good idea.
536,tt0317676,9183,25,It's like Boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game.
537,tt0317676,9183,26,"Uwe Boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes, a la 'The Matrix'."
538,tt0317676,9183,27,"Unfortunately, he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating."
539,tt0317676,9183,28,The soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind.
540,tt0317676,9183,29,Most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track.
541,tt0317676,9183,30,This also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious 'House of the Dead'.'
542,tt0317676,9183,31,House of the Dead' isn't bad because it's based on a video game.
543,tt0317676,9183,32,"In fact, it has very little to do with the video game."
544,tt0317676,9183,33,It also does not fit into the category of 'so bad that it's good'.
545,tt0317676,9183,34,It does however fit into the category of 'so bad that it's painful'.
546,tt0317676,9183,35,This movie just plain sucks.
547,tt0317676,9183,36,Uwe Boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set.
548,tt0317676,9183,37,Even his presence will curse a production.
549,tt0317676,9183,38,"To all the directors out there: whenever one of your movies gets a bad review, all you have to do is remember that you didn't make 'House of the Dead' and you will feel much better."
550,tt0317676,9183,39,I will never get those 90 minutes of my life back.
551,tt0317676,9183,40,"To sum it up, words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is."
552,tt0317676,9183,41,"Everyone involved in the production of this film, especially Uwe Boll, should be ashamed of themselves."
553,tt0317676,9183,42,"Although what I have said may make 'House of the Dead' sound funny, it really isn't."
554,tt0317676,9183,43,Nothing about it is funny.
555,tt0317676,9183,44,Avoid this at all costs.
556,tt0317676,9184,1,Fck Me!
557,tt0317676,9184,2,I've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the pss!
558,tt0317676,9184,3,Honestly I can't express in words how bad this film actually is.
559,tt0317676,9184,4,"Besides the plot that isn't really there, the comically crap acting, the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies; You know what, I could go on all day."
560,tt0317676,9184,5,"Every little thing in this film is either stupid, pointless, crap or embarrassing."
561,tt0317676,9184,6,I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie... don't!
562,tt0317676,9184,7,"I'm ashamed to say, I have this on my rack."
563,tt0317676,9184,8,It's hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile.
564,tt0317676,9184,9,I couldn't even give this horse sht excuse for a film away.
565,tt0317676,9184,10,That's how bad it is.
566,tt0317676,9185,1,WOW!
567,tt0317676,9185,2,i didn't know that someone would make this movie!
568,tt0317676,9185,3,its awful!
569,tt0317676,9185,4,"I have written down 5 things that can tell why u do not want to see this movie.number 1: ""its the biggest rave ever"" where is the that rave. i could only see a few people dancing around.."
570,tt0317676,9185,5,"2. when they are on the rave,they can ONLY see blood everywhere,no people,two ruined tents and one stage.. and what do they do!. they drink!"
571,tt0317676,9185,6,3.the worst actors i have ever seen!
572,tt0317676,9185,7,the captain and his crew.. awful!
573,tt0317676,9185,8,"4. when one of the people is firing an ordinary gun, he shoots almost 30 times without reloading!"
574,tt0317676,9185,9,5. i didn't knew every person in the world could fight as a pro!
575,tt0317676,9185,10,must be a new thing..i wonder what the producer was thinking!
576,tt0317676,9185,11,"""this is going to be a big hit, its gonna be a classic"" .. sure u dumb st anyway don't see this movie, its a waist of time."
577,tt0317676,9185,12,MY EYES ARE STILL BLEEDING!
578,tt0317676,9186,1,"You know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that's trying so hard to be a serious, thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably."
579,tt0317676,9186,2,When you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen.
580,tt0317676,9186,3,"""House of the Dead"" struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema."
581,tt0317676,9186,4,"From start to end ""House of the Dead"" manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept."
582,tt0317676,9186,5,"It is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size which they exploit shamelessly whereas the males for their hardcore ""kick ass"" attitude."
583,tt0317676,9186,6,I honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture.
584,tt0317676,9186,7,Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie.
585,tt0317676,9186,8,At least then we'll get better acting¬Ö However not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film.
586,tt0317676,9186,9,"It is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as: ""These are zombies, pure and simple"" and ""No cap'n, we must not go there!"
587,tt0317676,9186,10,"It's evil!""."
588,tt0317676,9186,11,"We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning; at best they are a harmless two hours of action, blood and closet terror."
589,tt0317676,9186,12,"Trash, yes, but entertaining trash."
590,tt0317676,9186,13,Not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins.
591,tt0317676,9186,14,"According to IMDb, ""House of the Dead"" received such bad reviews that no Danish cinemas bought the movie."
592,tt0317676,9186,15,If only we could have had the same privilege.
593,tt0317676,9186,16,Final Score: 1/10.
594,tt0317676,9187,1,"I have watched some pretty poor films in the past, but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie."
595,tt0317676,9187,2,"Had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it, because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it."
596,tt0317676,9187,3,"I am a fan of most genres and enjoy ""shoot 'em up"" games, but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable."
597,tt0317676,9187,4,"As most have already said, there was hardly any script and the acting was weak."
598,tt0317676,9187,5,I won't waste my time describing it.
599,tt0317676,9187,6,"Anyone who rates this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or Sega, or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment."
600,tt0317676,9187,7,"I must say, I was more annoyed with the video shop, who gave this a thumbs up, which led me to rent it."
601,tt0317676,9187,8,Thank god I had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies.
602,tt0317676,9187,9,"Comic book guy would be right if he said ""Worst movie ever""!"
603,tt0317676,9188,1,"This is the only film I've seen that is made by Uwe Boll, I knew that he is probably the worst director ever who always makes films based on video games also that ""House of the Dead"" is one of IMDb bottom 100."
604,tt0317676,9188,2,But I still wanted to watch it because I'm a huge fan of the game and I wanted to see what doe's the film have that makes it so bad.
605,tt0317676,9188,3,"After watching it I do agree that it is crap, the movie had no story."
606,tt0317676,9188,4,In the first 15 20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about for a moment there I was wondering are the zombies brain dead. or the girls are. then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere & started attacking people later a woman started shooting them I mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes.
607,tt0317676,9188,5,"Is it supposed to be a comedy., or horror. or both."
608,tt0317676,9188,6,"Before I knew it I fell asleep at the second half & woke up during the end credits so I did not manage to watch all of it, which is a good thing!"
609,tt0317676,9188,7,"The film is a true insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll please do not make any more films."
610,tt0317676,9188,8,Thank you!
611,tt0317676,9189,1,This movie has received a lot of bad press from people who don't understand what it was meant to be.
612,tt0317676,9189,2,One must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously.
613,tt0317676,9189,3,"It's camp, along the same lines as ""Army of Darkness."""
614,tt0317676,9189,4,"AoD was silly, but funny and bad in a good way."
615,tt0317676,9189,5,"""House of the Dead"" fails to be ""good bad.""."
616,tt0317676,9189,6,"There are qualities inherent in good campy movies, most important of those being believable fantasy."
617,tt0317676,9189,7,One needs to believe what's happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong.
618,tt0317676,9189,8,"Without boundaries, the movie becomes absurd."
619,tt0317676,9189,9,HotD lacks any believability.
620,tt0317676,9189,10,"Worse still, HotD brings nothing new to the genre, and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit."
621,tt0317676,9189,11,"For example, all too often, horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction."
622,tt0317676,9189,12,"I don't know about you, but when I'm being chased by zombies, I wanna make out with a hot chick."
623,tt0317676,9189,13,Believe it.
624,tt0317676,9189,14,No.
625,tt0317676,9189,15,"Then, you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking each other's faces in this movie."
626,tt0317676,9189,16,"Beyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies, Uwe Boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot, randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie."
627,tt0317676,9189,17,"Not only is there no clear rationale for this artistic choice, but it distracts one from an already unbelievable plot."
628,tt0317676,9189,18,"Further, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting, and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors' reactions to events... leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities."
629,tt0317676,9189,19,Avoid...
630,tt0317676,9190,1,This is by far THE WORST movie i have ever watched.
631,tt0317676,9190,2,"I've seen some pretty awful movies in my time but this ones takes the cake, no, wait, i mean the the whole damn bakery."
632,tt0317676,9190,3,It is so bad that i believe a word to describe the way you will feel after watching this atrocity has yet to be created.
633,tt0317676,9190,4,"Please just do yourself a favor, if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur Barney, then multiply that thirty times fold and you would still only get a small fraction of the horror you would be in store for."
634,tt0317676,9190,5,"In summation, i guess you really can call it a horror movie, but only if you're willing to be scared senseless by the worst acting in the business and utterly pointless story."
635,tt0317676,9190,6,"Real Rating, 10 Disgusting"
636,tt0317676,9191,1,"Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle of ooze."
637,tt0317676,9191,2,Why.
638,tt0317676,9191,3,Because I have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is.
639,tt0317676,9191,4,It's unbelievably bad.
640,tt0317676,9191,5,"Just to let you in on how bad it is, I'll offer this little detail about the movie."
641,tt0317676,9191,6,"During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game."
642,tt0317676,9191,7,"Yes, you heard me right."
643,tt0317676,9191,8,This movie really sucks.
644,tt0317676,9191,9,"In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days."
645,tt0317676,9191,10,And to see corn filled crap like this.
646,tt0317676,9191,11,There is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills.
647,tt0317676,9191,12,"I'm really disappointed with this, knowing that I watched it."
648,tt0317676,9191,13,"OK, I'm dumbstruck."
649,tt0317676,9191,14,It's so bad I can't even find the words.
650,tt0317676,9191,15,RATING: ZERO out of .
651,tt0317676,9192,1,I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store.
652,tt0317676,9192,2,That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there.
653,tt0317676,9192,3,From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.'
654,tt0317676,9192,4,"However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is."
655,tt0317676,9192,5,It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory.
656,tt0317676,9192,6,There is no horror here folks.
657,tt0317676,9192,7,"Just some half way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie."
658,tt0317676,9192,8,It's a pity.
659,tt0317676,9192,9,I think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud.
660,tt0317676,9192,10,"Though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character."
661,tt0317676,9192,11,Also what is ROYALLY annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game.
662,tt0317676,9192,12,I've played the game.
663,tt0317676,9192,13,It sucks.
664,tt0317676,9192,14,So why did they put it in here.
665,tt0317676,9192,15,"Oh that's right, this isn't a movie but a music video, and it's a poor one at that."
666,tt0317676,9192,16,"3/10Rated R: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity"
667,tt0317676,9193,1,"Okay, so I'm not a big video game buff, but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from."
668,tt0317676,9193,2,"Sure, they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie, as though justifying any particular scene of violence, but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same, with the hand in the bottom on the screen, supposedly your own, holding whatever weapon and goo ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be."
669,tt0317676,9193,3,"It's an interesting premise in House of the Dead, with a lot of college kids LOADED college kids, as it were, kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like $1,500 just for a ride after they miss their boat trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year."
670,tt0317676,9193,4,The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations.
671,tt0317676,9193,5,"At least in this case, the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed."
672,tt0317676,9193,6,"They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter tops, but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion."
673,tt0317676,9193,7,"Clint Howard, tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far, delivers an absolutely awful performance, the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie."
674,tt0317676,9193,8,"I can't stand it when well known actors change their accents in movies, it is so rarely effective, and Howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well known actor pretend that he's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air."
675,tt0317676,9193,9,He didn't even rasp well.
676,tt0317676,9193,10,It sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something.
677,tt0317676,9193,11,"Real tough there, Clint!"
678,tt0317676,9193,12,"I expected more from him, but then again, he did agree to a part in this mess."
679,tt0317676,9193,13,"Once we get to the island, the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the 13th movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake."
680,tt0317676,9193,14,Lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed.
681,tt0317676,9193,15,"The nudity was impressive, I guess, but let's consider something for a minute."
682,tt0317676,9193,16,"These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year, find NO ONE, and say, well, who wants a beer!"
683,tt0317676,9193,17,Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight.
684,tt0317676,9193,18,Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll There's alcohol!
685,tt0317676,9193,19,They won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves!
686,tt0317676,9193,20,"So not only do they start drinking, not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island, but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along, the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone."
687,tt0317676,9193,21,"It's like they expected to find the island empty, and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while, they would have some privacy since there's no one else around."
688,tt0317676,9193,22,Brilliant!
689,tt0317676,9193,23,"Now for the things that everyone hated, judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie."
690,tt0317676,9193,24,"Yes, intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie, mostly in order to show that, yes, the movie was being faithful to/directly copying the video game."
691,tt0317676,9193,25,"Sure, it was a stupid idea."
692,tt0317676,9193,26,"I can't imagine who thought up that little nugget, but worse than that is the Matrix style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over."
693,tt0317676,9193,27,After the first time at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film.
694,tt0317676,9193,28,"One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans, who are much faster but getting tired, running out of places to run, and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with."
695,tt0317676,9193,29,"The first two are done right in the movie, the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island, but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler, they find themselves heavily armed."
696,tt0317676,9193,30,And I mean that very strongly.
697,tt0317676,9193,31,"I mean, these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades, which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead."
698,tt0317676,9193,32,Then you have what I call the techno slasher scene.
699,tt0317676,9193,33,"Since the rave never happened, and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie, there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead, and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video."
700,tt0317676,9193,34,"There's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot, mostly only about 5 frames long which is about 1/6 of a second flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music."
701,tt0317676,9193,35,"Clever, I guess, but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it."
702,tt0317676,9193,36,You're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie.
703,tt0317676,9193,37,"I've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil, mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it, and they're exactly right."
704,tt0317676,9193,38,"I appreciate that at least here, as was not the case in Resident Evil, it wasn't some man made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people, changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires."
705,tt0317676,9193,39,"28 Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie, it's just too bad that House of the Dead didn't do a single original thing, except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based, just in case you forget."
706,tt0317676,9193,40,I really think that this should have been a much better movie.
707,tt0317676,9193,41,"While obviously I can't say that I know much about the game it's based on, just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie, but unfortunately I think that's more often the case than not with horror movies."
708,tt0317676,9193,42,"It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no holds barred horror film, and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel."
709,tt0317676,9194,1,"Ok, first of all, I am a huge zombie movie fan."
710,tt0317676,9194,2,I loved all of Romero's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re make of Dawn of the Dead.
711,tt0317676,9194,3,So when I had heard every single critic railing this movie I was still optimistic.
712,tt0317676,9194,4,"I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and while it may not be a particularly great film, I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot em up with a half decent plot."
713,tt0317676,9194,5,"This however, is pure crap."
714,tt0317676,9194,6,"Terrible dialogue, half assed plot, and video game scenes inserted into the film."
715,tt0317676,9194,7,Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea.
716,tt0317676,9194,8,The only thing about this movie I use the term loosely that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk Ugh.
717,tt0317676,9194,9,"While his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it."
718,tt0317676,9194,10,Everyone else acts as if they're doing Shakespeare.
719,tt0317676,9194,11,And very badly I might add.
720,tt0317676,9194,12,Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a.
721,tt0317676,9194,13,Are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b.
722,tt0317676,9194,14,"Like to play MST3K, the home game."
723,tt0317676,9194,15,See it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs.
724,tt0317676,9195,1,"Laid up and drugged out, as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract, with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi oblivion, I happened to catch this movie on cable."
725,tt0317676,9195,2,"I wouldn't want anyone to think that I paid to view it in a cinema, or rented it, or ¬ñ heaven forfend!"
726,tt0317676,9195,3,"¬ñ that I watched it STRAIGHT.Having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of The House, battling Chariot Type 27, The Hanged Man Type 041, and other impossible sentinels, my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen."
727,tt0317676,9195,4,It doesn't.
728,tt0317676,9195,5,"The banal plot revolves around a group of ""crazy kids"" ¬ñ a la Scooby Doo ¬ñ attending a remote island for a world shaking ""rave"" ¬ñ whatever that is."
729,tt0317676,9195,6,"You kids today with your hula hoops and your mini skirts and your Pat Boone¬Ö After bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric, they find the ""rave"" deserted."
730,tt0317676,9195,7,"Passing mention is made of a ""house"" ¬ñ presumably the titular House Of The Dead ¬ñ but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence."
731,tt0317676,9195,8,"A fallen video camera acts as flashback filler, showing the island in the throes of a ¬ñ party.!"
732,tt0317676,9195,9,Is that it.
733,tt0317676,9195,10,"Oh, so this ""rave"" thingy is just a ""party""."
734,tt0317676,9195,11,"In the grand tradition of re euphemizing ""used cars"" as ""pre owned"", or ""shell shock"" as ""post traumatic stress disorder"", the word ""party"" is now too square for you drug addled, silicone implanted, metrosexual jagoffs."
735,tt0317676,9195,12,It is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies.
736,tt0317676,9195,13,Intelligent thought stops here¬ÖI don't think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re animation.
737,tt0317676,9195,14,Zombies can't die ¬ñ they're already UN DEAD.
738,tt0317676,9195,15,"They do not bleed, they know no pain."
739,tt0317676,9195,16,"Unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue being animated."
740,tt0317676,9195,17,"At least, that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me."
741,tt0317676,9195,18,"Which means that a .45 shot into their ""hearts"" is not going to stop them, nor will a machete to the torso."
742,tt0317676,9195,19,And a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly NOT bring forth gouts of blood.
743,tt0317676,9195,20,"At least in the video game's logic, the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a fetid mush that cannot re animate itself."
744,tt0317676,9195,21,"Yet each actor slash model gets their Matrix circular camera moment, slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum."
745,tt0317676,9195,22,"Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers from ""Return Of The Jedi"", who get knocked out when Ewoks trip them."
746,tt0317676,9195,23,"I suppose the film's writer, Mark Altman, having penned the not too shabby ""Free Enterprise"", felt compelled to insert a Captain Kirk reference, in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung swill."
747,tt0317676,9195,24,"There is also a reference to Prochnow's primo role in the magnificent ""Das Boot"", when one of the untrained B actors mentions that he ""looks like a U Boat Captain""."
748,tt0317676,9195,25,"""."
749,tt0317676,9195,26,"I wonder how many of this movie's target audience of square eyed swine picked up on ANY of the snide references to other films, as when Prochnow declares, ""Say hello to my little friend"", presaging his machine gun moment."
750,tt0317676,9195,27,"Aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the Sisyphean futility of the video game concept i.e. the game ends when you die ¬ñ you cannot win, this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart."
751,tt0317676,9195,28,"Accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People."
752,tt0317676,9195,29,"A better use for this film's scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through Acting School, although Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job, as did her right breast ¬ñ and those slomo running scenes: priceless!"
753,tt0317676,9195,30,"I especially liked the final scene with Ona trying to act like she's been stabbed, but looking like she's just eaten ice cream too fast."
754,tt0317676,9195,31,"Attempting to do something more constructive with my time, I pulled out my Digitally Restored, 35th Anniversary, Special Edition, Widescreen Anamorphic DVD of ""Manos: The Hands Of Fate."""

756,tt0317676,9195,33,"¬ñ the drugs were suitably brain numbing now HERE was some quality film making¬ÖMovie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com"
757,tt0317676,9196,1,This is one of the worst films I've seen.
758,tt0317676,9196,2,The only positive thing I can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical.
759,tt0317676,9196,3,"First off, there's no plot."
760,tt0317676,9196,4,The actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things.
761,tt0317676,9196,5,Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends.
762,tt0317676,9196,6,"Also the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any of Romero's work, who gets s plug in the movie."
763,tt0317676,9196,7,And the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences.
764,tt0317676,9196,8,Like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies.
765,tt0317676,9196,9,"Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun."
766,tt0317676,9196,10,And the way the people die is so stupid.
767,tt0317676,9196,11,It's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on.
768,tt0317676,9196,12,"And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So dumb."
769,tt0317676,9196,13,"FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they've been blessed with a second chance."
770,tt0317676,9196,14,Definitely the worst film I've seen in years.
771,tt0317676,9196,15,A B movie on cinemax is better.
772,tt0317676,9197,1,There are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one.
773,tt0317676,9197,2,"Even if you were totally oblivious of Ed Wood's work, one look at that commentator from ""Plan 9 from outer space"" and you just KNOW you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece."
774,tt0317676,9197,3,"Just like that, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece ""House of Dead"", with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City, I knew I'm in for a helluva ride."
775,tt0317676,9197,4,"So, the movie starts like this first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die."
776,tt0317676,9197,5,"You know, to keep you wandering."
777,tt0317676,9197,6,"Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like ""Karma..thinks she's Foxy Brown"" or ""Alicia..my ex.. we broke up recently.."
778,tt0317676,9197,7,"I had to study and she had to fence""."
779,tt0317676,9197,8,"No, I'm not kidding."
780,tt0317676,9197,9,"Anyway, this bunch of 20 somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag are going to the ""Rave of the century"", rave in question being a few tents, a port a potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the Pacific."
781,tt0317676,9197,10,"Our gang missed the ferry, but thankfully will find a way to get there, the way being a fisher boat ran by Kirk Cpt Kirk."
782,tt0317676,9197,11,Get it.
783,tt0317676,9197,12,"Man, whoever wrote this script is a genius and his sidekick who is a bastard child of Simpsons' Cpt McAllister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer."
784,tt0317676,9197,13,"To make the long story short, the gang gets to the island, finds nobody there except some bloody T shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there."
785,tt0317676,9197,14,"No wait, they do not, they actually get all happy and like cos there's free booze."
786,tt0317676,9197,15,With that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill.
787,tt0317676,9197,16,"Some guys in rubber suits start running around, there is some screaming and shooting, our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang, they go out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons and then decide to go back to the house."
788,tt0317676,9197,17,"Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team, enter the Matrix, the rubber suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this."
789,tt0317676,9197,18,"To add insult to the injury, every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game over cut scene for a few characters when they die."
790,tt0317676,9197,19,I seriously hate this movie.
791,tt0317676,9197,20,"It doesn't even fit in that famed ""So bad it's good"" category."
792,tt0317676,9197,21,It's just plain bad.
793,tt0317676,9197,22,"The script is bad, the zombies are awful, there is no tension, lines are bad, actors are bad.. the list just goes on."
794,tt0317676,9197,23,You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful.
795,tt0317676,9197,24,Don't.
796,tt0317676,9197,25,There are bad movies that deserve to be watched.
797,tt0317676,9197,26,This is not one of them.
798,tt0317676,9198,1,There are people out there who will greenlight anything!
799,tt0317676,9198,2,That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists.
800,tt0317676,9198,3,And that's only scary part to the whole movie.
801,tt0317676,9198,4,It's so bad you'll go off movies forever.
802,tt0317676,9198,5,I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing.
803,tt0317676,9198,6,I don't know why I do these bad things to myself.
804,tt0317676,9198,7,"As if it matters, here's the basic jist of the 'story'."
805,tt0317676,9198,8,"A group of twenty somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest Canada actually, because it's cheap for the 'Rave of the Century' which consists of about 8 people and un raving music that they pay some craggy old fisherman $1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry."
806,tt0317676,9198,9,That's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough!
807,tt0317676,9198,10,The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead hang on I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead. and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.
808,tt0317676,9198,11,First faults here.
809,tt0317676,9198,12,Why would a tiny little rave of the Century my foot!
810,tt0317676,9198,13,be held on some remote island.
811,tt0317676,9198,14,Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it.
812,tt0317676,9198,15,Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others.
813,tt0317676,9198,16,"Once they arrive they discover that the rave which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port a john has been smashed, there's blood everywhere and no one is around."
814,tt0317676,9198,17,What would any rationally thinking person do.
815,tt0317676,9198,18,Run for their lives of course.
816,tt0317676,9198,19,"But no, these clueless, obviously blind people decide to go look for them."
817,tt0317676,9198,20,Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside.
818,tt0317676,9198,21,"Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows, as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters, and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again."
819,tt0317676,9198,22,"The characters, like the movie, go nowhere."
820,tt0317676,9198,23,"Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbo jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once popular arcade game of the same name."
821,tt0317676,9198,24,Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I'll never know.
822,tt0317676,9198,25,"The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further, if that is at all possible."
823,tt0317676,9198,26,"It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap, throwaway line at the end."
824,tt0317676,9198,27,It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory.
825,tt0317676,9198,28,"Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems multi Oscar worthy in comparison to this junk."
826,tt0317676,9198,29,The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow.
827,tt0317676,9198,30,He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character.
828,tt0317676,9198,31,The rest of the cast suck I'm afraid.
829,tt0317676,9198,32,The characters are idiots and deserve to die.
830,tt0317676,9198,33,"Plus, if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity, I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV."
831,tt0317676,9198,34,It's not frightening in the slightest.
832,tt0317676,9198,35,Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film.
833,tt0317676,9198,36,And where did all those bad guys come from anyway.
834,tt0317676,9198,37,There were only a few people on the island to begin with.
835,tt0317676,9198,38,I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over.
836,tt0317676,9198,39,"I kid you not, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times."
837,tt0317676,9198,40,Who's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid.
838,tt0317676,9198,41,None other than director Uwe Boll.
839,tt0317676,9198,42,His control over the movie is non existent.
840,tt0317676,9198,43,You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously.
841,tt0317676,9198,44,The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card.
842,tt0317676,9198,45,It all feels very unnatural.
843,tt0317676,9198,46,Plus the film is shot like a two part mini series.
844,tt0317676,9198,47,I have indeed seen better TV productions.
845,tt0317676,9198,48,And don't get me started on the editing.
846,tt0317676,9198,49,The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans.
847,tt0317676,9198,50,No real skill or talent was put into making this at all.
848,tt0317676,9198,51,It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A.
849,tt0317676,9198,52,Romero can't even get anyone to take his calls.
850,tt0317676,9198,53,House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'post modern' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.
851,tt0317676,9198,54,"For what it's worth, the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over used ADR even more."
852,tt0317676,9198,55,The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself.
853,tt0317676,9198,56,Isn't this review warning enough.
854,tt0317676,9198,57,Stay away!
855,tt0317676,9198,58,You are all doomed I tell you!
856,tt0317676,9198,59,Doomed!
857,tt0317676,9198,60,Doomed!!!
858,tt0450345,7537,1,"And I thought The Beach was bad, with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage."
859,tt0450345,7537,2,"Don't blame him for the awful script, if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie, give your self a pat on the back."
860,tt0450345,7537,3,Its a cross between The Village and a crappier script.
861,tt0450345,7537,4,"Its starts off kinda catching your eye, and then as it goes further into the plot, it just makes no sense, and don't get me started about the ending!!!!"
862,tt0450345,7537,5,What was that.
863,tt0450345,7537,6,"The only thing that makes this movie exist is Nicolas Cage usual great humor, and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations."
864,tt0450345,7537,7,"If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch, save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn put some thing on fire and when some ones asks you why, just say the stupidest thing that comes into your mind, and there you go!"
865,tt0450345,7538,1,"I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, I found it strange and completely pointless... so I decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it."
866,tt0450345,7538,2,Wow. what a difference.
867,tt0450345,7538,3,The original one was way better.
868,tt0450345,7538,4,"I'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement, it's existence did have a purpose."
869,tt0450345,7538,5,It was really the Christian public expressing their fear of paganism.
870,tt0450345,7538,6,"If you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but I don't want to go into details, just, simply put, if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it SHOULD look like, feel free to watch the 70s version, a little dated, but A lot better."
871,tt0450345,7539,1,Where oh where to begin in describing the comprehensive wretchedness of Neil LaBute's latest attempt at film making.
872,tt0450345,7539,2,"There are many kinds of film fans out there, but by far the most annoying and shallow is Mr."
873,tt0450345,7539,3,Intriguing.
874,tt0450345,7539,4,You know Mr.
875,tt0450345,7539,5,"Intriguing, don't you."
876,tt0450345,7539,6,"He's the fellow that no matter how stupid, lame, and incomprehensibly dull a film is, he says ""Gee, I don't know why everyone hated it, I found it intriguing."""
877,tt0450345,7539,7,He's the kind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intriguing.
878,tt0450345,7539,8,Especially when he smears it in the shape of a Hitler mustache on his upper lip and marches about the house ranting about the brilliance of science fiction that features thinly veiled references to Greek mythology.
879,tt0450345,7539,9,He's also the guy this version of The Wicker Man was made for.
880,tt0450345,7539,10,No one else could stand it.
881,tt0450345,7540,1,"The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, is by no means a good movie, but I can't really say it's one I regret watching."
882,tt0450345,7540,2,"I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie, like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a dream sequence with a hallucination, etc., but it's just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this."
883,tt0450345,7540,3,"Instead, here's five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man, even though it's bad: 5."
884,tt0450345,7540,4,"It's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it, the only problem is in its cheesy, unintentionally funny execution."
885,tt0450345,7540,5,"If nothing else, this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film, or even read the short story on which it is based.4."
886,tt0450345,7540,6,"For a cheesy horror/thriller, it is really aesthetically pleasing."
887,tt0450345,7540,7,"It's pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets, so we get to see some very great scenery."
888,tt0450345,7540,8,There are also many nicely composed shots.
889,tt0450345,7540,9,It is a very good looking movie.3.
890,tt0450345,7540,10,Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature.
891,tt0450345,7540,11,"Whether you're a fan of his or not, it seems as if it's impossible for Cage to play a ""normal guy""."
892,tt0450345,7540,12,"There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays, and personally, I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does."
893,tt0450345,7540,13,"Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his unique energy into play, and he is never boring to watch."
894,tt0450345,7540,14,"He is terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful kind of way.2."
895,tt0450345,7540,15,"A student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie, as it seems to be the strongest anti feminist movie ever made."
896,tt0450345,7540,16,"""See."" you could write, ""this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society!"""
897,tt0450345,7540,17,"Also, the similarities between this ""Summersisle"" society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting.1."
898,tt0450345,7540,18,"If you're reading this, there's probably a good chance you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of ""highlights"" from the movie, including Cage running around in a bear suit, and of course, the infamous ""AAGHH!!"
899,tt0450345,7540,19,THE BEES!!
900,tt0450345,7540,20,"MY EYES!!!"""
901,tt0450345,7540,21,line.
902,tt0450345,7540,22,"These scenes are hilarious out of context, and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the film's entirety."
903,tt0450345,7540,23,"I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about 5 dollars...when you work that out, it's about a dollar per reason."
904,tt0450345,7540,24,It's a pretty good deal.
905,tt0450345,7540,25,"NOTE: The Unrated version of the movie is the best to watch, and it's better to watch the Theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue, which features a cameo from James Franco."
906,tt0450345,7541,1,"great mystery, but the film goes down hill from there."
907,tt0450345,7541,2,"The beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer, Edward."
908,tt0450345,7541,3,He is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills.
909,tt0450345,7541,4,A mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter.
910,tt0450345,7541,5,So Ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman.
911,tt0450345,7541,6,They don't like outsiders.
912,tt0450345,7541,7,A lot of filler is with Ed shown looking around town for the girl.
913,tt0450345,7541,8,That made the movie too long.
914,tt0450345,7541,9,It finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for Edward.
915,tt0450345,7541,10,"Overall, not a well written story and too long."
916,tt0450345,7541,11,FINAL VERDICT: I would skip this.
917,tt0450345,7542,1,"This movie is suppose to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl."
918,tt0450345,7542,2,"However, 30 minutes into the movie, it turns into a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes."
919,tt0450345,7542,3,"I can't imagine anyone not laughing when Cage randomly Karate kicks that blonde girl or when he ""bear"" punches that old lady."
920,tt0450345,7542,4,"The lines, characters, and acting are all poorly done from the get go."
921,tt0450345,7542,5,"I've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he has made some terrible movies this year; this being by far the worst one yet...."
922,tt0450345,7542,6,I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense story gripping thriller.
923,tt0450345,7542,7,"If you really want to enjoy this story, go rent the original."
924,tt0450345,7542,8,"However, if you intend on watching it, get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously; that's the only way you enjoy this film."
925,tt0450345,7543,1,A trooper is on the side of the road making sure every1 is obeying the speed limit doing his job; he then pulls over a woman who appears she is a mother there is a child in the back seat; he then is telling her what is wrong and BAM...they get killed.
926,tt0450345,7543,2,"Okay, this is the start of what i personally thought would have been a good movie."
927,tt0450345,7543,3,When I was watching this movie in the theatre I was with some friends.
928,tt0450345,7543,4,This was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie.
929,tt0450345,7543,5,We all decided to see a suspense/thriller that looked good to everyone in the group...this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life.
930,tt0450345,7543,6,"Not only did I waste $7.oo on a movie ticket, but I had to sit through torture for the brain."
931,tt0450345,7543,7,"This movie started off with mystery and suspense and I seriously thought ""this cant be bad""..."
932,tt0450345,7543,8,I was so wrong.
933,tt0450345,7543,9,"The whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense; even if you can get passed the bad acting, the ""not so scary"" storyline, and the over all horrible mess this movie was, you will still be puzzled."
934,tt0450345,7543,10,"It's not because you're not smart enough to understand it, it's because no human with a brain could comprehend what this stupid movie is about."
935,tt0450345,7543,11,"Right now you may be thinking ""Oh man!"
936,tt0450345,7543,12,"I have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says it is""."
937,tt0450345,7543,13,GET THAT THOUGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW!!!
938,tt0450345,7543,14,I'm trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it is so bad that there is no point in even considering seeing it.
939,tt0450345,7543,15,Please people don't make the same mistake i did thinking that this movie has potential...it doesn't.
940,tt0450345,7543,16,"I give this movie 1 out of 10 if I could give a zero I would, and I do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie, you'll be saving yourself many sleepless nights trying to think w.t.f. that freaking movie is about."
941,tt0450345,7544,1,First this movie was not that bad.
942,tt0450345,7544,2,It was entertaining...at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons.
943,tt0450345,7544,3,I have never seen the original so can't compare the two.
944,tt0450345,7544,4,This movie reminded me of that weird Christopher Reeve movie Village of the Damned.
945,tt0450345,7544,5,"THe two movies have different plots, but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both."
946,tt0450345,7544,6,The wicker man is suppose to be a mystery/thriller/men please don't anger the women movie.
947,tt0450345,7544,7,I don't know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off.
948,tt0450345,7544,8,"Nicholas Cage, his glorious bad self goes to a secluded Island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fianc√©e who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders."
949,tt0450345,7544,9,Cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world.
950,tt0450345,7544,10,Stupid.
951,tt0450345,7544,11,Things get weirder when the large Amish esquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl.
952,tt0450345,7544,12,His fianc√©e is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time.
953,tt0450345,7544,13,Cage stays on the Island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival.
954,tt0450345,7544,14,In this movie males do not fare so well.
955,tt0450345,7544,15,A sick twisted display of feminism.
956,tt0450345,7544,16,I found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit.
957,tt0450345,7544,17,I think there were too many potholes in this movie.
958,tt0450345,7544,18,"I find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining, but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird."
959,tt0450345,7544,19,While most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism.
960,tt0450345,7544,20,I would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed.
961,tt0450345,7544,21,This movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice.
962,tt0450345,7544,22,It is NOT a thriller it should be categorized as just strange.
963,tt0450345,7545,1,It's unfortunate that you can't go any lower than one star.
964,tt0450345,7545,2,"Prior to watching The Wicker Man, I had considered Aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars."
965,tt0450345,7545,3,"In all fairness, The Wicker Man doesn't detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film, but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it."
966,tt0450345,7545,4,There is a cheap trick all too often used in Hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion: slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful.
967,tt0450345,7545,5,It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers.
968,tt0450345,7545,6,"Even more so in that the ""carefully crafted"" or however they put it conclusion didn't seem to follow logically from the plot which naturally I can't elaborate on without introducing spoilers, and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point."
969,tt0450345,7545,7,"It is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly die hard Nicholas Cage fans, but only to a few of the mainstream audience."
970,tt0450345,7545,8,"If you really want something along these lines, I heartily recommend M."
971,tt0450345,7545,9,Night Shyamalan's The Village instead.
972,tt0450345,7545,10,"Lacking some kind of memory erasing pill, I suppose I need to watch something better to force it from my mind, say, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Pee wee's Big Adventure."
973,tt0450345,7546,1,I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this.
974,tt0450345,7546,2,"I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once...but trust me, it is."
975,tt0450345,7546,3,I haven't seen the old movie..but why would they want to remake a movie like this.
976,tt0450345,7546,4,The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic.
977,tt0450345,7546,5,This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.
978,tt0450345,7546,6,"I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point , but it never does."
979,tt0450345,7546,7,So this movie is a big no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans.
980,tt0450345,7546,8,You could probably for it show up on television.
981,tt0450345,7547,1,"Waitress: Honey, here's them eggs you ordered."
982,tt0450345,7547,2,"Honey, like bee, get it."
983,tt0450345,7547,3,That's called pointless foreshadowing.
984,tt0450345,7547,4,Edward Basket: Huh.
985,tt0450345,7547,5,"On the road Basket: Here's your doll back, little girl."
986,tt0450345,7547,6,You really shouldn't be so careless with your belongings.
987,tt0450345,7547,7,"Little girl: Yeah, whatever."
988,tt0450345,7547,8,Crash!
989,tt0450345,7547,9,Boom!
990,tt0450345,7547,10,Whoosh!
991,tt0450345,7547,11,Crackle¬Ö Basket: I think that something bad is about to happen.
992,tt0450345,7547,12,Later Basket: Mmmm.
993,tt0450345,7547,13,Vicodin!
994,tt0450345,7547,14,What the¬Ö .
995,tt0450345,7547,15,Tears open letter.
996,tt0450345,7547,16,Wow!
997,tt0450345,7547,17,My ex girl's handwriting has really improved.
998,tt0450345,7547,18,"And look, her missing daughter looks kinda like the girl with the doll I accidentally was sort of responsible for getting killed, in a way."
999,tt0450345,7547,19,And she kind of has my hairline.
1000,tt0450345,7547,20,"I wonder, should I torture myself and go find her."
1001,tt0450345,7547,21,Let's see what my friends at the precinct think.
1002,tt0450345,7547,22,Basket's fellow male cop: HAHAHA.
1003,tt0450345,7547,23,Willow's a funny name.
1004,tt0450345,7547,24,Basket: I think that something bad is about to happen.
1005,tt0450345,7547,25,On the island Basket: What's in the sack.
1006,tt0450345,7547,26,"AHHH.Tree named crone: It's not her daughter, though."
1007,tt0450345,7547,27,In the tavern Basket: Can you swing that.
1008,tt0450345,7547,28,"Big boned, tree named tavern wench: Huh."
1009,tt0450345,7547,29,Basket: smashes a bee.
1010,tt0450345,7547,30,"Everything is OK.Sensually pretty, formerly promising actress playing a lusty tavern scullery maid: That's good."
1011,tt0450345,7547,31,"Honey's not a plant, though."
1012,tt0450345,7547,32,"On the greensward Willow: Oh, yeah, and I forgot, you are the father my child, Conan, er, I mean Rowen."
1013,tt0450345,7547,33,Yawns.
1014,tt0450345,7547,34,I could have stayed and had a life with you.
1015,tt0450345,7547,35,But I didn't.
1016,tt0450345,7547,36,"I wanted to be princess of the beehive, instead."
1017,tt0450345,7547,37,"I mean, never mind."
1018,tt0450345,7547,38,"Nods off, jerks awake, widens eyes to anime proportions."
1019,tt0450345,7547,39,"Mwah, kiss kiss."
1020,tt0450345,7547,40,Love ya!
1021,tt0450345,7547,41,What were we talking about.
1022,tt0450345,7547,42,Basket: Who burned it.
1023,tt0450345,7547,43,Who burned it.
1024,tt0450345,7547,44,Who burned it.
1025,tt0450345,7547,45,Who burned it.
1026,tt0450345,7547,46,Who burned it.
1027,tt0450345,7547,47,Willow: Edward.
1028,tt0450345,7547,48,Sniff.
1029,tt0450345,7547,49,Blink.
1030,tt0450345,7547,50,Why.
1031,tt0450345,7547,51,Are.
1032,tt0450345,7547,52,You.
1033,tt0450345,7547,53,Yelling.
1034,tt0450345,7547,54,At.
1035,tt0450345,7547,55,Me.
1036,tt0450345,7547,56,Is it because I jacked your Vicodin.
1037,tt0450345,7547,57,Sniff.
1038,tt0450345,7547,58,Snore.
1039,tt0450345,7547,59,What were we talking about.
1040,tt0450345,7547,60,Basket: I think something bad is about to happen.
1041,tt0450345,7547,61,Willow: My lips hurt.
1042,tt0450345,7547,62,In the schoolroom Rose: What is man.
1043,tt0450345,7547,63,"Unappealling twins, in unison: Phallic symbol, phallic symbol."
1044,tt0450345,7547,64,Rose: Echo.
1045,tt0450345,7547,65,Echo.
1046,tt0450345,7547,66,Basket: Step away from the bike.
1047,tt0450345,7547,67,Rose: And I'm the good twin.
1048,tt0450345,7547,68,Basket: I think something bad is about to happen.
1049,tt0450345,7547,69,At the beehives Basket: Hmmm.
1050,tt0450345,7547,70,Hallo.
1051,tt0450345,7547,71,"Ow, ow, ow, oh bother."
1052,tt0450345,7547,72,Silly old bear.
1053,tt0450345,7547,73,Snore.
1054,tt0450345,7547,74,At the Queen Bee's mansion Sister Summersisle: You have so much potential.
1055,tt0450345,7547,75,What are you doing here.
1056,tt0450345,7547,76,Weren't you the stud Cher slapped in the face in Moonstruck.
1057,tt0450345,7547,77,Licks lips.
1058,tt0450345,7547,78,Basket: I was about to ask you the same thing.
1059,tt0450345,7547,79,Where's the girl.
1060,tt0450345,7547,80,Sister Summersisle: How you drone on.
1061,tt0450345,7547,81,"Let's talk about the significance of my superfluous ""s."""
1062,tt0450345,7547,82,Basket: Look out for that semi truck barreling toward us!
1063,tt0450345,7547,83,Aaaaah!
1064,tt0450345,7547,84,Oh.
1065,tt0450345,7547,85,Never mind.
1066,tt0450345,7547,86,Goddammit!
1067,tt0450345,7547,87,Pops another pill.
1068,tt0450345,7547,88,Mmmm.
1069,tt0450345,7547,89,Thorazine.
1070,tt0450345,7547,90,"Back at the tavern Big boned, supercilious tavern wench: I've tried Weightwatchers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and I still went up a bear suit size since last year."
1071,tt0450345,7547,91,Tree named crone: HAHAHA.
1072,tt0450345,7547,92,"All the better to roast that nosy cop in, my dear."
1073,tt0450345,7547,93,Big boned wench: Totally.
1074,tt0450345,7547,94,Basket: That was the last straw that broke the Basket Case's back!
1075,tt0450345,7547,95,"Take that, wench!"
1076,tt0450345,7547,96,Slugs her.
1077,tt0450345,7547,97,Edward Basket is mysteriously attacked from behind Voluptuous tavern wench: EEEE!
1078,tt0450345,7547,98,Snap out of it!
1079,tt0450345,7547,99,Leave the island already and take me with you!
1080,tt0450345,7547,100,Do I have to tackle you or what.
1081,tt0450345,7547,101,"Snap out of it, I say!"
1082,tt0450345,7547,102,EEEE!
1083,tt0450345,7547,103,"Basket: Take that, wench!"
1084,tt0450345,7547,104,Courageously kicks her in the face.
1085,tt0450345,7547,105,Her eyes roll back in her head and become cartoon Xs.
1086,tt0450345,7547,106,Voluptuous wench: Snore¬Ö At the Nicolas Cage roast Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the part where Basket's cell phone rings in the middle of his bear suit scene and then the call gets dropped.
1087,tt0450345,7547,107,It's like a wireless ad: Help me!
1088,tt0450345,7547,108,Can you hear me now.
1089,tt0450345,7547,109,Hahaha.
1090,tt0450345,7547,110,Kate Beahan: And remember when I produced the bullets I jacked from Basket's gun.
1091,tt0450345,7547,111,He looked so surprised.
1092,tt0450345,7547,112,"You should be more careful with your belongings, Nick."
1093,tt0450345,7547,113,Hahaha.
1094,tt0450345,7547,114,And your movie choices.
1095,tt0450345,7547,115,All: The drone must die!

1097,tt0450345,7547,117,"Well, roasting me isn't gonna help your goddamn honey!"
1098,tt0450345,7547,118,Aaah.
1099,tt0450345,7547,119,My legs!
1100,tt0450345,7547,120,"Honey, honey, get it. put down that torch and step away from the Basket Case."
1101,tt0450345,7547,121,Honey!
1102,tt0450345,7547,122,Smokey bear says don't play with matches.
1103,tt0450345,7547,123,Hahaha.
1104,tt0450345,7547,124,What the¬Ö.
1105,tt0450345,7547,125,Look out for that hurtling semi truck!
1106,tt0450345,7547,126,Ahh!
1107,tt0450345,7547,127,Oh.
1108,tt0450345,7547,128,"Goddammit, these flashbacks from my drug experimentation phase in the seventies are getting old!"
1109,tt0450345,7547,129,Where's my heroin.
1110,tt0450345,7547,130,Ouch.
1111,tt0450345,7547,131,Ouch.
1112,tt0450345,7547,132,My watch isn't fireproof.
1113,tt0450345,7547,133,Ouch.
1114,tt0450345,7547,134,I think something bad is about to happen.
1115,tt0450345,7547,135,Can you hear me now.
1116,tt0450345,7547,136,I'm ready for my close up.
1117,tt0450345,7547,137,Goddammit!
1118,tt0450345,7547,138,Six months later Voluptuous wench in modern day slutty attire: I told that eponymous Basket Case to take me with him.
1119,tt0450345,7547,139,Innocent young drone: I like to help people.
1120,tt0450345,7547,140,Volptuous wench: Then get me out of my contract for the sequel!
1121,tt0450345,7547,141,I think something bad is about to happen.
1122,tt0450345,7547,142,EEEEE!
1123,tt0450345,7548,1,Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness.
1124,tt0450345,7548,2,I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re release of The Excorcist¬Ö really nervous laughter.
1125,tt0450345,7548,3,It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl.
1126,tt0450345,7548,4,"In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however, it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character, Scuzzlebut, the friendly forest monster with TV's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film."
1127,tt0450345,7548,5,I started laughing and my friend Keith got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor.
1128,tt0450345,7548,6,I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right.
1129,tt0450345,7548,7,"Gone is the realness, the outstanding original music, the originality, the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue."
1130,tt0450345,7548,8,"Instead we have horror movie clich√©s, affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart."
1131,tt0450345,7548,9,"Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground ""playing Wickerman""."
1132,tt0450345,7548,10,The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison.
1133,tt0450345,7548,11,In the new spin a California cop Cage is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex girlfriend to find her missing daughter.
1134,tt0450345,7548,12,She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago.
1135,tt0450345,7548,13,The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found.
1136,tt0450345,7548,14,"Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north, alone, to help his ex girlfriend find her daughter."
1137,tt0450345,7548,15,"He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans, many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village."
1138,tt0450345,7548,16,And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here.
1139,tt0450345,7548,17,Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.
1140,tt0450345,7548,18,I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry.
1141,tt0450345,7548,19,I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks.
1142,tt0450345,7548,20,We needed a bad re make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another '9 11' movie.
1143,tt0450345,7548,21,I'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so.
1144,tt0450345,7549,1,If Edward Woodward was the the flicks watching this film then that's what he would scream out in horror.
1145,tt0450345,7549,2,I'm sorry folks but enough's enough.
1146,tt0450345,7549,3,"We had Get Carter, The Italian Job, Alfie and now this."
1147,tt0450345,7549,4,What's the similarities.
1148,tt0450345,7549,5,No.
1149,tt0450345,7549,6,It's not exactly a coincidence that three of the originals star Maurice Micklewhite and the other stars another great British actor.
1150,tt0450345,7549,7,The main common ingredient in those originals IS the britishness of the films.
1151,tt0450345,7549,8,They weren't made to impress Hollywood.
1152,tt0450345,7549,9,They were quirky English films with a unique charm/atmosphere that just cannot be replicated in the USA.
1153,tt0450345,7549,10,The word is CULT and what better way to destroy a cult film than to bastardise it with a remake or even a sequel.
1154,tt0450345,7549,11,Wicker 06 had a tough task before it even hit the road.
1155,tt0450345,7549,12,"Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic that other said cult films; it defies genre, intelligent scripts, A grade actors, the music score, set pieces that defy description and all the stories surrounding the film."
1156,tt0450345,7549,13,So here comes a remake.
1157,tt0450345,7549,14,Don't worry.
1158,tt0450345,7549,15,No originals were harmed in the making of this remake.
1159,tt0450345,7549,16,"Some major aspects of the story needed to be reworked for the modern USA communications, paganism, virgins."
1160,tt0450345,7549,17,But that's just about the whole premise.
1161,tt0450345,7549,18,So we give the cop a Nam style trauma past complete with shock music flashbacks for the cheap scares.
1162,tt0450345,7549,19,Then with no mobile phone mast on the island that sorts the communication out but in the real world this wouldn't happen.
1163,tt0450345,7549,20,Cops just don't go missing.
1164,tt0450345,7549,21,Give him a blood link for motivation rather than the clash of beliefs and you have the remake.
1165,tt0450345,7549,22,"Wafer thin though, isn't it."
1166,tt0450345,7549,23,It's just that it was all laid on with a trowel.
1167,tt0450345,7549,24,"The name alterations were simply hammy, almost Carry On, there was no sense of community on the island, no centre of town to catch your bearings, just a few houses dotted about a forest and that was it."
1168,tt0450345,7549,25,Willow was just annoying by not giving out any info at all and Cage was useless to let her get away with it.
1169,tt0450345,7549,26,When he went into the well you just knew he would get locked it.
1170,tt0450345,7549,27,The screenplay was signposted all the way to the end and you just wanted it to hurry up and end.
1171,tt0450345,7549,28,The epilogue was absolutely hilarious and didn't know when to stop.
1172,tt0450345,7549,29,That ending is probably the best way to summarise the difference between the two.
1173,tt0450345,7549,30,One ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrific day.
1174,tt0450345,7549,31,The other ends with a post production explain it all to the thickies type conclusion.
1175,tt0450345,7549,32,I loved the original but went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the film.
1176,tt0450345,7549,33,I left thankful in the knowledge that this film will probably end up beneath a highway somewhere only this time mercifully forgotten forever.
1177,tt0450345,7550,1,"OK, so I am an original Wicker Man fan and I usually don't like British films remade by Americans, so why oh why did I put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever."
1178,tt0450345,7550,2,I am not a Nicolas Cage fan and I had some kind of moment of madness perhaps.
1179,tt0450345,7550,3,The film was appalling!
1180,tt0450345,7550,4,"The bit at the beginning with the crash/fire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where Edward was going, so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland, well it wouldn't have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated."
1181,tt0450345,7550,5,The history behind the wicker man wasn't really explored and I guess being set in America didn't really help the whole pagan theme.
1182,tt0450345,7550,6,This film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense.
1183,tt0450345,7550,7,"I must say that the best bit was right at the end, when Nicolas Cage goes up in flames!"
1184,tt0450345,7550,8,"I am in such desperate need to see the original again now, in order to cleanse my disappointed soul."
1185,tt0450345,7550,9,"I really can't stress how disappointing this film is, please don't see it if you:A Don't like American re makes of British Films B Are a fan of the original C Hate Nicolas Cage"
1186,tt0450345,7551,1,"Well, finally got to see the remake last night in London, unintentionally hilarious, sexless and devoid of any real humour."
1187,tt0450345,7551,2,"I don't really know where to start, whilst I was entertained by this strange homage, it didn't really move me."
1188,tt0450345,7551,3,"The acting is screamingly hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are far too 'Disney' there is a ridiculous 'six months later' insert after the burning of Nic Cage which didn't come soon enough for my liking The bit with Cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various 'baddies' on the island."
1189,tt0450345,7551,4,"It's such a weird remake that I cant quite believe I saw it, it reminded me of something that The Comic Strip presents would have done in the eighties, a bit like their Hollywood interpretation of the Miner's Strike, very strange!"
1190,tt0450345,7552,1,The Wicker Man Has Done The Impossible!
1191,tt0450345,7552,2,It replaced Cat Woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind.
1192,tt0450345,7552,3,YES it's really that bad.
1193,tt0450345,7552,4,"So bad that when sitting down to write this review I thought to myself ""If I had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes"" I might actually go for the red hot needles."
1194,tt0450345,7552,5,"Neil LaBute created a rare movie where Joel Schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind ""Yeah that's some bad direction right there""."
1195,tt0450345,7552,6,"I think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line: ""Some Sacrifices Must Be Made""."
1196,tt0450345,7552,7,Sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen.
1197,tt0450345,7552,8,Trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime..or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment.
1198,tt0450345,7552,9,Seriously!
1199,tt0450345,7552,10,The movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and I would still rather with be stuck on Gilligans Island with only pictures of Condoleezza Rice then find myself stranded there.
1200,tt0450345,7552,11,The most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater.
1201,tt0450345,7552,12,That's not a joke nor is it fictional.
1202,tt0450345,7552,13,"I've never been to a ""thriller"" and heard so much laughter through out the entire film."
1203,tt0450345,7552,14,I can't tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly.
1204,tt0450345,7552,15,"I honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater, anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since Deez, Powder and I pounded 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia soon to be a law before all Nic Cage films, write to your congressman today, don't delay."
1205,tt0450345,7552,16,At one point I actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and Anna Ferris is going to show up¬Öoh how I wish.
1206,tt0450345,7552,17,Nic Cage throws out so much ham per frame I'm thinking of having a cholesterol test done today.
1207,tt0450345,7552,18,"To think that I ever thought Sean Penn was a dck for slamming Nic's acting, oh he's still a dck just lesser of one¬Öyes Sean Penn's dck was lessened because of this film."
1208,tt0450345,7552,19,Do us all a favor Nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks.
1209,tt0450345,7552,20,You cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars.
1210,tt0450345,7552,21,"His best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit like the fart, not a joke or a functional moment during this review then proceeds to run amok like Conan O'Brian's masturbating bear, but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around."
1211,tt0450345,7552,22,Thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he's to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of Burning Man and Lilith Fair.
1212,tt0450345,7552,23,Yes!!!!
1213,tt0450345,7552,24,I just spoiled the ending for you¬Öand if you knew any better you'd build statues of me in worship and sing songs of my legend.
1214,tt0450345,7552,25,I sat through this crap fest so you don't have to.
1215,tt0450345,7552,26,About half way through this little misadventure I kept thinking to myself Jack Bauer would have wrapped this case up in 20 minutes of real time..
1216,tt0450345,7552,27,OK 35 minutes if Kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first.
1217,tt0450345,7552,28,Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau could have figured this out in under an hour¬Öand you Sir are no Inspector Clouseau.
1218,tt0450345,7552,29,"If for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet, take the bullet."
1219,tt0450345,7552,30,Somewhere Uwe Boll is laughing at us all.
1220,tt0450345,7553,1,A phenomenal achievement in awfulness.
1221,tt0450345,7553,2,It's actually hilariously awful.
1222,tt0450345,7553,3,First off...
1223,tt0450345,7553,4,Nicholas Cage must now have made it to the finals in the Over Emoting Category in his acting class.
1224,tt0450345,7553,5,"Wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a ""hero"" character that you have no vested interest in."
1225,tt0450345,7553,6,I don't know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters.
1226,tt0450345,7553,7,"He makes females out to be totally deviant and evil...and pays them back by having Cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all ""bes"" a few times too."
1227,tt0450345,7553,8,I've enjoyed LaBute's early films and a few of his plays...but it's a strange fascination he has.
1228,tt0450345,7553,9,I'd give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on Ellen Burstyn's performance.
1229,tt0450345,7553,10,By the time she finally makes her appearance bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead it seems like all hope may be lost.
1230,tt0450345,7553,11,"She deserves an Oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue, white, and gold face paint booming about The Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well."
1231,tt0450345,7553,12,This movie is so wrong headed and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed.
1232,tt0450345,7553,13,Highlights include: Nicholas Cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill.
1233,tt0450345,7553,14,Nicholas Cage stealing a bicycle and looking like Ms.
1234,tt0450345,7553,15,Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding around on it.
1235,tt0450345,7553,16,Nicholas Cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl.
1236,tt0450345,7553,17,"Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a once promising acting career in a ""brawl"" with Cage."
1237,tt0450345,7553,18,Ellen Burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu.
1238,tt0450345,7553,19,"Nicholas Cage screaming ""Who burned it."
1239,tt0450345,7553,20,Who burned it.
1240,tt0450345,7553,21,Who burned it.
1241,tt0450345,7553,22,Who burned it.
1242,tt0450345,7553,23,Who burned it.
1243,tt0450345,7553,24,"Who burned it."" for no reason."
1244,tt0450345,7553,25,"Nicholas Cage in a bear costume I'm not kidding running through the woods, taking off the costume but leaving the bear feet on and then doing some karate moves to some villains."
1245,tt0450345,7553,26,And you haven't lived until you have seen the final 15 minutes of the movie and its dreadful epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin's basement.
1246,tt0450345,7553,27,"Needless to say, if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a medal."
1247,tt0450345,7553,28,"There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped snickering to wonder if maybe this wasn't an elaborate send up of ""hysteria"" films...only to be reminded when Cage would scream/shout/whisper his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously."
1248,tt0450345,7553,29,I think this one is destined to be a cult film all over again...just because it's so dreadful.
1249,tt0450345,7554,1,"I have never seen the 1973, older highly rated version."
1250,tt0450345,7554,2,"I am a Nicholas Cage fan by the way, fine acting as usual."
1251,tt0450345,7554,3,"This movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot I can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party, if you can't figure out the ending of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this movie entertaining."
1252,tt0450345,7554,4,"This is, of late, the terrible rut that Hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror/mystery/thriller genre, unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh, smart, and tantalizing screenplay, they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater."
1253,tt0450345,7554,5,"At least, it didn't have the jiggling hand held camera syndrome."
1254,tt0450345,7555,1,Don't let the premise fool you this was one funny movie.
1255,tt0450345,7555,2,The problem it wasn't supposed to be a comedy.
1256,tt0450345,7555,3,The story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes.
1257,tt0450345,7555,4,"Even worse, the set up is NEVER explained."
1258,tt0450345,7555,5,"You will leave the theater asking ""Is that it."""
1259,tt0450345,7555,6,"I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat."
1260,tt0450345,7555,7,"Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with."
1261,tt0450345,7555,8,"There are odd quirks, and interesting turns everywhere, which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie."
1262,tt0450345,7555,9,Let this one come out on video before wasting your money.
1263,tt0450345,7556,1,Everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful.
1264,tt0450345,7556,2,"I wasn't going to comment, but the film just bugs me so much, and the writer/director in particular."
1265,tt0450345,7556,3,So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers.
1266,tt0450345,7556,4,"I saw the original ""Wicker Man"" and really loved the cornucopia of music, sensuality, paganism in a modern world, and the clash of theological beliefs."
1267,tt0450345,7556,5,"This said, I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done."
1268,tt0450345,7556,6,"For example, I liked the original 1950's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake."
1269,tt0450345,7556,7,Both films can stand on their own.
1270,tt0450345,7556,8,"Another example is ""The Thing""."
1271,tt0450345,7556,9,"The original, as campy as it looks compared to today's standards, has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell my all time favorite horror movie."
1272,tt0450345,7556,10,"So that small minority of people who like ""The Wicker Man"" re make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it's a re make."
1273,tt0450345,7556,11,This film solidified for me Neil LaBute's sexism and misogynistic tendencies.
1274,tt0450345,7556,12,"It also made me wonder how executives, wanting to make a serious thriller, would green light a product that is so anti female."
1275,tt0450345,7556,13,There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl. would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming.
1276,tt0450345,7556,14,The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion.
1277,tt0450345,7556,15,"The threat to the main character came from everyone, male and female."
1278,tt0450345,7556,16,There was no sexual hierarchy.
1279,tt0450345,7556,17,"The metaphor of bees, drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient ""The drone must die!"", especially when Cage's character has bee allergies."
1280,tt0450345,7556,18,I kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts.
1281,tt0450345,7556,19,"These were not women with special supernatural powers, and half of them seemed to be pregnant, the other half old and fat, and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs, so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women."
1282,tt0450345,7556,20,Physically dominate them.
1283,tt0450345,7556,21,There didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy.
1284,tt0450345,7556,22,"But if they were content being drones, why make them unable to speak."
1285,tt0450345,7556,23,They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community.
1286,tt0450345,7556,24,They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated.
1287,tt0450345,7556,25,That movie was made already.
1288,tt0450345,7556,26,"""The Stepford Wives"" anyone."
1289,tt0450345,7556,27,Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sht together and were truly equal citizens.
1290,tt0450345,7556,28,The problem with the man hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out.
1291,tt0450345,7556,29,"I belief LaBute should've left the society an egalitarian one, kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness, and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island."
1292,tt0450345,7556,30,No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited.
1293,tt0450345,7556,31,So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around.
1294,tt0450345,7556,32,"There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused, thus, an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children."
1295,tt0450345,7556,33,LaBute has said he created the fianc√© and daughter story thread to give Cage's character an incentive to search.
1296,tt0450345,7556,34,I don't think you need that.
1297,tt0450345,7556,35,Any child abused will make an adult react to save them.
1298,tt0450345,7556,36,"The irony of course would be that the child Cage ""saves"" ultimately brings him death."
1299,tt0450345,7556,37,The dialogue was contrived and campy.
1300,tt0450345,7556,38,The whole third act was hilarious.
1301,tt0450345,7556,39,The audience I saw it with guffawed and later booed at the end.
1302,tt0450345,7556,40,I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is.
1303,tt0450345,7556,41,We don't need that.
1304,tt0450345,7556,42,Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child.
1305,tt0450345,7556,43,"Most of us in America have seen ""Law & Order"" and other cop procedurals."
1306,tt0450345,7556,44,We come into the movie as if we are Cage's partner solving a mystery.
1307,tt0450345,7556,45,So much potential...wasted.
1308,tt0450345,7556,46,"Neil LaBute, stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst ridden plays and flicks of that sort."
1309,tt0450345,7556,47,Stay with your own company of men.
1310,tt0450345,7556,48,Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers.
1311,tt0450345,7556,49,Here is your jar of honey.
1312,tt0450345,7556,50,I'll watch that.
1313,tt0450345,7557,1,This film was terrible.
1314,tt0450345,7557,2,"OK, my favourite film is 'The Wicker Man' 1973, so I was always bound to be a little biased."
1315,tt0450345,7557,3,"The plot rambles along, throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious."
1316,tt0450345,7557,4,"He's not a virgin, but IS allergic to bees."
1317,tt0450345,7557,5,WOW!
1318,tt0450345,7557,6,"So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained, which I'm afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make."
1319,tt0450345,7557,7,How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film.
1320,tt0450345,7557,8,"Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout, and his character is prone to calling out ""Rowan!."" at the slightest noise."
1321,tt0450345,7557,9,The 'nods' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage.
1322,tt0450345,7557,10,"For example, certain incidents mirror the original The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when Woodward/Cage is searching the island and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in."
1323,tt0450345,7557,11,"I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this, I really can't be bothered to write any more about this film."
1324,tt0450345,7557,12,It lacks any kind of substance.
1325,tt0450345,7557,13,Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were 'based' on in this case very loosely.
1326,tt0450345,7558,1,what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless. movie.
1327,tt0450345,7558,2,A remake that did not need to be retold.
1328,tt0450345,7558,3,Everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments.
1329,tt0450345,7558,4,Worst movie I ever saw.
1330,tt0450345,7558,5,Save your time and money!!!
1331,tt0450345,7558,6,"Nicgolas Cage was biking down hills, swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene."
1332,tt0450345,7558,7,Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself.
1333,tt0450345,7558,8,It is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies.
1334,tt0450345,7558,9,Don't they get a copy of the script first.
1335,tt0450345,7558,10,If you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on DVD.
1336,tt0450345,7559,1,This has got to be one of the worst fillums I've ever seen and I've seen a few.
1337,tt0450345,7559,2,"It is slow, boring, amateurish not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot."
1338,tt0450345,7559,3,The actors do not act.
1339,tt0450345,7559,4,I can't blame them they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in SummersIsle.
1340,tt0450345,7559,5,There is not one moment in this film that rings true not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved.
1341,tt0450345,7559,6,The Nicholas Cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations.
1342,tt0450345,7559,7,I have no doubt that I was seeing a suffering man up there but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career.
1343,tt0450345,7560,1,"How this film could miss so many of the fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable."
1344,tt0450345,7560,2,"An unbelievably thin and unengaging plot, ankle deep characterisation/motivation and a really awful soundtrack replacing tension with vast swathes of noise, replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars."
1345,tt0450345,7560,3,"Then there are the specific references to the original which are merely ""plastered on"" over the cracks..."
1346,tt0450345,7560,4,Dreadful.
1347,tt0450345,7560,5,"In a world where gormless, brain dead Amerikan remakes of The Italian Job a tear appears, Get Carter sobs uncontrollably and Alfie have desecrated our screens recently, this one takes the proverbial biscuit."
1348,tt0450345,7560,6,Execrable nonsense.
1349,tt0450345,7560,7,How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a wonder...
1350,tt0450345,7560,8,Rubbish.
1351,tt0450345,7561,1,"Anyone not aware of the 1973 original British Lion movie ' The Wicker Man' would,no doubt, have left the cinema with the impression 'Poor' and 'Peurile'."
1352,tt0450345,7561,2,As a devotee of the original I left with the impression Purely Poor.
1353,tt0450345,7561,3,"From the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote Scottish island, named Summerislethe original to a near Amazon ic colony off the Maine coast of the US, named Summersisle, the remake hardly hits the spot."
1354,tt0450345,7561,4,"This is, quite sadly, a case of what 'could' have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public."
1355,tt0450345,7561,5,NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS.
1356,tt0450345,7561,6,Gentlemen or given the reworked context of the film Ladies involved ... hang your heads in shame.
1357,tt0450345,7562,1,"I haven't seen the original, but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year."
1358,tt0450345,7562,2,Maybe even in two years.
1359,tt0450345,7562,3,I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it.
1360,tt0450345,7562,4,I'll give it two positive nods: The sarcasm of Cage's character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful.
1361,tt0450345,7562,5,"Sorry, that's it."
1362,tt0450345,7562,6,Here come the jeers.
1363,tt0450345,7562,7,The movie's plot is only propelled forward because other characters won't give Cage any straight answers and he puts up with this!!!
1364,tt0450345,7562,8,How this could go on for over an hour of my timemuch less days in the movie is beyond me.
1365,tt0450345,7562,9,Not to mention that the plot is full of holes.
1366,tt0450345,7562,10,You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library.
1367,tt0450345,7562,11,"How anyone could read this script and think, ""Yes, people should pay $11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like"" is beyond me."
1368,tt0450345,7562,12,Do not go see this flick.
1369,tt0450345,7562,13,Or even rent it on DVD.
1370,tt0450345,7563,1,"Unfortunately, this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original."
1371,tt0450345,7563,2,"Nicholas Cage, fairly wooden as far as actors go, imbues the screen with a range of skill from, non plussed to over the top."
1372,tt0450345,7563,3,The supporting cast is no better.
1373,tt0450345,7563,4,The plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse.
1374,tt0450345,7563,5,Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold.
1375,tt0450345,7563,6,It turns out it's just a bill of poor goods.
1376,tt0450345,7563,7,"Disbelief cannot be suspended, nor can a befit of a doubt be given."
1377,tt0450345,7563,8,"The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and whomever scouted the location should be commended."
1378,tt0450345,7563,9,"There was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos, literally, at the end."
1379,tt0450345,7563,10,Disappointed!
1380,tt0450345,7563,11,"Wait for the original to come on television, pour a whiskey and enjoy."
1381,tt0450345,7564,1,The Wicker Man.
1382,tt0450345,7564,2,I am so angry that I cannot write a proper comment about this movie.
1383,tt0450345,7564,3,"The plot was ridiculous, thinly tied together, and altogether just lame."
1384,tt0450345,7564,4,Nicolas Cage...shame on you!
1385,tt0450345,7564,5,"I assumed that since you were in it, that it would be at least decent."
1386,tt0450345,7564,6,It was not.
1387,tt0450345,7564,7,"I felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor, and even if it's complete the movie was just outlandish and silly."
1388,tt0450345,7564,8,"At the end you're left mouth agape, mind befuddled and good taste offended."
1389,tt0450345,7564,9,I have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred.
1390,tt0450345,7564,10,"People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall, four floors down from the theater near the entrance."
1391,tt0450345,7564,11,It's that bad.
1392,tt0450345,7564,12,"I heard it compared to : Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli."
1393,tt0450345,7564,13,My boyfriend was so mad he wouldn't even talk about it.
1394,tt0450345,7564,14,Grrrr!
1395,tt0450345,7565,1,"This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I've spent in a very, very long time."
1396,tt0450345,7565,2,"If you knew how often I went to the movies you'd probably say, that's hard to imagine, but never the less, it's true!"
1397,tt0450345,7565,3,"After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew that I had to see it!"
1398,tt0450345,7565,4,"If you're a fan of horror, mystery, and suspense, why wouldn't you."
1399,tt0450345,7565,5,"The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; unfortunately, the movie is none of these."
1400,tt0450345,7565,6,"From the cinematography, to the script, to the acting, this movie is a complete flop."
1401,tt0450345,7565,7,"If you're reading this, planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills, mystery, action, horror, or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty five minutes I'm afraid you are in for disappointment."""
1402,tt0450345,7565,8,"Why is it so bad,"" you might be asking yourself."
1403,tt0450345,7565,9,Let me tell you.
1404,tt0450345,7565,10,The movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful.
1405,tt0450345,7565,11,"Nothing about the movie made me the least bit ""on edge,"" frightened, or curious."
1406,tt0450345,7565,12,The script was at best laughable.
1407,tt0450345,7565,13,There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't.
1408,tt0450345,7565,14,The acting was absolutely dreadful.
1409,tt0450345,7565,15,I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss.
1410,tt0450345,7565,16,"Without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average."
1411,tt0450345,7565,17,The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique.
1412,tt0450345,7565,18,"Finally, the story is completely transparent."
1413,tt0450345,7565,19,You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away.
1414,tt0450345,7565,20,I am not usually a very harsh critic.
1415,tt0450345,7565,21,"Frankly, when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery/suspense/horror, I just want to be surprised."
1416,tt0450345,7565,22,"This movie was boring, poorly acted, poorly written, and an overwhelming disappointment."
1417,tt0450345,7565,23,Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
1418,tt0450345,7566,1,"Prior to this release, Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original: ""It's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack."
1419,tt0450345,7566,2,"I'm like, come on!"
1420,tt0450345,7566,3,"You may not like the new one, but if that's your favorite soundtrack, I don't know if I want you to like my film."""
1421,tt0450345,7566,4,"Neil, a word."
1422,tt0450345,7566,5,"You might want to sit down for this too; as Lord Summerisle says, shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent."
1423,tt0450345,7566,6,"See, Neil, the thing about the original, is that Paul Giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it."
1424,tt0450345,7566,7,The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical.
1425,tt0450345,7566,8,"Along with Richard and Danny Thompson, and Bert Jansch, it practically kick started the 1970s Folk New Wave."
1426,tt0450345,7566,9,To undermine it is akin to imagining Jaws without John Williams.
1427,tt0450345,7566,10,Or The Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly.
1428,tt0450345,7566,11,"The result's one of the most breathtakingly arrogant, pointless remake of a British cult classic since Sly Stallone's Get Carter."
1429,tt0450345,7566,12,"The original had apparently left Nicolas Cage ""disturbed for about two weeks."""
1430,tt0450345,7566,13,"So disturbed, during that fortnight's window, that he pitched the idea of re imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter faith struggle ever devised to a writer director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism."
1431,tt0450345,7566,14,It's like some parlor game: what would you get if Sam Peckinpah took on Bambi.
1432,tt0450345,7566,15,"Or Gaspar ""Irreversible"" Noe remade Love, Actually."
1433,tt0450345,7566,16,"Actually, I'd quite like to see that."
1434,tt0450345,7566,17,"Unfortunately, someone took this parlor game seriously: All LaBute's succeeded in doing is ripping out the original's guts while saddling it with his own gormless Sex War preoccupations."
1435,tt0450345,7566,18,"After failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash, Cage's highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor."
1436,tt0450345,7566,19,"Then he receives a letter from ex fianc√©e Willow Woodward this one trades on name homages for kudos, now living on the private island community of Summersisle ¬ñ that extra 's' stands for 'superfluous' ¬ñ and wants Edward to help locate missing daughter Rowan."
1437,tt0450345,7566,20,"Summersisle, it transpires, is a female dominated joint, conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the Salem witch trials."
1438,tt0450345,7566,21,"Here, the matriarchs observe the Olde ways, and the few males are near mute breed mules."
1439,tt0450345,7566,22,It's like Lilith Fair on a grand scale.
1440,tt0450345,7566,23,"Summersisle's main export is honey ¬ñ a symbolic and literal headache for Edward, as he's allergic to bees."
1441,tt0450345,7566,24,"""Beekeepers!"""
1442,tt0450345,7566,25,cries Edward.
1443,tt0450345,7566,26,"""They seem to be everywhere on this island!"""
1444,tt0450345,7566,27,"Well, that's probably because Summersisle's main export is honey."
1445,tt0450345,7566,28,"While making his investigations, Edward overhears of an oncoming Mayday ritual called ""the time of death and rebirth""."
1446,tt0450345,7566,29,He discovers the previous year's crop failed; nearly dies from bee stings; and eventually comes to the conclusion a conclusion which admittedly couldn't be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands that Rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest.
1447,tt0450345,7566,30,"He also meets the Queen Bee of the hive, Sister Summersisle Burstyn, who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous Wicker Man: ""The drone must die."""
1448,tt0450345,7566,31,"First, the good news: any concerns Cage would be airlifted from the Wicker Man's flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black CIA helicopters can be laid to rest: he toast."
1449,tt0450345,7566,32,That's about it for the good news.

1451,tt0450345,7566,34,"Though retaining the basic cat and mouse premise and credits typography, what's left subjects the original to a scorched earth policy."
1452,tt0450345,7566,35,"Crucial to Shaffer's original screenplay was that his Christian copper, in accordance with ritual, came to the island of his own free will ¬ñ and most importantly, was a virgin; the perfect sacrifice."
1453,tt0450345,7566,36,"In reducing matters to a sexual, as opposed to a religious power struggle, LaBute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice."
1454,tt0450345,7566,37,"By the time Cage has worked out he was the bait, you honestly couldn't care less."
1455,tt0450345,7566,38,"And Cage is one of the very worst things in this; a lumbering, drawling donkey ¬ñ an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth."

1458,tt0450345,7566,41,"If so, it's a fine portrayal of an undistinguished IQ addled with anti depressants."
1459,tt0450345,7566,42,If not¬Öit doesn't bear thinking about.
1460,tt0450345,7566,43,"As Willow, the saucer eyed Beahan is similarly dreadful, presenting her lines as if in competition with Cage for the¬Ömost¬Öhalf hearted¬Ödelivery."
1461,tt0450345,7566,44,While Burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince.
1462,tt0450345,7566,45,Who's afraid of Naomi Wolf.
1463,tt0450345,7566,46,"Every element that made the original great ¬ñ the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs, the ingenious score, the dialogue Lord Summerisle's majestic ""You did it beautifully!"""
1464,tt0450345,7566,47,"has been replaced with the rather less attractive ""You did it excellently!"""
1465,tt0450345,7566,48,"Whoah, dude!"
1466,tt0450345,7566,49,¬ñ have been substituted for a meandering battle of the sexes thriller with occasional crash bang wallop.
1467,tt0450345,7566,50,"Namely, walloping women; this is a LaBute flick, after all."
1468,tt0450345,7566,51,"Cage's Sister Beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes; impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin' to 'em, hyuk hyuk."
1469,tt0450345,7566,52,"The closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre clich√©: in a bar, two guys run into a couple of Summersisle maidens on shore leave, flirty fishing for fresh martyrs."
1470,tt0450345,7566,53,"At the moment of their successful pick up, you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera."
1471,tt0450345,7566,54,One more thing: keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count anything up to 10 tend to be Not Much Cop.

1473,tt0463392,10088,1,"I am an actor,producer, director and what i am about to say are facts."
1474,tt0463392,10088,2,This project was the worst film in movie making history.
1475,tt0463392,10088,3,From producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a BIG joke.
1476,tt0463392,10088,4,Why would Blockbuster released such crap.
1477,tt0463392,10088,5,I take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession.
1478,tt0463392,10088,6,Was the director trying to make a bad movie.
1479,tt0463392,10088,7,I don't think so.
1480,tt0463392,10088,8,"I seen bad Zombie movies, but this takes the cake the Coffie and everything on the damn table."
1481,tt0463392,10088,9,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!
1482,tt0463392,10088,10,"I really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself, but please consider in taking up a different profession."
1483,tt0463392,10088,11,"I respect the fact that you completed a movie, but i have to ask you "" WERE YOU SMOKING CRACK "", I mean the makeup on your girls, the scary Zombies, what were you thinking."
1484,tt0463392,10088,12,"To the whole nation, if i could have voted Zero i would have."
1485,tt0463392,10088,13,WORST FILM IN MOVIE MAKING HISTORY!!!
1486,tt0463392,10089,1,German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible: he's unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.
1487,tt0463392,10089,2,Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium.
1488,tt0463392,10089,3,This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of EW.
1489,tt0463392,10089,4,"I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set."
1490,tt0463392,10089,5,The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.
1491,tt0463392,10089,6,The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies.
1492,tt0463392,10089,7,"Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face."
1493,tt0463392,10089,8,"The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent."
1494,tt0463392,10089,9,"Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA."
1495,tt0463392,10089,10,"Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse, and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment."
1496,tt0463392,10089,11,The sets are excruciatingly bad.
1497,tt0463392,10089,12,"The production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint ""Precinct 707"" on a cardboard wall."
1498,tt0463392,10089,13,"Since the actors were obviously unpaid non professionals a sad assortment of European emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands, bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middle aged women and since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms."
1499,tt0463392,10089,14,"Sadly, they couldn't afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental."
1500,tt0463392,10089,15,More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him.
1501,tt0463392,10089,16,One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies.
1502,tt0463392,10089,17,"The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated."
1503,tt0463392,10089,18,"The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her."
1504,tt0463392,10089,19,"Don't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride."
1505,tt0463392,10089,20,"After much prolonged hand clawing out of straw covered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance."
1506,tt0463392,10089,21,"They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make up generously airbrushed around their eyes."
1507,tt0463392,10089,22,"Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway."
1508,tt0463392,10089,23,"At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Euro trash techno into the soundtrack."
1509,tt0463392,10089,24,We're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise.
1510,tt0463392,10089,25,Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.
1511,tt0463392,10089,26,"Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified."
1512,tt0463392,10089,27,This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog.
1513,tt0463392,10089,28,"Yes, a golden shower it is."
1514,tt0463392,10089,29,I won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending.
1515,tt0463392,10089,30,All I can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece.
1516,tt0463392,10089,31,The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist.
1517,tt0463392,10090,1,This movie is a joke.
1518,tt0463392,10090,2,"I mean a ""ha ha"" funny joke."
1519,tt0463392,10090,3,Why.
1520,tt0463392,10090,4,"Because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh I got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical, inane plot and horrible acting."
1521,tt0463392,10090,5,Wow!
1522,tt0463392,10090,6,Within this movie there are so many unanswered questions... for example; why do these women become zombies and how.
1523,tt0463392,10090,7,"Why are there four black women who are zombie's ""caretakers"" and what is their purpose."
1524,tt0463392,10090,8,"Since when does 6 people make up a ""nation"" of Zombies."
1525,tt0463392,10090,9,"And is smeared black eye mascara ""scary"" to anyone, anywhere."
1526,tt0463392,10090,10,Even a 2 year old.
1527,tt0463392,10090,11,And lastly; Why was this movie made at all.
1528,tt0463392,10090,12,Why. why. why.
1529,tt0463392,10090,13,No answer.
1530,tt0463392,10090,14,That's what I thought.
1531,tt0463392,10090,15,"On the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie: We apologize for this movie in advance"" LOL."
1532,tt0463392,10090,16,At least they had the decency to do this much!
1533,tt0463392,10091,1,I cannot believe that this movie was ever created.
1534,tt0463392,10091,2,I think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse.
1535,tt0463392,10091,3,The zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup.
1536,tt0463392,10091,4,The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes.
1537,tt0463392,10091,5,"Finally, there are maybe five or six zombies total, definitely not a nation."
1538,tt0463392,10091,6,"The best part of the movie, if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished."
1539,tt0463392,10091,7,"Again to reiterate other user comments, the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie."
1540,tt0463392,10091,8,"Also, there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all."
1541,tt0463392,10091,9,It is never explained.
1542,tt0463392,10092,1,Seriously crappy movie.
1543,tt0463392,10092,2,"First off, the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse/furniture store."
1544,tt0463392,10092,3,"The ""bad"" cop takes a girl, which they had pulled over, into the warehouse's attic, while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there."
1545,tt0463392,10092,4,"The ""bad"" cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag, and the newbie cop doesn't think there are any problems, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets a bullshit response, and then he thinks everything is OK for now."
1546,tt0463392,10092,5,"The ""bad"" cop repeats this process, and even once with a tit scene made it slightly better."
1547,tt0463392,10092,6,"But eventually people start to catch on, which took awhile considering how fing obvious it was."
1548,tt0463392,10092,7,"One girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies, like ya do."
1549,tt0463392,10092,8,"Now, the ""bad"" cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch, and then he gets rid of the duffel bagged body."
1550,tt0463392,10092,9,"Since she had the oogey boogey magic put on her, she comes back with lots of eye shadow on, which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie... also, the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become ""eye shadow monsters""."
1551,tt0463392,10092,10,"Some of the girls meet up with a dude, who is apparently a currency specialist, and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently."
1552,tt0463392,10092,11,"But when the girls see other people, such as the one girls husband, he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out, but others don't even notice.... massive plot hole."
1553,tt0463392,10092,12,"So, to wrap it up, the eye shadow monsters kill the ""bad"" cop, who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene."
1554,tt0463392,10092,13,It was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel!
1555,tt0463392,10092,14,Like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping.
1556,tt0463392,10093,1,I cant believe blockbuster carries this movie.
1557,tt0463392,10093,2,It was SO BAD.
1558,tt0463392,10093,3,I was totally fooled by the box art.
1559,tt0463392,10093,4,DON'T BE FOOLED!!
1560,tt0463392,10093,5,Its not worth your time I promise you.
1561,tt0463392,10093,6,I don't know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what.
1562,tt0463392,10093,7,I am so disappointed. : The description on the back of the box doesn't even match!
1563,tt0463392,10093,8,The girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper.
1564,tt0463392,10093,9,The synopsis on the back says she is only 17.
1565,tt0463392,10093,10,Did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it!.
1566,tt0463392,10093,11,Those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be.
1567,tt0463392,10093,12,If anyone actually liked this flick then I've lost all faith in humanity.
1568,tt0463392,10093,13,And don't even get me started on the story compared to the title.
1569,tt0463392,10093,14,Or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations.
1570,tt0463392,10093,15,Or that the cops didn't even have close to real uniforms.
1571,tt0463392,10093,16,Why would i even say that..
1572,tt0463392,10093,17,Who cares about the cops uniforms!.
1573,tt0463392,10093,18,Compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on.
1574,tt0463392,10093,19,This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans.
1575,tt0463392,10094,1,Mt little sister and I are self proclaimed horror movie buffs.
1576,tt0463392,10094,2,"We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks."
1577,tt0463392,10094,3,"Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a lot of bad ones."
1578,tt0463392,10094,4,This BY FAR is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life.
1579,tt0463392,10094,5,"Not only was the acting horrible, but the special effects, graphics and ever ""zombie"" make up was the worst I have seen."
1580,tt0463392,10094,6,If you can even call it make up black eye shadow around the eyes This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it's cover.
1581,tt0463392,10094,7,Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about. do your selves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1582,tt0463392,10094,8,"I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying ""This movie sucks, don't waste your time, return NOW"" hahahhaa I don't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this POS movie!"
1583,tt0463392,10094,9,"i don't even know how it got the ratings that it did, t should be in the negative"
1584,tt0463392,10095,1,Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars.
1585,tt0463392,10095,2,There's a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn't spend 30 seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary.
1586,tt0463392,10095,3,This film is ... well ...
1587,tt0463392,10095,4,"I guess it's pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn / snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits apart from the acting, plot, story, sets, dialogue and sound."
1588,tt0463392,10095,5,I wrongly assumed it was about zombies.
1589,tt0463392,10095,6,Watching it is actually quite scary in fairness; you're terrified someone will come over and you'll never be able to describe what it is and they'll go away thinking you're a freak that watches home made amateur torture videos or something along those lines.
1590,tt0463392,10095,7,I'm so taken aback I'm writing this review on my mobile so I don't forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same horrible fate that I just suffered.
1591,tt0463392,10095,8,"I worst film I've ever seen and I can say with hand on heart it will never, never be topped."
1592,tt0463392,10096,1,This film has to be the worst I have ever seen.
1593,tt0463392,10096,2,The title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope.
1594,tt0463392,10096,3,"The story line of the film is laughable at best, with the acting so poor you just have to cringe."
1595,tt0463392,10096,4,The title 'Zombie Nation' implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total.
1596,tt0463392,10096,5,This cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy 80's music when the zombies 'attack'.
1597,tt0463392,10096,6,The zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a La Roux video.
1598,tt0463392,10096,7,"If you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so, then burn the copy."
1599,tt0463392,10097,1,I stopped by BB and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend.
1600,tt0463392,10097,2,"Now, I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the acting will be sub par, and the sets will be suspect."
1601,tt0463392,10097,3,So I'm not expecting much.
1602,tt0463392,10097,4,But it should at least have a story.
1603,tt0463392,10097,5,"Stories don't cost a thing except time.....apparently, they didn't have any time either."""
1604,tt0463392,10097,6,"Zombie Nation"" had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers."
1605,tt0463392,10097,7,The picture of the zombie on the front cover NEVER appears in the movie.
1606,tt0463392,10097,8,It was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre.
1607,tt0463392,10097,9,The running time is only 81 minutes but it felt like 2 hours.
1608,tt0463392,10097,10,"According to my wife who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room, it sounded like zombie porn....which if you think about, sounds kinda gross.....but it wasn't even that good."
1609,tt0463392,10097,11,The only suggestion I can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess.
1610,tt0463392,10097,12,It ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off.
1611,tt0463392,10097,13,I rated it a 1 out of 10 because IMDb won't allow me to use decimals.
1612,tt0463392,10098,1,Not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts.
1613,tt0463392,10098,2,Makeup that a child can do.
1614,tt0463392,10098,3,Acting was over done...poor directing.
1615,tt0463392,10098,4,Editing was very choppy...many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous.
1616,tt0463392,10098,5,Sound was badly dubbed.
1617,tt0463392,10098,6,Music was highly inappropriate.
1618,tt0463392,10098,7,Casting was extremely off...must have been on crack.
1619,tt0463392,10098,8,"Zombies that talk let alone...drive, dance, work...just pisses me off."
1620,tt0463392,10098,9,And the bad guy...
1621,tt0463392,10098,10,Holy Crap!
1622,tt0463392,10098,11,As horribly casted as he was...he was the best looking zombie of all.
1623,tt0463392,10098,12,Which doesn't say much.
1624,tt0463392,10098,13,The Cover Art was good but very deceiving...as was the Main Menu of the DVD...great artwork and music.
1625,tt0463392,10098,14,"DON""T BOTHER!"
1626,tt0463392,10099,1,Thank God!
1627,tt0463392,10099,2,I didn't waste my money renting it but i downloaded it!
1628,tt0463392,10099,3,"This happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life, fg visual effects, unnecessary gore and nudity!"
1629,tt0463392,10099,4,Far apart from other Zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others.
1630,tt0463392,10099,5,There are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie.
1631,tt0463392,10099,6,"OK if you get time after reading this comment, please check out the director'sUlli Lommel profile."
1632,tt0463392,10099,7,"After seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this, i mean every movie directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2."
1633,tt0463392,10099,8,"And now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him, but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence."
1634,tt0463392,10099,9,Even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.
1635,tt0463392,10100,1,"usually I support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant...i tend to support everybody, because their efforts are worth...but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits!"
1636,tt0463392,10100,2,"imagine the following situation:1. think about the REALLY WORST horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far.2. think about some great, attractive ART for that movie's DVD box...and a promising plot...3. voil√ !"
1637,tt0463392,10100,3,you got ZOMBIE NATION.see it only if you really don't have anything else better to do.
1638,tt0463392,10100,4,ANYTHING is better.
1639,tt0463392,10101,1,Notice I have given this 1 star if the option been given I would have given this zero.
1640,tt0463392,10101,2,As I put this DVD into my TV and sat down on my couch I was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest.
1641,tt0463392,10101,3,I looked this movie up on IMDb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so I guess I came into it critical of every mistake.
1642,tt0463392,10101,4,But it didn't prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen.
1643,tt0463392,10101,5,The box makes this movie out to look ¬Öwell OK at best.
1644,tt0463392,10101,6,DO NOT LET THAT FOOL YOU.
1645,tt0463392,10101,7,This movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world.
1646,tt0463392,10101,8,The best way I can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it.
1647,tt0463392,10101,9,"The acting if you can call it that, the ""plot"" so many holes must look like Swiss cheese, and the special effects really are just terrible."
1648,tt0463392,10101,10,Please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch.
1649,tt0463392,10101,11,"In the end I'm not saying I can make a better movie than this, but I am thinking it."
1650,tt0463392,10102,1,If ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it's this pile of crap.
1651,tt0463392,10102,2,I love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity.
1652,tt0463392,10102,3,"I actually began to feel angry watching this film because it's so insultingly poor, I can't believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable."
1653,tt0463392,10102,4,There's no plot and the non plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking.
1654,tt0463392,10102,5,"The people don't react, act or in any way resemble human beings."
1655,tt0463392,10102,6,The entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be.
1656,tt0463392,10102,7,"The whole thing is one pointless mess, it doesn't go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and don't do very much."
1657,tt0463392,10102,8,"I could make a better film than this, so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before."
1658,tt0463392,10102,9,It's pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time.
1659,tt0463392,10102,10,"Honestly, the very worst movie of all time."
1660,tt0463392,10102,11,You'll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 10/10 and urge you to BUY the DVD.
1661,tt0463392,10102,12,"I can't imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film, it's terrible.0/10 and that's generous."
1662,tt0463392,10103,1,This movie had me going.
1663,tt0463392,10103,2,The title was perhaps the greatest idea that I heard.
1664,tt0463392,10103,3,"I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the US and a group of lone survivors, band together, and plan to take out the zombies."
1665,tt0463392,10103,4,DEAD WRONG!
1666,tt0463392,10103,5,It's about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what's coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge.
1667,tt0463392,10103,6,As you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved.
1668,tt0463392,10103,7,Where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation.
1669,tt0463392,10103,8,"First off, the zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face."
1670,tt0463392,10103,9,"What are zombies but mindless, debatable intelligent, cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs."
1671,tt0463392,10103,10,"These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models, they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies."
1672,tt0463392,10103,11,"Sure the eating and killing is there, but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement."
1673,tt0463392,10103,12,"Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, it makes fun of that genre and asks the question, ""why can't zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines."""
1674,tt0463392,10103,13,I would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies.
1675,tt0463392,10103,14,"I would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much, it's an insult and as for scary¬Önot even."
1676,tt0463392,10104,1,I only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was a total piece of crap.
1677,tt0463392,10104,2,The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie.
1678,tt0463392,10104,3,"No, it was a hundred times WORSE."
1679,tt0463392,10104,4,Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that's not true; the idiot who directed this junk is the WORST director ever.
1680,tt0463392,10104,5,The American cop has a German accent!
1681,tt0463392,10104,6,"The ""police station"" was a desk in a warehouse with a sign ""Police Station"" hanging on the wall."
1682,tt0463392,10104,7,"There is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about TEN FEET.This cop pulls women over, cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse."
1683,tt0463392,10104,8,He tells his cop partner to wait in the car.
1684,tt0463392,10104,9,Then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag.
1685,tt0463392,10104,10,"The cop partner thinks maybe something is not right, that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women, but he isn't sure if that is what's happening because he's a moron!"
1686,tt0463392,10104,11,"The dialog is totally stupid, the acting is awful, and the characters act in the stupidest manner I have ever seen on screen."
1687,tt0463392,10104,12,"It is totally obvious to the cop's partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it, and yet, the partner, who is there all along, doesn't know what is happening!"
1688,tt0463392,10104,13,The director of this film is a total hack.
1689,tt0463392,10104,14,I stopped the movie at 30 minutes because I couldn't take it anymore.
1690,tt0463392,10104,15,It has to be one of the WORST movies I have ever started to watch and I won't waste anymore time on it writing this review.
1691,tt0463392,10104,16,Absolutely WORTHLESS.
1692,tt0463392,10105,1,"Zombie Nation 2004 RHey, I was bored."
1693,tt0463392,10105,2,I looked in my Comcastic little box to find a movie to watch.
1694,tt0463392,10105,3,Zombie Nation.
1695,tt0463392,10105,4,"Hey, I love zombie movies."
1696,tt0463392,10105,5,Says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description.
1697,tt0463392,10105,6,Funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film.
1698,tt0463392,10105,7,I could've used that advice.
1699,tt0463392,10105,8,Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 in that it's completely misnamed.
1700,tt0463392,10105,9,"It has little if anything, depending on your point of view to do with zombies, and takes place all within one city."
1701,tt0463392,10105,10,"This film revolves around a crooked cop, who acts as badly as possible he has to be trying to suck this much, while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them."
1702,tt0463392,10105,11,"Yup, he's a serial killer cop."
1703,tt0463392,10105,12,"Not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick, it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong."
1704,tt0463392,10105,13,"Serial killers enjoy killing, they live for it and they get down and personal with it."
1705,tt0463392,10105,14,"This guy knocks out the women, and injects them with some poison."
1706,tt0463392,10105,15,He doesn't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it.
1707,tt0463392,10105,16,Talk about boring!
1708,tt0463392,10105,17,"Eventually, one of the whopping five women he kills has Voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy."
1709,tt0463392,10105,18,"They were all buried or tossed into the ocean, but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing."
1710,tt0463392,10105,19,The women then act very poorly and take their revenge.
1711,tt0463392,10105,20,Oh yay.
1712,tt0463392,10105,21,This film was crap in every category.
1713,tt0463392,10105,22,"Crap acting, crap writing, crappier sets, and crappier make up effects."
1714,tt0463392,10105,23,"The women don't look zombie like, unless you count really dark make up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie."
1715,tt0463392,10105,24,"They can all talk, behave, think, and act perfectly human."
1716,tt0463392,10105,25,The gore is weak compared to even many PG 13 films and the nudity is beyond brief.
1717,tt0463392,10105,26,You see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence...
1718,tt0463392,10105,27,Then the exact same breasts later!
1719,tt0463392,10105,28,Go figure.
1720,tt0463392,10105,29,Guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite.
1721,tt0463392,10105,30,The police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in.
1722,tt0463392,10105,31,"You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set up and even, unless you are blind, you can see the director failing."
1723,tt0463392,10105,32,"Steer clear, it's a waste of time.1/10"
1724,tt0463392,10106,1,"Yeah, I'm sure it really could be a nation . . . if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times."
1725,tt0463392,10106,2,"Man, I am REALLY glad that I saw this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it."
1726,tt0463392,10106,3,"I'm a big fan of the George Romero movies and I'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie, he'd probably throw up while laughing too hard."
1727,tt0463392,10106,4,"I mean, what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like Charlie's Devils."
1728,tt0463392,10106,5,"It really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer, especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop/police station/apartment/flat/whatever room it was with the gong in the background, and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop."
1729,tt0463392,10106,6,"I couldn't even tell what nationality the killer was, and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn't help either."
1730,tt0463392,10106,7,"Oh well, what can I expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world."
1731,tt0463392,10106,8,"So, for all of those who worship Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you just like reaming on bad C movies C for Craptastic, then this is the movie for you . . . or not."
1732,tt0463392,10107,1,"Last weekend I bought this 'zombie movie' from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of ""Land of the Dead""."
1733,tt0463392,10107,2,"Boy, was I wrong."
1734,tt0463392,10107,3,"It seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover art, which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre."
1735,tt0463392,10107,4,We watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell phone.
1736,tt0463392,10107,5,"They actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him; but once they started driving the car, I couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore."
1737,tt0463392,10107,6,"Some people actually consider this a ""so bad, it's good"" movie, they are liars."
1738,tt0463392,10107,7,"I didn't finish the movie, but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie, which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through."
1739,tt0463392,10107,8,"This is even worse than ""Zombiez"" DO NOT WATCH!"
1740,tt0463392,10108,1,German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible: he's unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.
1741,tt0463392,10108,2,Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium.
1742,tt0463392,10108,3,This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of EW.
1743,tt0463392,10108,4,"I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set."
1744,tt0463392,10108,5,The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.
1745,tt0463392,10108,6,The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies.
1746,tt0463392,10108,7,"Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face."
1747,tt0463392,10108,8,"The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent."
1748,tt0463392,10108,9,"Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA."
1749,tt0463392,10108,10,"Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse, and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment."
1750,tt0463392,10108,11,The sets are excruciatingly bad.
1751,tt0463392,10108,12,"The production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint ""Precinct 707"" on a cardboard wall."
1752,tt0463392,10108,13,"Since the actors were obviously unpaid non professionals a sad assortment of European emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands, bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middle aged women and since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms."
1753,tt0463392,10108,14,"Sadly, they couldn't afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental."
1754,tt0463392,10108,15,More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him.
1755,tt0463392,10108,16,One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies.
1756,tt0463392,10108,17,"The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated."
1757,tt0463392,10108,18,"The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her."
1758,tt0463392,10108,19,"Don't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride."
1759,tt0463392,10108,20,"After much prolonged hand clawing out of straw covered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance."
1760,tt0463392,10108,21,"They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make up generously airbrushed around their eyes."
1761,tt0463392,10108,22,"Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway."
1762,tt0463392,10108,23,"At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Euro trash techno into the soundtrack."
1763,tt0463392,10108,24,We're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise.
1764,tt0463392,10108,25,Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.
1765,tt0463392,10108,26,"Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified."
1766,tt0463392,10108,27,This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog.
1767,tt0463392,10108,28,"Yes, a golden shower it is."
1768,tt0463392,10108,29,I won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending.
1769,tt0463392,10108,30,All I can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece.
1770,tt0463392,10108,31,The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist.
1771,tt0463392,10109,1,"BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is, he loves his crap."
1772,tt0463392,10109,2,I've never seen a Ulli Lommel film but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful.
1773,tt0463392,10109,3,Like the movies I said in the beginning don't even equal a six when added together!
1774,tt0463392,10109,4,After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is.
1775,tt0463392,10109,5,He is the worst out there.
1776,tt0463392,10109,6,The credits wouldn't end as the pathetic movie started and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in.
1777,tt0463392,10109,7,The acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots.
1778,tt0463392,10109,8,The editing is easily the worst.
1779,tt0463392,10109,9,This movie made no sense and I unbearably couldn't take it anymore as it wouldn't end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie.
1780,tt0463392,10109,10,I couldn't take it anymore.
1781,tt0463392,10109,11,I wasted 45 minutes of my life.
1782,tt0463392,10109,12,DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP!
1783,tt0463392,10110,1,This movie was by far the worst movie that I have ever seen in my entire life.
1784,tt0463392,10110,2,I'm not even kidding.
1785,tt0463392,10110,3,It was poorly made and the actors couldn't act.
1786,tt0463392,10110,4,It was a waste of my time and money.
1787,tt0463392,10110,5,It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have put together on our own.
1788,tt0463392,10110,6,The case the movie came in is definitely a disguise.
1789,tt0463392,10110,7,Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case.
1790,tt0463392,10110,8,It appears that the director or make up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie.
1791,tt0463392,10110,9,The credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie.
1792,tt0463392,10110,10,Which watching the credits was the best part of the movie.
1793,tt0463392,10110,11,This was honestly an awful movie and I couldn't believe how badly it was put together.
1794,tt0463392,10110,12,"Scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like ""whats going on."""
1795,tt0463392,10110,13,The audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen's joking around making a fake fight scene.
1796,tt0463392,10110,14,IF you are considering renting or buying this movie I would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show's how awful it truly is.
1797,tt0463392,10110,15,I wish i would have watched it before i rented it.
1798,tt0463392,10111,1,"Horrible acting, Bad story line, cheesy makeup, and this is just the tip of the iceberg."
1799,tt0463392,10111,2,"I have never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes in I decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen..."
1800,tt0463392,10111,3,It didn't.
1801,tt0463392,10111,4,"Aside from a nice breast shot The movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse, and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the sets."
1802,tt0463392,10111,5,"You even see this same red chair in several different ""locations"" If you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment, not some warehouse which will echo all your actor's dialog.."
1803,tt0463392,10111,6,"Note to producers Renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse, and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable If you spend your money to rent this people I hope you got it with a return guarantee..."
1804,tt0463392,10111,7,You will be demanding your money back...
1805,tt0463392,10111,8,I only spent $2.99 to rent this tonight and I feel ripped off.
1806,tt0463392,10112,1,"Every year I watch hundreds of films, including many low budget amateurish straight to DVD abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see."
1807,tt0463392,10112,2,"I have seen thousands of films in my time, many excellent, many forgettable."
1808,tt0463392,10112,3,Zombie Nation I will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable 'horror' films I have ever seen ¬ñ in fact I still haven't recovered from the experience of watching it.
1809,tt0463392,10112,4,"The day after, it seems like some kind of weird dream."
1810,tt0463392,10112,5,Did I really see what I thought I saw.
1811,tt0463392,10112,6,Why do the police work out of a warehouse.
1812,tt0463392,10112,7,Did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers.
1813,tt0463392,10112,8,Is it safe.
1814,tt0463392,10112,9,Is it safe.
1815,tt0463392,10112,10,Is it safe.
1816,tt0463392,10112,11,"I wouldn't recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a 'good' film, and neither would I recommend it as 'so bad its good'."
1817,tt0463392,10112,12,"However, if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever ¬ñ this is for you."
1818,tt0463392,10112,13,"Now, whenever anyone asks me what the worst film I have ever seen is, I will say Zombie Nation."
1819,tt0463392,10112,14,"Seriously ¬ñ I think it's a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude."
1820,tt0463392,10112,15,"He really is the Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age, and I for one can't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one."
1821,tt0463392,10113,1,"i've discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging. the zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you get to the movie and it's women with raccoon masks on. zero special effects...and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet. the funny thing is that Lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie. the only thing i can think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a ""cult classic""...however, i can't possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made. the real horror in this film is how bad it is. i'm embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another Lommel film again!"
1822,tt0463392,10114,1,This is one of the worst films ever.
1823,tt0463392,10114,2,I like cheesy movies but this is simply awful.
1824,tt0463392,10114,3,Where are the images in the film that are on the box.
1825,tt0463392,10114,4,I think more money was spent on the DVD box illustrations than on the entire film.
1826,tt0463392,10114,5,Why would a company release a DVD that the cover is so misleading.
1827,tt0463392,10114,6,I feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box.
1828,tt0463392,10114,7,As much as I explore IMDb I should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store.
1829,tt0463392,10114,8,I have no one to blame except myself.
1830,tt0463392,10114,9,I want my money and time back.
1831,tt0463392,10114,10,DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.
1832,tt0463392,10114,11,"Even if curiosity is motivating you, stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead."
1833,tt0463392,10114,12,It will be much more enjoyable.
1834,tt0463392,10114,13,You have been warned!
1835,tt0463392,10115,1,I have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film.
1836,tt0463392,10115,2,I even got the rental company to give me my money back because I argued that they perpetrated false advertising.
1837,tt0463392,10115,3,"It's not enough that the movie itself is a p.o.s., but the cover art is what sold me."
1838,tt0463392,10115,4,I've done better make up effects on my children at Halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art.
1839,tt0463392,10115,5,"Can you say ""raccoon eyes."""
1840,tt0463392,10115,6,"I'm not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details, but come on, the movie's main character is an L.A. cop who was born and raised in Alabama but has a German accent!.!"
1841,tt0463392,10115,7,It's beyond insulting.
1842,tt0463392,10116,1,I honestly want the last 30 minuets of my life back.
1843,tt0463392,10116,2,The only person that is fit to watch this movie is Helen Keller I kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get better.
1844,tt0463392,10116,3,Then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on there eyes.
1845,tt0463392,10116,4,They talked like regular people.
1846,tt0463392,10116,5,One drove a car.
1847,tt0463392,10116,6,"Some voodoo woman asked what one of the ""Zombies"" wanted and the "" zombie"" said I want to Dance THAT WAS IT Out came the movie I couldn't take it any longer Can I sue for a ¬Ω hour of my life....."
1848,tt0463392,10117,1,Wow.
1849,tt0463392,10117,2,I went to the video store tonight because I was in the mood for a bad B Horror movie and I found this Gem.
1850,tt0463392,10117,3,I looked at the cover and I thought it looked like just the movie for my mood.
1851,tt0463392,10117,4,I brought it home and put it on.
1852,tt0463392,10117,5,This movie was not the B Horror movie that I had in mind.
1853,tt0463392,10117,6,This was MUCH worse.
1854,tt0463392,10117,7,"I wanted a bad movie but what I got, I didn't know that crap like this existed amongst man."
1855,tt0463392,10117,8,This movie seemed like a 5 year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it.
1856,tt0463392,10117,9,I am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies.
1857,tt0463392,10117,10,He needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs.
1858,tt0463392,10117,11,If you are thinking about renting this or buying it.
1859,tt0463392,10117,12,I will tell you the same thing that I would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide.
1860,tt0463392,10117,13,"""DON'T DO IT, IT'S NOT WORTH IT!"""
1861,tt0463392,10117,14,I really have nothing nice to say about this movie.
1862,tt0463392,10117,15,DON'T DO IT!
1863,tt0472047,2860,1,This movie only got a 1 because you can't give a zero!
1864,tt0472047,2860,2,if you have a weak tummy AT ALL don't watch. animal rights people you don't want to watch either. it makes people vegetarians i swear i witnessed it happen!
1865,tt0472047,2860,3,the only cool parts are the case and the fact that its a true story. its really really super creepy that this guy worked at ADT while he killed people!
1866,tt0472047,2860,4,still feel safe when you punch in that little code. i don't!
1867,tt0472047,2860,5,He had access to every code in Kansas!!!!!!
1868,tt0472047,2860,6,I hated the movie it was not scary it was mentally scaring!
1869,tt0472047,2860,7,Do your self a favor and don;t rent/buy this movie i think it cost about $20 to make that INCLUDES their OVER paid actors!!!!
1870,tt0472047,2861,1,I can not believe I wasted my money to rent this movie.
1871,tt0472047,2861,2,I thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better.
1872,tt0472047,2861,3,"The acting, the music drowning out the actors."
1873,tt0472047,2861,4,Horrible.
1874,tt0472047,2861,5,Save your money!
1875,tt0472047,2861,6,You have to read the movie all the way through b\c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines.
1876,tt0472047,2861,7,I never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered.
1877,tt0472047,2861,8,"What did that have to do with the ""real"" BTK killer."
1878,tt0472047,2861,9,I understand why there were no famous actors\actresses in this movie.
1879,tt0472047,2861,10,The script would have turned me away within the first page of reading.
1880,tt0472047,2861,11,You would be better off watching paint dry.
1881,tt0472047,2862,1,Somebody needs to send this Uli Lommel guy back to MOVIE SCHOOL.
1882,tt0472047,2862,2,Who ever told him HE knew HOW to make a movie.
1883,tt0472047,2862,3,Can just ANYBODY make movies these days.
1884,tt0472047,2862,4,"In the past, it always REQUIRED TALENT before someone could make a movie."
1885,tt0472047,2862,5,"After watching this lame BTK movie and the others he's made, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as I DO."
1886,tt0472047,2862,6,Actually I think even I could make better movies than Uli LAME ALL.
1887,tt0472047,2862,7,"This movie has absolutely NOTHING to do with the BTK Killer, other than the names of the victims and the killer."
1888,tt0472047,2862,8,THAT'S IT.
1889,tt0472047,2862,9,Where did this guy get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other preposterous crap that's in the movie.
1890,tt0472047,2862,10,"This is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term ""BTK"" because of the fame it has achieved."
1891,tt0472047,2862,11,Absolutely pitiful.
1892,tt0472047,2862,12,"The only serial killer movie I would consider WORSE is that lame ""DAHMER"" movie."
1893,tt0472047,2862,13,That kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me nauseous.
1894,tt0472047,2862,14,Whoever made that one needs to be shot.
1895,tt0472047,2863,1,I was glad to watch this movie free of charge as I am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library.
1896,tt0472047,2863,2,"Nothing against low budget movies, but this movie has horrible acting and directing."
1897,tt0472047,2863,3,How can a movie as this one ever be made.
1898,tt0472047,2863,4,"The director should be blacklisted, and for all the poor actors, it is for sure not a jumping board into a career."
1899,tt0472047,2863,5,"Please make sure that you'll not watch this movie, the acting is lame, the camera and directing awful."
1900,tt0472047,2863,6,"There are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the ""LOW 10""."
1901,tt0472047,2863,7,"Another example would be ""Dracula 3000""."
1902,tt0472047,2863,8,"People who make money with this movie should give it to charity, so at least it serves for a good reason."
1903,tt0472047,2863,9,In this case I would watch it even another 10 or at least one more time.
1904,tt0472047,2864,1,This film is so bad it simply defies reality.
1905,tt0472047,2864,2,"The filming is grade school material at best, the acting is pathetic and the director should forever be banished from film making in any form."
1906,tt0472047,2864,3,So bad it can't even be watched as comedy such something along the lines of Showgirls.
1907,tt0472047,2864,4,The ONLY thing this DVD had going for it was the cover art.
1908,tt0472047,2864,5,All I can write to those of you who haven't had the misfortune to witness this is to please do yourself a well deserved favor in advance and don't waste your time or your money on this piece of garbage.
1909,tt0472047,2864,6,"If you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects, there are many other more worthy in such a realm than this trash."
1910,tt0472047,2865,1,Generally I don't do minus's and if this site could i would give this movie 3 out of 10 meaning I really hated this movie.
1911,tt0472047,2865,2,I thought Uwe Boll's alone in the dark was the worst i've seen yet but at least i gave it a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinionStephen Dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit.
1912,tt0472047,2865,3,"Hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win a Oscar for best movie if they were competing."
1913,tt0472047,2865,4,"Now to the plot, this movie is about the BTK killer which is fine but they've could have done better."
1914,tt0472047,2865,5,The start looked OK but that's it I had to fast forward most of it because the death's where boring.
1915,tt0472047,2865,6,I like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths.
1916,tt0472047,2865,7,I'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this.
1917,tt0472047,2865,8,"Sorry for rambling but there's nothing good to say about it, because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this.. this.. thing of disaster."
1918,tt0472047,2865,9,Uwe Boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake.
1919,tt0472047,2865,10,Well sorry i couldn't explain the plotif there was one but that was the best i could.
1920,tt0472047,2865,11,Now if you don't mind i'm going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life....
1921,tt0472047,2865,12,OK not for life
1922,tt0472047,2866,1,No words can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the BTK killer.
1923,tt0472047,2866,2,Rating this film one out of ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a film.
1924,tt0472047,2866,3,"From start to finish, there was not one single highlight."
1925,tt0472047,2866,4,"The entire thing was horrendously put together; the script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few."
1926,tt0472047,2866,5,"A number of scenes are literally laugh out loud funny, for the atrocious way in which the entire thing is put together."
1927,tt0472047,2866,6,"This review may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a low budget film, but this is not the case."
1928,tt0472047,2866,7,Just thinking about the movie I have just seen makes my blood start to boil.
1929,tt0472047,2866,8,How this film was ever granted rights for production i will NEVER know.
1930,tt0472047,2866,9,"I am almost tempted to actually recommend BTK, because it is truly a stand out in regards to how pathetic, and disturbingly awful it is."
1931,tt0472047,2866,10,"I can honestly say, in all my years of film going, this is the WORST."
1932,tt0472047,2866,11,MOVIE.
1933,tt0472047,2866,12,EVER.
1934,tt0472047,2866,13,"I wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage, and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand, had I known what I was in for."
1935,tt0472047,2866,14,ZERO out of TEN.
1936,tt0472047,2867,1,"I was lying on my bed, with a really bad cold or flu or whatever."
1937,tt0472047,2867,2,I figure maybe I'd kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago.
1938,tt0472047,2867,3,I wish I never picked this movie!
1939,tt0472047,2867,4,After I watched it I felt even more sick and I wanted to throw up.
1940,tt0472047,2867,5,Afterwordswhen I got better of course I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that the Dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one.
1941,tt0472047,2867,6,I hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do don't eat or you'll feel the way I felt after I first watched it.
1942,tt0472047,2867,7,I think you would have a better time watching The Santa Claus 3.
1943,tt0472047,2867,8,At least that movie had better reviews on this site.
1944,tt0472047,2868,1,This is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK killer.
1945,tt0472047,2868,2,The events in this movie are not even close to the truth.
1946,tt0472047,2868,3,Why they couldn't make a movie of the real events doesn't make any sense since the real events are more interesting then this made up farce.
1947,tt0472047,2868,4,Don't even waste your time watching this for free.
1948,tt0472047,2868,5,"Low budget and a shameful depiction of the events which should not be made a joke of, which is really what this movie did."
1949,tt0472047,2868,6,If they would allow me to give a 10 to this movie I would.
1950,tt0472047,2868,7,The acting sucked and it looks like it was shot on an old VHS video camera from the 80s.
1951,tt0472047,2868,8,Save your time and money by not watching this movie.
1952,tt0472047,2869,1,"Story goes like this, Netflix was late sending me my dvds so I went on down to the the analog rental place known as ""Blockbuster Video"" They suck you know."
1953,tt0472047,2869,2,"Real bad, They have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your viewing pleasure yet I never want to see any of those."
1954,tt0472047,2869,3,"So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf, all by its lonesome self."
1955,tt0472047,2869,4,I like seeing films based on serial killers.
1956,tt0472047,2869,5,"Its just a part of humanity that I will never understand, therefore I wanna see that kind of stuff."
1957,tt0472047,2869,6,"Anyways I put this DVD in and all the sudden from the very first second, it sucks."
1958,tt0472047,2869,7,"I'm sitting there with my b.f. and we are like, ""what is this kind of crap."""
1959,tt0472047,2869,8,"Unsteady camera operation, horrible acting, the first scene in which a woman gets killed you wonder if she would rather just calmly gab instead, Then a rat gets stuffed down her throat."
1960,tt0472047,2869,9,I really wonder if the director has a hard on for this crap.
1961,tt0472047,2869,10,"There is nothing decent about this ""film""."
1962,tt0472047,2869,11,"All I have to say to the director is ""do you own a freakin' tripod."""
1963,tt0472047,2869,12,Every shot was brutally unstable.
1964,tt0472047,2869,13,The music was awful.
1965,tt0472047,2869,14,It was like they just decided one day to make a movie.
1966,tt0472047,2869,15,"They were probably gathering people from WalMart to show up and ""act"" for them."
1967,tt0472047,2869,16,Just plain awful.
1968,tt0472047,2869,17,If you make a movie like this then directing is your hobby NOT what you should be doing for a living SHould not make it to the DVD renal outlets for movie buffs like myself.
1969,tt0472047,2869,18,Better left at home for your friends when you are having a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them with....
1970,tt0472047,2869,19,"Then you break out your BTK KIller film and say, ""Wanna see this crappy movie I did once."""
1971,tt0472047,2870,1,Oh My God!
1972,tt0472047,2870,2,"Please, for the love of all that is holy, Do Not Watch This Movie!"
1973,tt0472047,2870,3,It it 82 minutes of my life I will never get back.
1974,tt0472047,2870,4,"Sure, I could have stopped watching half way through."
1975,tt0472047,2870,5,But I thought it might get better.
1976,tt0472047,2870,6,It Didn't.
1977,tt0472047,2870,7,Anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual.
1978,tt0472047,2870,8,No wonder us Australians/New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies.
1979,tt0472047,2870,9,"Everything about this movie is horrible, from the acting to the editing."
1980,tt0472047,2870,10,"I don't even normally write reviews on here, but in this case I'll make an exception."
1981,tt0472047,2870,11,I only wish someone had of warned me before I hired this catastrophe
1982,tt0472047,2871,1,I rented this horrible movie.
1983,tt0472047,2871,2,The worst think I have ever seen.
1984,tt0472047,2871,3,I believe a 1st grade class could have done a better job.
1985,tt0472047,2871,4,The worse film I have ever seen and I have seen some bad ones.
1986,tt0472047,2871,5,Nothing scary except I paid 1.50 to rent it and that was 1.49 too much.
1987,tt0472047,2871,6,"The acting is horrible, the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of trash."
1988,tt0472047,2871,7,The slauther house scenes are so low budget that it makes a B movied look like an Oscar candidate.
1989,tt0472047,2871,8,All I can say is if you wnat to waste a good evening and a little money go rent this horrible flick.
1990,tt0472047,2871,9,I would rather watch killer clowns from outer space while sitting in a bucket of razors than sit through this flop again
1991,tt0472047,2872,1,This is by far the worst horror/thriller I've seen in my 29 years.
1992,tt0472047,2872,2,If someone offers this to you for free tell them NO.
1993,tt0472047,2872,3,This movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it.
1994,tt0472047,2872,4,"The plot isn't even the worst part of this movie.....its the acting, camera work, lighting, and sound. there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. whoever paid to have this film made is broke now."
1995,tt0472047,2872,5,I hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie.
1996,tt0472047,2872,6,In its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual BTK killer's capture but I've seen movie of the weeks that looked like Oscar winners compared to this.
1997,tt0472047,2873,1,This movie features a gorgeous brunette named Danielle Petty.
1998,tt0472047,2873,2,"She has stunning green eyes, and is in the first few scenes and the last scene."
1999,tt0472047,2873,3,She is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive.
2000,tt0472047,2873,4,"She may not have a future as an actress, because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers."
2001,tt0472047,2873,5,The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it.
2002,tt0472047,2873,6,"It is not a good horror film, or a good fake journalistic report, or remotely well done."
2003,tt0472047,2873,7,There is no skill apparent in it's production.
2004,tt0472047,2873,8,It is like a bad student film.
2005,tt0472047,2873,9,"The story's horrific elements do not make you sick, it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick."
2006,tt0472047,2873,10,I would give this movie ZERO stars if I could.
2007,tt0472047,2874,1,This movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured.
2008,tt0472047,2874,2,"There's male full frontal nudity, dead animal parts, dogs licking nipples, the female loosing control of her bladder."
2009,tt0472047,2874,3,All shot in a gray cold color.
2010,tt0472047,2874,4,"Effective, but a little too much."
2011,tt0472047,2874,5,We then move on to seeing the BTK killer's youth as well as the present and his history of crimes.
2012,tt0472047,2874,6,The tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and it's creepy.
2013,tt0472047,2874,7,"Here we don't see fancy or good imagery, it looks as if shot with your home camera."
2014,tt0472047,2874,8,"It doesn't look horrifying, but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling."
2015,tt0472047,2874,9,"What this movie doesn't have is any drama, really."
2016,tt0472047,2874,10,"There are some cop scenes every once in a while, but there's no excitement in terms of them finding the killer."
2017,tt0472047,2874,11,There isn't much of an arc to this story.
2018,tt0472047,2874,12,"This could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness."
2019,tt0472047,2874,13,"Unfortunately, the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage."
2020,tt0472047,2874,14,It's dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again.
2021,tt0472047,2874,15,Sometimes you don't know it's coming and don't have enough time to look away.
2022,tt0472047,2874,16,And that I have to reject.
2023,tt0472047,2874,17,I'm all for low budget horror movies but I don't tolerate animal suffering.
2024,tt0472047,2874,18,"It was unnecessary, excessive, and comes without warning."
2025,tt0472047,2874,19,"I'm glad that Lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does, but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore."
2026,tt0472047,2874,20,Stay away from this garbage.
2027,tt0472047,2875,1,This is the biggest piece of crap ever.
2028,tt0472047,2875,2,"It looks like they spent more time, effort, and money making the DVD cover than they did on the actual movie."
2029,tt0472047,2875,3,I really thought the DVD had been switched out with someone's homemade porno until I recognized one of the actors from the cover.
2030,tt0472047,2875,4,This movie looks like someone made it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and they spent half of that on rats.
2031,tt0472047,2875,5,"The picture is really clear, but that, along with the very unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you can call it that, production, acting, if that is actually what they are doing, and script, if they had one, makes this movie look worse than an old porno."
2032,tt0472047,2875,6,At least the old porno has a point.
2033,tt0472047,2875,7,"This just looks like some PETA members got together and decided to make a really disturbing, pointless PSA about animals rights and feelings."
2034,tt0472047,2875,8,This is so not worth the money or the time.
2035,tt0472047,2875,9,It has nothing in common with the actual BTK serial killer other than the name of the killer and that of some of the victims.
2036,tt0472047,2875,10,"The people who made this movie should be glad he's not still free, or he might have come after them just for screwing up this movie so bad."
2037,tt0472047,2876,1,I question the motive of the creators of this fictional account of the BTK killer's motives.
2038,tt0472047,2876,2,Are they attempting to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters.
2039,tt0472047,2876,3,Who is responsible for this.
2040,tt0472047,2876,4,Don't they think the people involved with this monster are hurting enough.
2041,tt0472047,2876,5,What a blatant disrespect and exploitation of the victims!
2042,tt0472047,2876,6,"It was like a personality experiment: What disturbs you more, the slaughterhouse or the human murders."
2043,tt0472047,2876,7,"They used actual names of some of the victims....this movie was hideous, disrespectful and insulting!"
2044,tt0472047,2876,8,The creators of this movie used this tragedy for their own agenda!
2045,tt0472047,2876,9,People need to awaken and redraw the line!
2046,tt0472047,2877,1,My mother worked with Dennis L.
2047,tt0472047,2877,2,"Raider for eleven years, not to mention shared an office with him."
2048,tt0472047,2877,3,"When it was announced he was BTK, she was shocked."
2049,tt0472047,2877,4,The whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the Wichita Killer.
2050,tt0472047,2877,5,I've heard her re tell them many times.
2051,tt0472047,2877,6,"I've inquired her about a lot of things, and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to."
2052,tt0472047,2877,7,"I've read the entire book written about Raider, Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas."
2053,tt0472047,2877,8,"There was another BTK movie on TV not too long ago, and I thought this one would have been better at portraying Dennis' killings, maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motives."
2054,tt0472047,2877,9,I'm going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie.
2055,tt0472047,2877,10,"This is based on my mom's portrayal of him, all my readings on him, and the video tapes I've seen of him talking."
2056,tt0472047,2877,11,"First of all, the camera angles were horrible."
2057,tt0472047,2877,12,It looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera.
2058,tt0472047,2877,13,The acting was terrible and I couldn't even bear to watch it.
2059,tt0472047,2877,14,Dennis Raider never had long hair.
2060,tt0472047,2877,15,"Dennis Raider was a ""very anal man"" and was a ""follow the rule book"" kind of guy."
2061,tt0472047,2877,16,"He wasn't as nice as the movie made him look, he was very polite and abrupt, business like."
2062,tt0472047,2877,17,"Same goes for his killings, as far as we all know."
2063,tt0472047,2877,18,"If you've seen his confession in court, you can already guess."
2064,tt0472047,2877,19,And as for the obsession with the slaughter house.
2065,tt0472047,2877,20,No.
2066,tt0472047,2877,21,Never have I read or has Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs.
2067,tt0472047,2877,22,"In fact, he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods."
2068,tt0472047,2877,23,Yet through out the whole movie he was putting animals in his victim's faces and acting like he cared about the well being of them.
2069,tt0472047,2877,24,"Dennis Raider never killed the people that he knew, he confessed this, but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also."
2070,tt0472047,2877,25,"I really don't even want to go in to this movie, and I'm already ranting."
2071,tt0472047,2877,26,This is NOT what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of BTK.
2072,tt0472047,2877,27,This is NOT what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie.
2073,tt0472047,2877,28,"If you want a badly shot half porno with some slaughter scenes served the side, then this is your kind of movie."
2074,tt0472047,2878,1,Don't see this movie.
2075,tt0472047,2878,2,Bad acting and stupid gore effects.
2076,tt0472047,2878,3,A complete waste of time.
2077,tt0472047,2878,4,"I was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and hot chicks,instead the director depended on animal slaughter videos to shock you, the watcher."
2078,tt0472047,2878,5,Disgusting.
2079,tt0472047,2878,6,"The murders are pretty lame, basically strangulation."
2080,tt0472047,2878,7,"One woman he stuffs worms in her mouth, one he puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her."
2081,tt0472047,2878,8,"BTK = BTK broiler, burger king's ""killer"" new sandwich....ha ha."
2082,tt0472047,2878,9,I don't think this movie relied too much on actual facts.
2083,tt0472047,2878,10,"I mean, he real BTK killer didn't carry around a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms..and oh yeah...a slaughtered cow head too."
2084,tt0472047,2878,11,Go figure.
2085,tt0472047,2879,1,This was the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies.
2086,tt0472047,2879,2,First of I'm from Kansas this movie does not have a shred of truth in it at all.
2087,tt0472047,2879,3,Its like they took BTK name and made up the rest.
2088,tt0472047,2879,4,On top of that it looks like someone was like I've only got $20 bucks here take it and make a movie and oh yeah don't worry about researching btk at all just make up something. seriously pure dookie no one should ever see this movie.
2089,tt0472047,2879,5,The slaughtering cows scenes and making his victims eat stuff and describing animal slaughter BTK did none of these things but the movie does so for the love of god never see this god awful movie.
2090,tt0472047,2879,6,The made for TV ones are way better and way more accurate
2091,tt0472047,2880,1,I have never watched a movie in so little time.
2092,tt0472047,2880,2,The only salvation was the fast forward function on the DVD unit.
2093,tt0472047,2880,3,It was like watching a poorly produced CBC film.
2094,tt0472047,2880,4,"There was obviously no money for lighting, filming, sets, location, scriptwriters, editors, actors..."
2095,tt0472047,2880,5,"Oh, there was absolutely no story either!"
2096,tt0472047,2880,6,I need to write ten lines of comment...
2097,tt0472047,2880,7,"Bad, awful, horrible, wretched, anguishing, tortuous, bilious, nauseous, sickening, fromage, disgusting, flimsy, icky, yucky, pukey, stinky, smelly, vile, putrid, all thumbs down, and I don't know if I can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap o matic production was!"
2098,tt0472047,2881,1,This movie was so ridiculous i never even finished watching it i actually thought someone had made their own version and dubbed it onto the DVD from the movie store.
2099,tt0472047,2881,2,"This movie made me sick not because it was gory, but because i wasted 2 50 on it!!!!"
2100,tt0472047,2881,3,It looks like my brother and i went into a house and made the movie ourselves and edited slaughterhouse footage into it!
2101,tt0472047,2881,4,"I am so ticked off, even The BTK Killer deserves more credit than that it was not even accurate i mean come on the cow head was obviously made out of play dough or BUBBLE GUM OMG I cant even get all the words out to explain it DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!"
2102,tt0472047,2882,1,"This movie is the biggest steaming pile of you know what, Being from and growing up in Wichita Kansas;I know for a fact 90% of the movie was Bogus."
2103,tt0472047,2882,2,"Aside from the names of some of the victims, nothing else much was correct."
2104,tt0472047,2882,3,"The movie looks like it was made with dad's handy cam, It had footage that I believe came from another film along with stock footage from a slaughter house."
2105,tt0472047,2882,4,"I usually enjoy watching bad films for the fun of it, but due to the bad acting, poorly prepared or non existent sets and a very dull and short ending."
2106,tt0472047,2882,5,It was a struggle to watch it through to the ending.
2107,tt0472047,2882,6,I recommend that you not waste your money on this film or you will be sorry.
2108,tt0472047,2882,7,Crunch
2109,tt0472047,2883,1,This movie is just so awful.
2110,tt0472047,2883,2,So bad that I can't bear to expend anything other than just a few words.
2111,tt0472047,2883,3,"Avoid this movie at all costs, it is terrible."
2112,tt0472047,2883,4,None of the details of the crimes are re enacted correctly.
2113,tt0472047,2883,5,Lots of slaughterhouse footage.
2114,tt0472047,2883,6,Weird cuts and edits.
2115,tt0472047,2883,7,No continuity to the plot.
2116,tt0472047,2883,8,The acting is absolutely the most amateur I have ever seen.
2117,tt0472047,2883,9,This bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of it's content.
2118,tt0472047,2883,10,The camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky.
2119,tt0472047,2883,11,It looks as if it was shot on video.
2120,tt0472047,2883,12,"In fact, now that they've got Dennis Rader with life in prison, I wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as well."
2121,tt0472047,2883,13,"Seriously, don't even think about watching this one."
2122,tt0472047,2883,14,I'd give it a negative star if I could.
2123,tt0472047,2884,1,"As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen, and warn my friends and co workers of it."
2124,tt0472047,2884,2,"Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K."
2125,tt0472047,2884,3,"Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever, then he'd watch it."
2126,tt0472047,2884,4,I lost.
2127,tt0472047,2884,5,"I believe that even I made better videos than this in high school, and those were hardly great feats of a young genius."
2128,tt0472047,2884,6,"This film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder, although it is surprisingly clear, but also in acting wooden, hollow, and pathetic don't scratch the surface, as well as just generally bad movie feeling."
2129,tt0472047,2884,7,"I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash, suddenly, I was reminded of some bad high school plays I know that I reference high school too often here, but this film did seem very juvenile both in terms of the set, which seemed far too fake, but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script, not entirely sure what was actually going on."
2130,tt0472047,2884,8,"My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't describe how utterly horrid the time I spent watching this was."
2131,tt0472047,2884,9,It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie.
2132,tt0472047,2885,1,"I can't really say what I think about this movie, its against the guidelines, I've watched many many films, and this has got to be the worst one yet, Extremely low budget, I'm guessing all the money went into the slaughter house scenes, cause I could of did a better job with a b&w 8mm camera and a crew of monkeys."
2133,tt0472047,2885,2,"It was so bad I registered just to leave a comment, cause I had to tell someone, movie rental place wasn't enough."
2134,tt0472047,2885,3,"But this is my 2 cents worth, I suggest borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself."
2135,tt0472047,2885,4,Cause i sure wouldn't waste the money on it myself again.
2136,tt0472047,2885,5,Now i leave you with this comment.
2137,tt0472047,2885,6,I hope your not made at the rental place when they wont refund you your money ..
2138,tt0472047,2885,7,=
2139,tt0472047,2886,1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie."
2140,tt0472047,2886,2,Its like a low budget made for TV Canadian movie.
2141,tt0472047,2886,3,Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen and there have been many others out there.
2142,tt0472047,2886,4,This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD player or VCR. :~ .
2143,tt0472047,2886,5,Is it possible to write ten lines.
2144,tt0472047,2886,6,The acting was horrific.
2145,tt0472047,2886,7,It had absolutely no flow.
2146,tt0472047,2886,8,I saw the made for TV movie on the BTK killer and it was much betterin comparison to this one.
2147,tt0472047,2886,9,I am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the BTK killer they missed by a mile.
2148,tt0472047,2886,10,It appeared to be more of a infomercial for animal rights.
2149,tt0472047,2887,1,"I just watched this movie today and not only is it, terrible and awful but it looks like the director just got a few friends together to make a movie about a sick man."
2150,tt0472047,2887,2,I also think that this movie has the look of a porn video with it's clear crisp just filmed view.
2151,tt0472047,2887,3,Thank heavens I work in a video store and I didn't have to pay for it cause this movie is crap x infinity..
2152,tt0472047,2887,4,DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE!!!!!
2153,tt0472047,2887,5,You'd have a better time watching Dude Where's My Car than this piece of crap!
2154,tt0472047,2887,6,And that's not saying a lot for that movie either.
2155,tt0472047,2887,7,The acting is lousy and the movie is just very unwatchable.
2156,tt0472047,2887,8,I was watching this movie and I wanted to kill myself during and after the movie.
2157,tt0472047,2887,9,"I walked home and threw up after watching this piece of dirt movie, I then took a shower and burnt my clothes."
2158,tt0472047,2887,10,"If I had half a mind I would of took the movie outside and burned it too cause no one should be subjected to it...well maybe members of Al Queda..especially the ones we have in custody and also child rapists who are in prison on life sentences with out parole....just make a set up like a clock work Orange, And then force these cheese head to watch it over and over again."
2159,tt0472047,2888,1,"To compare this squalor with an old, low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old, low budget porno flick."
2160,tt0472047,2888,2,The animal scenes have no meaning nor do they represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions.
2161,tt0472047,2888,3,"The synopsis on the back of the DVD case says in part, ""¬Ögripping retelling of the BTK Killer's reign of terror."""
2162,tt0472047,2888,4,This is NOT a retelling.
2163,tt0472047,2888,5,A retelling would suggest that you are being told the truth of what happened or how or why.
2164,tt0472047,2888,6,None of these things are true.
2165,tt0472047,2888,7,"I'm an enthusiastic studier of serial killers and have seen some pretty crappy movies about them and honestly, this IS NOT one of them."
2166,tt0472047,2888,8,This isn't even about the BTK killer.
2167,tt0472047,2888,9,Save yourself some time and a few bucks and rent Dahmer instead.
2168,tt0472047,2888,10,THAT serial killer movie is accurate and true.
2169,tt0472047,2888,11,"However, if you just HAVE to see this movie for yourself, check it out for free at your local library and even then, you'll still feel cheated."
2170,tt0472047,2889,1,The case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price.
2171,tt0472047,2889,2,"I expected a ""Based on the true story"" movie only to find a shot on home video hodge podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non related slaughter house scenes."
2172,tt0472047,2889,3,The video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects.
2173,tt0472047,2889,4,"I started this review before I was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but, low and behold it only got worse."
2174,tt0472047,2889,5,If I could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten.
2175,tt0472047,2889,6,Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one.
2176,tt0888019,8216,1,"And maybe, as Fred Sandford used to say, ""one across the lips""."
2177,tt0888019,8216,2,That to those who released this film on an unsuspecting public.
2178,tt0888019,8216,3,"And perhaps to the person in ""Rue Morgue"" who called this a ""Fender Hellbender"" and said it was good."
2179,tt0888019,8216,4,"Five young girls, apparently taking a short cut home from a high school football game, become lost and stop to ask directions at some small store in the middle of nowhere."
2180,tt0888019,8216,5,"While there the driver accidentally hits a parked SUV & knocks out a headlight, but the girls all decide to just leave & not go find the driver."
2181,tt0888019,8216,6,"But the driver does come to find them, and it's not just that the headlight on her vehicle got dinged, it's for another reason that the girls do not yet understand."
2182,tt0888019,8216,7,"When the driver does first catch them she yes, it's a she brandishes a shot gun & makes them strip down, and keeps screaming at them, ""how much did you see.""."
2183,tt0888019,8216,8,Of course the girls are scared to death & don't know what she's talking about.
2184,tt0888019,8216,9,"As the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the driver of the SUV, who manages to inflict all manner of injuries on the girls, who are remarkably resilient to shot gun blasts and screwdrivers where they didn't want them."
2185,tt0888019,8216,10,Eventually they come to find that something happened back at that store after they left that is the reason for this woman's psychotic rage.
2186,tt0888019,8216,11,And eventually they have a chance at revenge and take it about as far as they can go.
2187,tt0888019,8216,12,"There are elements of this film that are rather disturbing and scary, but unfortunately, those moments are undermined by bad acting, bad dialog, and huge lapses of credibility."
2188,tt0888019,8216,13,"One girl is hit by a shot gun blast and appears to be mortally wounded, and she's feeling cold, her life is passing before her eyes, but she got better."
2189,tt0888019,8216,14,And how far can a mini van run on an almost empty gas tank at speeds of 80 miles per hour.
2190,tt0888019,8216,15,"I need one of those things, it apparently gets GREAT mileage."
2191,tt0888019,8216,16,"There should have been an ending when the girls got their revenge, but the film goes on for a bit after that, which is an anti climax, but they at least learn some of what set the woman off, and the driver is still worried about ""messing up her mom's van"", which is obviously the least of anyone's worries."
2192,tt0888019,8216,17,"So this isn't the worst film I've seen, but it's too amateur to be good and yet a bit too scary and gruesome at times to be completely terrible."
2193,tt0888019,8216,18,But it does take the cake for plenty of shrill hysterics and you'll want to put two across your ears if you watch this.
2194,tt0888019,8216,19,"Which, by the way, I don't necessarily recommend. 4 out of 10."
2195,tt0888019,8217,1,"Five Across the Eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew, they stop off at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide to just drive off & leave it."
2196,tt0888019,8217,2,"Soon after the other car forces them to stop & a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out & shouts at them, makes them take their clothes off & makes them pee on them & then randomly drives off."
2197,tt0888019,8217,3,Shaken & shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost & are low on gas...
2198,tt0888019,8217,4,"Produced & directed by Greg Swinson & Ryan Theissen with Swinson writing the thing & Theissen responsible for the cinematography & editing I have to say that Five Across the Eyes is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen if not the worst, I mean I'm struggling to think of a film I have seen that's worse."
2199,tt0888019,8217,5,"Now let me start off by saying that I am sure a lot of the film making decision taken here were deliberate to try & provoke atmosphere, tension, realism & suspense but there is not one aspect of Five Across the Eyes that I didn't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on YouTube & even then it's still slightly embarrassing & a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that I could have been doing something more entertaining & fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers."
2200,tt0888019,8217,6,"The reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the IMDb the amount of 1 Star comments is revealing & they can't all be wrong, right. & it's message board which I think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it's absolutely trashed by just about everyone & the phrase 'the worst film I have ever seen' is used a few times & to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things & I have to agree with them."
2201,tt0888019,8217,7,"The story is terrible, alright I suspect it's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal."
2202,tt0888019,8217,8,There's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen & it just feels totally random.
2203,tt0888019,8217,9,"It goes on for ages, the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature."
2204,tt0888019,8217,10,The dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who don't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff & screaming a lot.
2205,tt0888019,8217,11,"Oh god the screaming, there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates & annoys & prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly."
2206,tt0888019,8217,12,"Then there's the real killer, the entire film is set & shot within the confines of a mini van, seriously the camera never leaves this car & as you can imagine it gets really boring, add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen & Five Across the Eyes is a film that I hated with a passion."
2207,tt0888019,8217,13,On a technical level again I can see that the film making style here was a deliberate choice but I have to be honest again & say Five Across the Eyes is the worst looking film I have ever seen.
2208,tt0888019,8217,14,As a fan of film I like my films to look like proper films as it's a visual medium & I definitely don't want them to look worse than the average YouTube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while I was drunk.
2209,tt0888019,8217,15,"It really does look that amateurish & that bad, it's a complete eyesore & I hated every moment of every second of it."
2210,tt0888019,8217,16,Just think The Blair Witch Project 1999 only ten times worse looking & sounding & you will be almost there.
2211,tt0888019,8217,17,There are times during Five Across the Eyes when you literally can't tell what's going on or happening because of the camera work & the almost pitch black & grainy contrast levels.
2212,tt0888019,8217,18,The violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood & a stabbing at the end.
2213,tt0888019,8217,19,"Low budget doesn't even begin to describe Five Across the Eyes, with a supposed budget of about $4,000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release."
2214,tt0888019,8217,20,"The two vans in the film were owned by members of the production & that's basically pretty much the entire budget right there, the locations."
2215,tt0888019,8217,21,"The acting is pretty bad by the main cast, I just hated all the fake put on crying & screaming that didn't convince at all but did irritate immensely."
2216,tt0888019,8217,22,"Five Across the Eyes will go down as one of the worst films I have ever seen & I have seen a few films, whenever anyone now ask's me what's the worst film I have ever seen Five Across the Eyes will definitely get a mention."
2217,tt0888019,8217,23,"I hated it, every single aspect & wretched moment of it."
2218,tt0888019,8218,1,"I never finished this movie for a reason, it was dreadful and thats just the acting."
2219,tt0888019,8218,2,I wasn't even sure what the film was about tbh it didn't make a lot of sense and the violence was awful.
2220,tt0888019,8218,3,I mean ususally i like some nude in a film lol but it was just sick because of what was happening.
2221,tt0888019,8218,4,ALL the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities.
2222,tt0888019,8218,5,This is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone or even consider it.
2223,tt0888019,8218,6,N
2224,tt0888019,8219,1,"Im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when I'm picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it,it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish!"
2225,tt0888019,8219,2,"i think i could of done better myself. i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul."
2226,tt0888019,8220,1,Less than 10 minutes into this film I wanted it to end as it was painful.
2227,tt0888019,8220,2,"All this ""horror"" movie was about was a group of whiny bitches doing stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming."
2228,tt0888019,8220,3,Do not let the positive reviews fool you as this really is a terrible movie and you really shouldn't watch it.
2229,tt0888019,8220,4,"The movies plot had potential to be something great, but it just doesn't happen."
2230,tt0888019,8220,5,"A group of five ""teenage"" girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them."
2231,tt0888019,8220,6,"Two minutes into the movie, and the characters are already arguing and this doesn't stop."
2232,tt0888019,8220,7,"All we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining, crying, screaming, ""acting"" and arguing."
2233,tt0888019,8220,8,"None of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too, so you don't get to really know these characters or enjoy them."
2234,tt0888019,8220,9,The acting was terrible and I was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers.
2235,tt0888019,8220,10,"None of these women looked a day under 20, and one of them easily looked like she was nearly 30 years old."
2236,tt0888019,8220,11,At least get people who look the age.
2237,tt0888019,8220,12,"None of them gave even remotely decent performances, and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities."
2238,tt0888019,8220,13,"The ""actress"" who played the killer overdone it, but she at least showed something that the other girls didn't a little bit of talent."
2239,tt0888019,8220,14,"The characters don't help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny, stupid bitches."
2240,tt0888019,8220,15,"That is all I can really say about them, and it did not help that they ALL survived."
2241,tt0888019,8220,16,"If I have to go into detail, in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot."
2242,tt0888019,8220,17,One girl injures herself and is whining about it...four of them aren't wearing seat belts...what do you expect.
2243,tt0888019,8220,18,"One of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer...and you all just happen to be conveniently ""too hurt"" to help."
2244,tt0888019,8220,19,Whatever.
2245,tt0888019,8220,20,The filming of the movie is absolutely terrible.
2246,tt0888019,8220,21,"I don't care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut, the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie."
2247,tt0888019,8220,22,"The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera blurred out, shook and brushed up against an ""actress"" was horrendous."
2248,tt0888019,8220,23,"It was also grainy, and at times you couldn't hear what characters were saying not that it was anything worth listening to."
2249,tt0888019,8220,24,"Supposedly the killers car in the movie that supposedly got hit, even though we only heard the accident is actually the directors car in real life."
2250,tt0888019,8220,25,No wonder they didn't show the car getting hit!
2251,tt0888019,8220,26,"This movie is so cheap, they can't even show a car getting a little scratched up."
2252,tt0888019,8220,27,"Oh, gotta mention the soundtrack also...if that's what it was."
2253,tt0888019,8220,28,"It was horrid...sad one second, then hard rock the next."
2254,tt0888019,8220,29,"At the end of the day, Five Across The Eyes just feels like a terrible home movie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes."
2255,tt0888019,8220,30,"It doesn't help when the script is terrible, the scares/tension/suspense and hardly even any gore to make up for it are absent, the acting is terrible and the picture quality and filming are horrendous."
2256,tt0888019,8220,31,This was a horrible low budget movie.
2257,tt0888019,8220,32,Avoid it at all costs.1/10
2258,tt0888019,8221,1,"This ""film"" attempts to follow the genre of low budget, hand held camera flicks that have proved to be very effective and successful."
2259,tt0888019,8221,2,"This one, fails, and HOW.It's amazing how many so called ""awards"" this piece of garbage has got plastered on the cover..... it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they actually submitted this...."
2260,tt0888019,8221,3,Words fail to describe just how absolutely appalling this movie really is.
2261,tt0888019,8221,4,"Seriously, it's THAT BAD.I watched it in 20 minutes flat, on almost continual fast forward."
2262,tt0888019,8221,5,"From rubbish lighting to dreadful directing, grainy visuals to muffled sound, and of course not forgetting the ABYSMAL acting, this was one completely and utterly pathetic piece of so called film making."
2263,tt0888019,8221,6,"It seriously, has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever."
2264,tt0888019,8221,7,"Save your cash and watch a decent low budget horror flick, there are plenty out there Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, to name but a few."
2265,tt0888019,8221,8,AVOID this rubbish at all costs.
2266,tt0888019,8221,9,DO NOT waste your money or time on this piece of trash pretending to be an actual film.
2267,tt0888019,8221,10,Take heed of all the other comments!
2268,tt0888019,8221,11,You've been warned!
2269,tt0888019,8222,1,Um...
2270,tt0888019,8222,2,"Okay, I guess I get the whole shaky cam, gorilla style filming technique but unfortunately I think a gorilla could have made a better movie..."
2271,tt0888019,8222,3,This thing was just a complete mess from the get go.
2272,tt0888019,8222,4,"Bad acting, bad directing, bad story and horrific cinematography."
2273,tt0888019,8222,5,"How this piece of garbage was released I will never know, but it has and unfortunately I watched it."
2274,tt0888019,8222,6,"Filmed on location in Tennessee by the directing team of Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen Harry and Lloyd, ""Five Across The Eyes"" I'm assuming is supposed to resemble a ""Blair Witch"" type film but falls short..."
2275,tt0888019,8222,7,Okay it nose dives off a cliff.
2276,tt0888019,8222,8,"I was actually embarrassed for these young women, whom I'm sure were promised Hollywood stardom, but ended up in this dung heap."
2277,tt0888019,8222,9,"The dialog is ridiculous, and actually aggravates you as you listen to it."
2278,tt0888019,8222,10,"How this is supposed to be a horror flick is another mystery, as there is nothing even remotely scary about it, except for the fact that I watched it..."
2279,tt0888019,8222,11,"Try this one on for size: There is 5 of you and 1 of her, do the math and beat her ass..."
2280,tt0888019,8222,12,"""The End""."
2281,tt0888019,8222,13,Saddly it went on and on for 95 more minutes of mind numbing stupidity...
2282,tt0888019,8222,14,"I saw it for free, and wanted my money back."
2283,tt0888019,8223,1,"Definitely, definitely the worst film I've ever seen, no questions asked!"
2284,tt0888019,8223,2,"Contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others, since it's an independent, low budget film, but c'mon already ¬ñ the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying."
2285,tt0888019,8223,3,"Agreeing with everything that has been said about this film, for example the mind numbingly weak acting when it's this bad you take another go at shooting the scene, god damn it, the thing I found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script, assuming such a thing existed during the production."
2286,tt0888019,8223,4,"There was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers, the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath ¬ñ gang up on her, why don't you."
2287,tt0888019,8223,5,"The only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it which is, as the rest of the film, a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully."
2288,tt0888019,8223,6,"¬Öoh and by the way, this movie is NOTHING like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand held camera ¬ñ this is an effect and not a trait!"
2289,tt0888019,8223,7,"Used cleverly it can be breathtaking, but in this case it's an excuse for inadequate cinematography."
2290,tt0888019,8224,1,"Watching this Movie. l thought to myself, what a lot of garbage."
2291,tt0888019,8224,2,These girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it.
2292,tt0888019,8224,3,"Waste of time watching it, faint heavens l only hired it."
2293,tt0888019,8224,4,The acting was below standard and story was unbearable.
2294,tt0888019,8224,5,"Anyone contemplating watching this film, please save your money."
2295,tt0888019,8224,6,"The film has no credit at all. l am a real film buff and this is worse than ""Attack of the Green Tomatoes"".l only hope that this piece of trash didn't cost too much to make."
2296,tt0888019,8224,7,Money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world. l only hope there isn't a sequel in the pipeline.
2297,tt0888019,8225,1,DO NOT WATCH THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A FILM.
2298,tt0888019,8225,2,I have wasted time and money on this and am pretty psed off about it.
2299,tt0888019,8225,3,The acting is comparable with high school plays.
2300,tt0888019,8225,4,The script is shocking.
2301,tt0888019,8225,5,There is no plot.
2302,tt0888019,8225,6,"Twenty minutes from the end which I believe I should be rewarded for reaching I had a headache from all the screaming, crying and wailing the five girls make."
2303,tt0888019,8225,7,"The majority of the violence is rare for a film nowadays suggested rather than graphically depicted but I found the characters so damn irritating that I wanted to see them, and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of st, die in the most horrible ways possible."
2304,tt0888019,8225,8,I spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor 100 minutes of yours.
2305,tt0888019,8225,9,Don't do it.
2306,tt0888019,8226,1,"Given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings, the girls in this film would be collecting Gold, Silver and Bronze at a Darwin Awards Olympic ceremony."
2307,tt0888019,8226,2,"A mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did, and would have screamed a lot less while doing so."
2308,tt0888019,8226,3,"If you like films with a grainy picture, deliberately amateur camera work my 92 year old grandmother wields a camcorder with better results, extremely poor sound and no discernible plot/narrative, then this is your ideal film."
2309,tt0888019,8226,4,"Also note that you should enjoy the following: women screaming for no reason, women whining for no reason."
2310,tt0888019,8226,5,In fact reason and logic don't appear much in this film.
2311,tt0888019,8226,6,"For example: ""we have to find Stephanie"" ""yeah I can't believe I was speaking to her, like, last night"" ""she called you last night."" ""yeah, she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one"" ""WHAT."
2312,tt0888019,8226,7,"How come she didn't tell me""."
2313,tt0888019,8226,8,"As in, our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but I have a problem with the fact that she didn't tell me she was going on a date."
2314,tt0888019,8226,9,"Okay, so the budget is low."
2315,tt0888019,8226,10,That doesn't mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget.
2316,tt0888019,8226,11,The 'score' is interesting since all with the exception of one tracks have been written and performed by the writers/directors of the film itself.
2317,tt0888019,8226,12,"In fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by The Duskfall, a death metal band from Sweden."
2318,tt0888019,8226,13,The most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel.
2319,tt0888019,8227,1,I'll keep this fast and sweet.
2320,tt0888019,8227,2,Five girls on their way home from a football game decide to take a 'short cut' that leads them down a deserted forest ridden road.
2321,tt0888019,8227,3,"Of course nothing but good things happen to them, and they safely arrive at their destination."
2322,tt0888019,8227,4,"Alright, they don't."
2323,tt0888019,8227,5,"Soon they're hunted down by a deranged chick who has some severe mental issues, and what ensues is 90 minutes of sheer boredom."
2324,tt0888019,8227,6,I hope to never see any of these actors in any movie ever again.
2325,tt0888019,8227,7,"Their screaming, screeching voices gave me a headache, and the script was so poorly written that it included a lot of repeat phrases and nonsensical hysterical screaming."
2326,tt0888019,8227,8,"All in all, one of the worst cheap horror flicks I've ever seen...and I've seen a lot."
2327,tt0888019,8228,1,The problem with this movie is that it is shot on the worst possible camera and the film is blurry and grainy.
2328,tt0888019,8228,2,Maybe it's just the fact that whoever was holding the camera couldn't hold still because they were having a seizure or something.
2329,tt0888019,8228,3,There is also way too much poop and vomit in this movie.
2330,tt0888019,8228,4,There is someone vomiting every twenty minutes and it makes me think that this was made by some bulimic or something.
2331,tt0888019,8228,5,It was disgusting.
2332,tt0888019,8228,6,Then there is the annoying high pitched screaming that goes on and on and on and doesn't stop until the credits roll.
2333,tt0888019,8228,7,I also didn't like when all her friends were being shot or not I don't knowand she goes in the van and puts band aids on.
2334,tt0888019,8228,8,That was just really really stupid to even have that in a movie.
2335,tt0888019,8228,9,How much gas can a person siphon to get a van going.
2336,tt0888019,8228,10,It must be a whole lot because they don't run out of gas for the rest of the movie.
2337,tt0888019,8228,11,It was a terrible movie and I would highly suggest not ever seeing it in your whole entire life.
2338,tt0888019,8229,1,"Contains miner spoilers I have seen a number of decent Indie horror films such as The Hamiltons, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; unfortunately I felt Five Across the Eyes does not fall into this category."
2339,tt0888019,8229,2,"From start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting resonating from a very poor script, god only knows why the writers thought dialogue such as ""No don't go out there; don't go out there she'll get you: if she gets you she'll kill you and if she kills you you're dead"" is of movie quality."
2340,tt0888019,8229,3,This film displays very little character development and to be honest I couldn't care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redeeming qualities'.
2341,tt0888019,8229,4,All they do is cry and whinge throughout the entire movie and if the girls aren't crying their arguing; when they do converse the topics are completely random: about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently cremated appropriate subjects when you're being chased by a psychotic killer.
2342,tt0888019,8229,5,The soundtrack is also abysmal exhibiting corny techno music during both the start and end credits although hearing the credit music knowing the end was nearing seemed like heaven.
2343,tt0888019,8229,6,The camera work is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable.
2344,tt0888019,8229,7,I'm guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which resides in the girls' car almost the entire movie.
2345,tt0888019,8229,8,I think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible: to feel and experience what the girls are going through.
2346,tt0888019,8229,9,"But due to a very shaky camera, grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic."
2347,tt0888019,8229,10,It's one thing to make a film subjective but it's another to have action on the screen that an audience can't decipher because of the poor cinematography.
2348,tt0888019,8229,11,I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality.
2349,tt0888019,8229,12,"There are no redeeming factors to this film: bad acting, poor scripting, shoddy camera work and no story."
2350,tt0888019,8229,13,In light off all this I decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed; wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief.
2351,tt0888019,8229,14,"Its 94 minutes off stupid college girls crying, arguing, aimlessly running and having random inappropriate conversations."
2352,tt0888019,8229,15,"However, how many times do you get to see girls defecating into their hands and throwing the crap onto the windscreen of a chasing car."
2353,tt0888019,8230,1,I'm dumbfounded.
2354,tt0888019,8230,2,Yes that's right.
2355,tt0888019,8230,3,I'm really caught here.
2356,tt0888019,8230,4,"No way did I find it awful, but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency."
2357,tt0888019,8230,5,"The idea behind such a trim, minimal low budget Indie production isn't bad, but it's a confused muddle and in the end didn't do anything for me."
2358,tt0888019,8230,6,It's amateurish and simple; it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that of late fashionably rapid filming style.
2359,tt0888019,8230,7,"We have the documentary laced hand held camera moving everywhere despite never leaving the van, and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out."
2360,tt0888019,8230,8,"Lately you kind of get use to it, but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating."
2361,tt0888019,8230,9,Keeping it still will help.
2362,tt0888019,8230,10,The context has little groundwork which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads.
2363,tt0888019,8230,11,At a road side store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied SUV headlight.
2364,tt0888019,8230,12,"Scared, they flee and not too long that one light SUV appears behind them."
2365,tt0888019,8230,13,"Soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror spending most of the time playing out a drawn out, noisy and relentless cat and mouse game."
2366,tt0888019,8230,14,As for being disturbing¬Ö I guess that depends.
2367,tt0888019,8230,15,"Some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain, desperation and demented brutality with good use of piercing sound FX that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects, but also I found myself snickering too."
2368,tt0888019,8230,16,"In passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush, but hardly believable."
2369,tt0888019,8230,17,"The injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe, despite obviously they should be."
2370,tt0888019,8230,18,"Watch how blood runs freely, but it's not entirely convincing and can get dull."
2371,tt0888019,8230,19,The constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive.
2372,tt0888019,8230,20,"We get screaming, spewing, bleeding, running, cursing, body fluids and so on."
2373,tt0888019,8230,21,Quite unpleasant details followed too.
2374,tt0888019,8230,22,"With little really to do, it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up."
2375,tt0888019,8230,23,"Too many cringe moments arose from it, and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in."
2376,tt0888019,8230,24,"It was about set pieces, waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough."
2377,tt0888019,8230,25,Helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern.
2378,tt0888019,8230,26,"The performances; Jennifer Barnett, Angela Brunda, Danielle Lilley, Sandra Paduch and Mia Yi are workman like with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the script's weaknesses in its character foundation ."
2379,tt0888019,8230,27,"Veronica Garcia's flipped out, bug eyed intensity as the loony driver of the SUV was something¬Ö yeah something."
2380,tt0888019,8230,28,Her character's real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually non existent.
2381,tt0888019,8230,29,I guess being psychotic was good enough.
2382,tt0888019,8230,30,Now probably the most unnerving thing I came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack.
2383,tt0888019,8230,31,"Terrible techno music, to cheesy hard rock and an overwrought closing score."
2384,tt0888019,8230,32,"It never felt overdone or got in the way, but it did stick out like a sore thumb."
2385,tt0888019,8230,33,"Co directors Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources, but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle."
2386,tt0888019,8230,34,"Maybe it was enjoyable to make, but watching it just wasn't the case."
2387,tt0888019,8231,1,MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS...
2388,tt0888019,8231,2,BUT DOUBT IT CAN ACTUALLY BE SPOILT!!.
2389,tt0888019,8231,3,Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word....
2390,tt0888019,8231,4,Amateurish.
2391,tt0888019,8231,5,"This film tries it's best to be different from most films by the 'Blair Witch' type of filming....it doesn't work....it just ends up looking and feeling like somebody had a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie."
2392,tt0888019,8231,6,"The story has no explanation, the protagonist is given no real motivation and looks like a lesbian wearing a power suit compared to the five girls and there is no violence to speak of...just the sounds of screaming and crunching."
2393,tt0888019,8231,7,The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question.
2394,tt0888019,8231,8,"The five girls really do their best with what they've been given but on the whole come across as pretty terrible actresses...although with the material given it's hard to judge if they can actually aCt....they spend THE WHOLE movie screaming, squealing and whimpering....so much that half the time it's hard to make out what was said and the cameras are so bad it's actually hard to tell who said it."
2395,tt0888019,8231,9,This video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact just five girls in a van screaming in terror...that literally sums up the whole movie.....we then get to the end after what seems like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive... with one minus a finger.
2396,tt0888019,8231,10,The only thumbs upget it...finger....
2397,tt0888019,8231,11,LOL is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voicesand their pride after making this terrible movie.
2398,tt0888019,8231,12,Do not judge this by the poster....you'll be very let down.
2399,tt0888019,8232,1,"Five across the eyes ain't worth one off the wrist, I must admit at one point i was really worried, for about 30 seconds nobody made a noise and i thought my speakers had blown or that i had gone deaf with the constant screaming and high pitch yelling, me and the speakers are OK now thanks for asking, funnily enough that was the best bit of the film."
2400,tt0888019,8232,2,"I won't waste your time telling you the plot, read the other comments for that."
2401,tt0888019,8232,3,"If you have bought this DVD but not yet unwrapped it Don't, take it back and demand your money back, i've wasted mine don't do the same."
2402,tt0888019,8232,4,"I was actually shouting at the telly "" they're over here in the car, look for the camera lights, and get the camera man first "", i have left the swear words out but you can guess where they go."
2403,tt0888019,8232,5,If anybody would like to buy this film it's really good it's yours for a ten quid.
2404,tt0888019,8233,1,"This was probably the worst movie ever, seriously."
2405,tt0888019,8233,2,"I could actually do better myself, it wasn't even set up properly."
2406,tt0888019,8233,3,It's like this movie had a $5 budget and left with change.
2407,tt0888019,8233,4,Don't watch it.
2408,tt0888019,8233,5,"I didn't even get all the way through this movie, had to turn it off."
2409,tt0888019,8233,6,"I've give this a 1/10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie, but actually turned into a really bad comedy."
2410,tt0888019,8233,7,"Basically, a bunch of girls crashed into a car, broke a headlight, and the owner of that car went after them."
2411,tt0888019,8233,8,"The bit that i saw was a women with a gun telling a load of girls to take all their clothes off, what the hell. it must be some kind of cheesy porn movie as well."
2412,tt0888019,8234,1,The writers and producers of this little outing have plummeted new depths of depravity.
2413,tt0888019,8234,2,"Did writer's block set in so badly, OR had ideas dried up so much, that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman defecates in the back seat of a van, and then promptly throws the excrement at the car behind mind you at least this summarises what this film is worth."
2414,tt0888019,8234,3,"We had already been treated to one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint, as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once would have sufficed... we got the message!"
2415,tt0888019,8234,4,This really is taking toilet humour to another level!
2416,tt0888019,8234,5,Had the script and acting been better then I could have easily forgotten that I was watching a film shot entirely on low budget video.
2417,tt0888019,8234,6,"This was a fairly original storyline, with a clever the only piece of direction in that we only ever got to take the viewpoint from inside of the van; thus making it feel much more real."
2418,tt0888019,8234,7,"We never got to see inside any other locations, such as the store or the field where several of the women disappeared, and this could have added much needed tension."
2419,tt0888019,8234,8,The script was dire.
2420,tt0888019,8234,9,Lines like: 'I don't feel too good...
2421,tt0888019,8234,10,"I want to go home' after one of the girls has been pursued by a psychopath; subjected to rape by a screwdriver and shot at, seem a little undercooked."
2422,tt0888019,8234,11,The acting was diabolical apart from the maniac.
2423,tt0888019,8234,12,Did all the main 5 actresses in this learn acting by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike!
2424,tt0888019,8234,13,The sound was so bad that I had to watch the entire film with the subtitles on.
2425,tt0888019,8234,14,The director seemed to have an easy job in this.
2426,tt0888019,8234,15,It seems that the only direction he must have given was: 'Scream girls'.
2427,tt0888019,8234,16,AND AS FOR THE SCREAMING......
2428,tt0888019,8234,17,If you watch this please be sure to have some paracetamol at the ready!
2429,tt0888019,8235,1,As horror fans we all know that blind rentals are a crap shoot.
2430,tt0888019,8235,2,"Sometimes we find a real gem, but many times we find that the film we've just spent our hard earned money on is nothing more than a putrid steamer made worse by the completely undeserved rave reviews and film fest awards listed on the box."
2431,tt0888019,8235,3,Such is the case with Five Across the Eyes a title I'm sure is a double entendre referring to both the films budget and the compulsion anyone watching it might have to using all five fingers to stab their eyes out .
2432,tt0888019,8235,4,"The story, or, at least what the ahem writers think passes for one, centers on a group of teen girls who unwisely decide to go on a backwoods joyride late at night after leaving a football game and run afoul of a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a fender bender in a gas station parking lot."
2433,tt0888019,8235,5,"In fairness, it's an interesting idea."
2434,tt0888019,8235,6,Some of the best horrors have very simple story lines.
2435,tt0888019,8235,7,It's in the execution of Five Across the Eyes that this idea falls flat.
2436,tt0888019,8235,8,The film tries to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project with its shaky camera work and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its bare bones approach to the material but succeeds at being neither.
2437,tt0888019,8235,9,"What we get instead are redundant scenes of chase, torture, release; chase torture, release, in that order for 94 minutes with long interludes of bitching, moaning, and incoherent rambling acting as plenty of padding in between chase sequences."
2438,tt0888019,8235,10,"The look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark, which, in a better made film might have enhanced the tension and the realism."
2439,tt0888019,8235,11,Here it's merely annoying.
2440,tt0888019,8235,12,The characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hard pressed to find anything to sympathize with them.
2441,tt0888019,8235,13,One character stops to get a first aid kit and tend to some scrapes on her face while gunshots heard in the background indicate her friends may be getting killed.
2442,tt0888019,8235,14,"Another girl mutters hilariously dumb lines like ""Don't go out there, she'll get you, if she gets you she'll kill you and if she kill's you you're dead""."
2443,tt0888019,8235,15,It was an accolade from Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral.com listed on the box that compelled me to check this one out.
2444,tt0888019,8235,16,Talk about a fake orgasm!
2445,tt0888019,8235,17,Perhaps my expectations would have been met had this been in the comedy section.
2446,tt0888019,8235,18,I'm all for low budget Indie horror but this one takes the crap cake.
2447,tt0888019,8235,19,Give Five Across the Eyes or FATE; get it. a pass.
2448,tt0888019,8235,20,RazorFriendly gives FATE 1 slash out of five /
2449,tt0888019,8236,1,I can't believe this is on DVD.
2450,tt0888019,8236,2,Even less it was available at my local video store.
2451,tt0888019,8236,3,Some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a 4000$ budget.
2452,tt0888019,8236,4,I find this funny.
2453,tt0888019,8236,5,I would find it very bad whichever the budget.
2454,tt0888019,8236,6,"Still more funny, I read the following in another review: ""Dramatics aside, if you love horror and you love something along the lines of Duel 1971 updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in, you'll love this movie."""
2455,tt0888019,8236,7,What.!.
2456,tt0888019,8236,8,This is a shame comparing those two movies.
2457,tt0888019,8236,9,"I give a ""1"", since I can't give a ""0""."
2458,tt0888019,8236,10,I just don't see any way this movie could be entertaining.
2459,tt0888019,8237,1,"How, in the name of all that's holy, did this film ever get distribution."
2460,tt0888019,8237,2,It looks as if it has been shot on someone's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths.
2461,tt0888019,8237,3,They literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie.
2462,tt0888019,8237,4,And that's all they do.
2463,tt0888019,8237,5,"There is no plot, no tension, no characters, and not a lot of acting."
2464,tt0888019,8237,6,Just screaming and more screaming.
2465,tt0888019,8237,7,I gave up after fifteen minutes and fast wound through it to see if anything happened.
2466,tt0888019,8237,8,"It doesn't except for screaming, of course."
2467,tt0888019,8237,9,"Odlly enough, the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem there is no camera work to speak of."
2468,tt0888019,8237,10,"Every shot looks like every other shot middle distance, one angle, dull, dull, DULL.It's not so bad it's good."
2469,tt0888019,8237,11,It's just plain bad.
2470,tt0888019,8238,1,This film was positively the worst film I have ever watched.
2471,tt0888019,8238,2,I couldn't sit through the whole thing.
2472,tt0888019,8238,3,I also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping...
2473,tt0888019,8238,4,I mean what was that all about!
2474,tt0888019,8238,5,I cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have #ingwasted a ¬£4 rental fee.
2475,tt0888019,8238,6,"The quality both picture and sound are terrible, the acting... well doesn't exist ."
2476,tt0888019,8238,7,"It was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee, crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup."
2477,tt0888019,8238,8,Urghh.......
2478,tt0888019,8238,9,AVOID AT ALL COST!
2479,tt0888019,8238,10,The girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos they'd be willing to take their tops off...
2480,tt0888019,8238,11,While these girls have nice bodies it certainly didn't make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears.
2481,tt0888019,8238,12,This was like possibly worse than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car.!
2482,tt0888019,8238,13,Definatey not one to buy folks.
2483,tt0888019,8238,14,Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but I could not find anything positive to say and I would like to think I may save someone else wasting their money like I have.
2484,tt0888019,8239,1,This really is the most dreadful film I have ever seen.
2485,tt0888019,8239,2,I simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this on release.
2486,tt0888019,8239,3,The production standards are atrocious.
2487,tt0888019,8239,4,There is no pretence here at cinematography.
2488,tt0888019,8239,5,"The camera work, scripting, acting and sound are unbelievably crass."
2489,tt0888019,8239,6,"I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes sparing us the time to watch it."
2490,tt0888019,8239,7,The hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece have no credibility whatsoever.
2491,tt0888019,8239,8,I would urge anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this Title.
2492,tt0888019,8239,9,It is truly atrocious.
2493,tt0888019,8239,10,JDD 14 December 2008
2494,tt0888019,8240,1,Do not waste your time watching this!
2495,tt0888019,8240,2,Unless you want to study it for all the wrong things you shouldn't do to make a good film.
2496,tt0888019,8240,3,"I am not one to usually review a movie, but this one is personal."
2497,tt0888019,8240,4,I wasted precious time which they cannot give back.
2498,tt0888019,8240,5,I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this crap.
2499,tt0888019,8240,6,"If this was a student project, i would have to say not bad, but only for the first 15 min... after that it gets annoying. the screaming, the bad audio, the bad video a good camera man could have made it much better. and yes, whats with the Blair Witch effect. no budget."
2500,tt0888019,8240,7,"I was hoping it was going to get better, but it doesn't."
2501,tt0888019,8240,8,Now how the hell did it deserves a 4. 2 is more fair but 1 for wasting my time!
2502,tt0888019,8240,9,I have said my peace.
2503,tt0888019,8241,1,This movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school.
2504,tt0888019,8241,2,I have to give it credit on its campiness though.
2505,tt0888019,8241,3,Many times throughout the movie I found myself laughing hysterically.
2506,tt0888019,8241,4,"It was so bad at times that it was comical, which made it a fun watch."
2507,tt0888019,8241,5,"If you're looking for a low grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness, then pop a bowl of popcorn, invite some friends over, and have some fun."
2508,tt0888019,8241,6,I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad.
2509,tt0888019,8241,7,Dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there.
2510,tt0888019,8242,1,"After just watching FIVE ACROSS THE EYES, I gotta be honest..."
2511,tt0888019,8242,2,I just didn't like it.
2512,tt0888019,8242,3,"I had read so many good reviews on this movie, but I just did'nt get where these reviews have came from,I have got a lot of time for newcomers into film making, and I'm sure the directors will do well for themselves, but the budget they had was the main problem, there was two cameras used in the entire film which was OK but they seemed like really cheap cameras."
2513,tt0888019,8242,4,"Another problem was the sound, you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time, all talking on top of each other it's just impossible to hear what they're saying."
2514,tt0888019,8242,5,"It had a good idea going for it, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car then drive off, a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit, driven by a mad woman, who wants to kill them, and has plenty of chances to do so!...and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape, but don't!"
2515,tt0888019,8242,6,Very frustrating...
2516,tt0888019,8242,7,I only just scraped through this one!
2517,tt0888019,8243,1,"The word in the summary sums it up d'oh ; Five girls get lost trying to find their way home, when they stop at a store to get directions they hit a parked car breaking one headlight on it, they flea the scene in fair of getting in trouble but suddenly they see one headlight coming up behind them ooooh."
2518,tt0888019,8243,2,"From there out everything is screaming, crying and violence when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost it because of a headlight ;, well the screaming and crying pretty much stays through the entire movie very annoying The movie is shot, with a cheap camera trying to make it seem ""real"" or ""shocking"" I guess, it's just embarrassing and useless though."
2519,tt0888019,8243,3,"In lack of anything better to compare it with, ""Blair witch style""."
2520,tt0888019,8243,4,"The screaming and crying for pretty much the entire movie with crappy sound was over the top annoying, you literally get a headache :I'm sorry but this was not scary, only an annoying painful piece of crap movie."
2521,tt0888019,8244,1,I think this movie was supposed to be shocking.
2522,tt0888019,8244,2,But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made ...and simply is.
2523,tt0888019,8244,3,It's one and a half hour of torment.
2524,tt0888019,8244,4,Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie the five girls.
2525,tt0888019,8244,5,"Sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically fine, since it's a horror movie."
2526,tt0888019,8244,6,And I usually like horror movies.
2527,tt0888019,8244,7,I've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se.
2528,tt0888019,8244,8,However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever.
2529,tt0888019,8244,9,It's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque.
2530,tt0888019,8244,10,"It's so lame it even gets boring, and really quick too."
2531,tt0888019,8244,11,"The worst thing if the above wasn't bad enough for ya about this movie is that they've tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project, by filming with cheap hand held cameras."
2532,tt0888019,8244,12,"But again, this too serves no end whatsoever."
2533,tt0888019,8244,13,"In the ""Blair Which"", sure enough, there's an explanation, namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch."
2534,tt0888019,8244,14,"In this film, there's no other explanation than: ""Hey ya'll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch!!"""
2535,tt0888019,8244,15,The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about.
2536,tt0888019,8244,16,The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying.
2537,tt0888019,8244,17,"Also, no effort has been made to make anything any better, sound wise or other wise."
2538,tt0888019,8244,18,"Than finally, there's the soundtrack, which is just as bad as the rest, and varies from cheap euro house to the worst grungy hard rock..."
2539,tt0888019,8244,19,My advise: Don't watch this under ANY circumstances.
2540,tt0888019,8245,1,I can't believe anyone liked this movie.
2541,tt0888019,8245,2,"I've seen a lot of low budget indie films, but this one absolutely sucked."
2542,tt0888019,8245,3,Low budget doesn't mean the movie has to be demented.
2543,tt0888019,8245,4,Horror doesn't mean the movie has to be demented.
2544,tt0888019,8245,5,There was nothing scary about this movie at all.
2545,tt0888019,8245,6,"It was just a gore fest, and a particularly disturbing one at that."
2546,tt0888019,8245,7,"The acting was average, considering they were all unheard of actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialog was pathetic."
2547,tt0888019,8245,8,"The movie tries to come off as ""artistic"", or something."
2548,tt0888019,8245,9,"This is not one of those really great indie films that cost only thousands of dollars to make, but are incredibly well done."
2549,tt0888019,8245,10,This was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions on film.
2550,tt0888019,8245,11,"Other reviews here also said that the soundtrack sucked...that's because most of it was written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the movie."
2551,tt0888019,8245,12,There were no redeeming qualities to this movie at all.
2552,tt0888019,8245,13,A complete waste of my time and money.
2553,tt0926129,644,1,"We have all been asking ourselves ""why don't they remake the slasher films that were only OK instead of remaking the ones that were great already, that way they can only make it better."" well with Prom Night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s Jamie Lee Curtis film and made it even WORSE."
2554,tt0926129,644,2,"Its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens hence no violence etc, the knife in this slasher flick is blunt."
2555,tt0926129,644,3,The director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window.
2556,tt0926129,644,4,The cast who include Britney Snow who was superb in Hairspray try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared.
2557,tt0926129,644,5,More annoying is how the death scenes are handled we will hear the attack but wont see it.
2558,tt0926129,644,6,It also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids Yet in pours the money from Americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office!!!
2559,tt0926129,644,7,Slasher movies are a lot of fun but in Prom Nights case it made me want to download the original.
2560,tt0926129,644,8,I've seen scarier OC and Dawsons Creek episodes
2561,tt0926129,645,1,"When I first saw the preview for this movie, I really couldn't wait to see it."
2562,tt0926129,645,2,The plot seemed good and the setting was great.
2563,tt0926129,645,3,"I mean, a slasher movie that takes place on prom night, great idea!!"
2564,tt0926129,645,4,"And the plot: A High School teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students, goes crazy, gets arrested, and escapes three years later on prom night!"
2565,tt0926129,645,5,"Prom night, a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable, turns into hell!!"
2566,tt0926129,645,6,"However, I saw it and was extremely disappointed."
2567,tt0926129,645,7,"It was not only the worst ""horror movie"" I have ever seen, but it was one of the worst movie in general that I have ever seen!!"
2568,tt0926129,645,8,"First of all, it wasn't even scary."
2569,tt0926129,645,9,There was not one moment in that movie when I jumped out of my seat.
2570,tt0926129,645,10,"Also, the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull."
2571,tt0926129,645,11,All the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats.
2572,tt0926129,645,12,Also there was absolutely no gore its rated PG 13.
2573,tt0926129,645,13,The scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl.
2574,tt0926129,645,14,He slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them they don't actually show him cutting her throat.
2575,tt0926129,645,15,"Next, you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie."
2576,tt0926129,645,16,"He isn't mysterious, creepy, or scary."
2577,tt0926129,645,17,He's just this guy who kills people.
2578,tt0926129,645,18,"Also, everything in the movie was so clich√©."
2579,tt0926129,645,19,"An example is when, at the end, the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment, the detective shoots and kills him."
2580,tt0926129,645,20,"Also, every single thing in this movie was so predictable."
2581,tt0926129,645,21,"The victim, after seeing the guy with a knife, runs for her life, hides, thinks she gets away, and then the killer just pops out and kills her."
2582,tt0926129,645,22,"Finally, the sequence of the movie was extremely bad."
2583,tt0926129,645,23,"The guy goes into the hotel, kills a few people, the bodies are discovered, someone pulls the fire alarm, and everyone evacuates."
2584,tt0926129,645,24,"The main character forgets something in her room, has an encounter with the killer, runs and escapes."
2585,tt0926129,645,25,Thats it!
2586,tt0926129,645,26,"She and her boyfriend go home, the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house, finds the girl, then gets killed by the detective."
2587,tt0926129,645,27,The movie sequence was so stupid and clich√©.
2588,tt0926129,645,28,"If your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good, trust me, don't waste your time or money."
2589,tt0926129,645,29,No wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater.
2590,tt0926129,645,30,"My friend and I, along with these two girls sitting in the back, were the only ones in the theater."
2591,tt0926129,645,31,That should have told me something about the movie beforehand.
2592,tt0926129,646,1,"i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident...well it must of been. blonde women being stalked,the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute's then disappearing and reappearing,hiding.he was'nt even a super hero so i don't know how he did it.he could'nt frighten a cat and that's not hard to do.the old ""mirror in the bathroom""is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago. you had the cop on the trail of the villain,another clich√©played by idris elba with a very convincing American accent,he's from London the director did'nt have a clue and has made a film full of clich√©'s and make's ""scary move""which was a COMEDY look scary. pathetic!"
2593,tt0926129,647,1,The acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay.
2594,tt0926129,647,2,It was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes.
2595,tt0926129,647,3,The ending was even worse.
2596,tt0926129,647,4,"Everyone kept dying, but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly OK!"
2597,tt0926129,647,5,"They did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had, etc."
2598,tt0926129,647,6,The movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline.
2599,tt0926129,647,7,The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I kind of feel bad for the young actors.
2600,tt0926129,647,8,They needed better coaching.
2601,tt0926129,647,9,"They could have really made this an OK film, but the screenplay and acting failed miserably."
2602,tt0926129,648,1,The night of the prom: the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic.
2603,tt0926129,648,2,And so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives.
2604,tt0926129,648,3,There really is no excuse for Prom Night.
2605,tt0926129,648,4,There is less than nothing original about it and I truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on IMDb.
2606,tt0926129,648,5,The only part of my viewing that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts'.
2607,tt0926129,648,6,It was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them.
2608,tt0926129,648,7,The plot was basically some guy going on a rampage.
2609,tt0926129,648,8,"And the thing was, it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage."
2610,tt0926129,648,9,"Maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame Robbie Williams lookalike with a baseball cap, I might have sat there feeling slightly anxious."
2611,tt0926129,648,10,"The fact that I cared less about the characters than I did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn't really add to the effect, either."
2612,tt0926129,648,11,"And to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally one dimensional and oblivious."
2613,tt0926129,648,12,The hotel staff didn't seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave.
2614,tt0926129,648,13,"I was incredibly surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was."
2615,tt0926129,648,14,"She realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs, entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets."
2616,tt0926129,648,15,Nice one.
2617,tt0926129,648,16,"The worst thing was, I hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest."
2618,tt0926129,648,17,He really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening.
2619,tt0926129,648,18,Shocking!
2620,tt0926129,648,19,"And the music, don't even get me started."
2621,tt0926129,648,20,It was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral.
2622,tt0926129,648,21,I really wish that Prom Night was a joke.
2623,tt0926129,648,22,It was terrible and stupidly predictable.
2624,tt0926129,648,23,"No one, in their right mind or otherwise, has any reason to see this film."
2625,tt0926129,648,24,Mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation.
2626,tt0926129,648,25,"If you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film, hear my plea."
2627,tt0926129,648,26,Don't do it.
2628,tt0926129,648,27,There are better things to spend six pounds on.
2629,tt0926129,648,28,Like a sheet to play ghosts with.
2630,tt0926129,649,1,OK this movie was made for one reason and one reason only TO MAKE MONEY!!
2631,tt0926129,649,2,The producers obviously didn't care about killing a classic horror movie.
2632,tt0926129,649,3,I knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg 13 how many pg 13 slashers movies have turned out to be good.
2633,tt0926129,649,4,Thats like asking how many women have been on the moon.
2634,tt0926129,649,5,The answer is NONE!!
2635,tt0926129,649,6,Prom night 1980 was of cource no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be recognised as a movie that stays true to its genre and deosnt try to be anything more than that.
2636,tt0926129,649,7,"My problem with Prom night 2008 is the way that it handles the killer and i have 3 major problems with him.....................1The way he escapes, he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent!!"
2637,tt0926129,649,8,WHAT THE HELL. why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room.
2638,tt0926129,649,9,Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something.
2639,tt0926129,649,10,"2His intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self, he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her, so does he want to kill her, love her or just plain rape her.."
2640,tt0926129,649,11,"3 The killer is too good, how did he develop all of his skills."
2641,tt0926129,649,12,"He used to be a teacher, so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of her asleep and she doesn't notice, it all silly 2 stars out of 10 terrible,silly,stupid attempt at a horror movie"
2642,tt0926129,650,1,"Why Hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes but is it considerably worse why Hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that weren't brilliant to start with Prom Night, The Amityville Horror Much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere, character or any genuine scares at all."
2643,tt0926129,650,2,"Prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch, but for all the wrong reasons."
2644,tt0926129,650,3,"It's a poorly acted, massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do."
2645,tt0926129,650,4,It's clear Hollywood Horror is dead.
2646,tt0926129,650,5,Even The likes of The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot.
2647,tt0926129,650,6,Prom night is virtually bloodless and I'm not even going to mention how bad the plot is.
2648,tt0926129,650,7,Its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm... the original.
2649,tt0926129,650,8,One of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be.
2650,tt0926129,650,9,"Donna Keppel Brittany Snow has survived a terrible tragedy, but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style."
2651,tt0926129,650,10,"When the big night finally arrives, Donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn."
2652,tt0926129,650,11,"But while Donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future, the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance."
2653,tt0926129,650,12,"An obsessed killer is on the loose, and he'll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only Donna."
2654,tt0926129,650,13,"Who will survive to see graduation day, and what will Donna do when she's forced to confront her greatest fear."
2655,tt0926129,650,14,"Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davis co star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor."
2656,tt0926129,650,15,A plot that will probably put you off going to see this.
2657,tt0926129,650,16,Witch if you ask me is a good thing.
2658,tt0926129,650,17,"Without much to work with, McCormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations."
2659,tt0926129,650,18,"At one point, a girl backs into a floor lamp a lamp!"
2660,tt0926129,650,19,and McCormick tries to pump it up into a jump scare moment.
2661,tt0926129,650,20,Desperate times really do call for desperate measures.
2662,tt0926129,650,21,There haven't been this many shots of closets since the last IKEA catalogue.
2663,tt0926129,650,22,"In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there probably is a freaky, scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society's creepy obsession with youthful beauty."
2664,tt0926129,650,23,This is not that movie.
2665,tt0926129,650,24,My final verdict.
2666,tt0926129,650,25,Avoid at all cost.
2667,tt0926129,650,26,"Nobody will like Prom Night, it's even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack job remakes."
2668,tt0926129,650,27,Considering its absolute lack of blood or frights.
2669,tt0926129,650,28,A night you'll be in a hurry to forget.
2670,tt0926129,651,1,I saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts.
2671,tt0926129,651,2,"I must admit, I found it pretty decent...until I started to THINK about what the characters were saying."
2672,tt0926129,651,3,Logical problems:1.
2673,tt0926129,651,4,"Her boyfriend, who seems to be a pretty fit dude, makes no sound while being killed."
2674,tt0926129,651,5,Don't you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer.
2675,tt0926129,651,6,2
2676,tt0926129,651,7,"When the remark is made that the gym teacher is ""SOOOO in love with Lisa,"" I almost screamed at the screen."
2677,tt0926129,651,8,"When your best friend's family HAS BEEN KILLED BY A TEACHER WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH HER, you don't make comments like that if you have half of a heart.3."
2678,tt0926129,651,9,"As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead, wouldn't the smart thing to do be to get Donna, boyfriend, aunt, and uncle into a car and drive far, far away, then bait the house with the HRT and police force so that the killer has no way to get out."
2679,tt0926129,651,10,I could go on.
2680,tt0926129,651,11,And on.
2681,tt0926129,651,12,And on.
2682,tt0926129,651,13,"Basically, the plot was decent, the characters weren't profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors."
2683,tt0926129,651,14,"HOWEVER.This movie might be good for teenagers, or young couples just looking for a fun night out."
2684,tt0926129,651,15,"If you don't consider all the goofs, it's a mediocre film."
2685,tt0926129,652,1,I think it was an overrated PG 13 crap!
2686,tt0926129,652,2,"At least BRITTANY SNOW's performance was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were good too, but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing."
2687,tt0926129,652,3,The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too.
2688,tt0926129,652,4,"The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginals."
2689,tt0926129,652,5,The movie was very boring too and very overrated.
2690,tt0926129,652,6,"It wasn't suspenseful at all, i almost fall asleep."
2691,tt0926129,652,7,"Its another bad PG 13 remake, its really a dreadful movie IMO."
2692,tt0926129,652,8,The ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring.
2693,tt0926129,652,9,The movie is pretty slow too.
2694,tt0926129,652,10,"Overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe BRITTANY SNOW i think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA too, but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake."
2695,tt0926129,652,11,Well thats just my opinion. i gave it a 2/10.
2696,tt0926129,653,1,"If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be in the minus numbers."
2697,tt0926129,653,2,"While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible ""horror"" films, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time."
2698,tt0926129,653,3,"Despite it being a horror film, there is nothing scary about it, unless the idea of seeing how many horror clich√©'s you can fit in one movie scares you."
2699,tt0926129,653,4,"If the rating had been higher, it probably would have made for a better film in the long run."
2700,tt0926129,653,5,"Whoever made this version of ""Prom Night"", you screwed up."
2701,tt0926129,653,6,The actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting.
2702,tt0926129,653,7,This was a terrible waste of a cinema trip.
2703,tt0926129,653,8,"I'd sooner go and see ""One Missed Call"" again, at least that had some plot."
2704,tt0926129,654,1,"""Prom Night"" is a title only remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen."
2705,tt0926129,654,2,"This movie takes place in an Oregon town, where Donna Brittany Snow is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years."
2706,tt0926129,654,3,"She and her friends arrive at the prom, which is taking place in a grand hotel, and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives."
2707,tt0926129,654,4,"Little does anyone know, a man from Donna's past, who has haunted her for years, is also at the prom... and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her."
2708,tt0926129,654,5,"I'm a fan of the original ""Prom Night"", so I tried to maintain a little hope in this movie, but I have to admit I was quite disappointed."
2709,tt0926129,654,6,"""Prom Night"" suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have, and that is predictability."
2710,tt0926129,654,7,"There are absolutely no surprises here, and I felt I had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times, often better, before."
2711,tt0926129,654,8,What does this equate to for the audience.
2712,tt0926129,654,9,Boredom.
2713,tt0926129,654,10,"Unless of course you have never seen any horror movies, or are part of the pre teen crowd, but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen."
2714,tt0926129,654,11,"The plot is simplistic, but the entire script is void of any type of surprise, twist, atmosphere, or anything, and this really, really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into."
2715,tt0926129,654,12,It all just seemed very bland.
2716,tt0926129,654,13,"A lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a PG 13 slasher movie as well, and I understand what they are saying, but I don't think it's impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore."
2717,tt0926129,654,14,"Take Carpenter's ""Halloween"" for example little to no on screen violence, but still an extremely frightening and effective movie."
2718,tt0926129,654,15,"You don't need gore to make a film scary, but even had ""Prom Night"" been gratuitously violent which it is not, it is very tame, it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with."
2719,tt0926129,654,16,"The tension and suspense here is mild at best, and I spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations, and was correct about 99% of the time."
2720,tt0926129,654,17,"Our characters aren't well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them, and their by the numbers demises are routine and careless."
2721,tt0926129,654,18,"I will point out a few things I did like about this movie, though, because it wasn't completely useless the cinematography is really nice, and everything was very well filmed and fairly stylish."
2722,tt0926129,654,19,"Among the ""jump"" scares that are for the most part very predictable, there were a few that were kind of clever."
2723,tt0926129,654,20,"The sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold, however predictable the unfolding may be."
2724,tt0926129,654,21,"As for the acting, it's mediocre at best."
2725,tt0926129,654,22,"Brittany Snow plays the lead decently, but really the rest of the cast doesn't show off much talent."
2726,tt0926129,654,23,"Johnathan Schaech plays the villain, and is probably the most experienced performer here, but even he isn't that impressive."
2727,tt0926129,654,24,"However, I did like the character he played, which was a nice change from the typical 'masked stalker' type killer we see a lot."
2728,tt0926129,654,25,"As far as the ending goes, the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wit's end and it was very anti climactic."
2729,tt0926129,654,26,"Overall, ""Prom Night"" was a disappointment."
2730,tt0926129,654,27,"Everything was very by the numbers, routine, and predictable, which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie."
2731,tt0926129,654,28,"There were a few neat moments, but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere, and had little plot development, nor believable characters."
2732,tt0926129,654,29,"I'd advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till it's out on video, or rent the original instead, because there are absolutely no surprises here."
2733,tt0926129,654,30,"Some may find a little entertainment in it, but it was far too predictable for my tastes."
2734,tt0926129,654,31,"I expected better, and left the theater very disappointed."
2735,tt0926129,654,32,3/10.
2736,tt0926129,655,1,"I went into this with my hopes up, by twenty minutes into the movie I couldn't have been more let down."
2737,tt0926129,655,2,"Despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake, I kept my hopes high that maybe...just maybe someone would get it right this time around."
2738,tt0926129,655,3,"Sadly, Prom Night is about on the same quality level as the recent April Fools Day remake, bad script, bad direction, cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror."
2739,tt0926129,655,4,"From beginning to end it's boring, repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls."
2740,tt0926129,655,5,We've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better then this.
2741,tt0926129,655,6,"If you go to see Prom Night in the theater I'd say wait for the DVD or PPV, get ready for the audience to laugh, because laugh they will."
2742,tt0926129,655,7,"The laughs aren't at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny, they are in response to key ""thrilling"" moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of Scary Movie."
2743,tt0926129,655,8,"Seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof."
2744,tt0926129,655,9,"The film makers missed the mark so badly here, that a large number of the audience in the theater I attended walked out about halfway through the movie."
2745,tt0926129,655,10,"Which in retrospect, I wish I had done."
2746,tt0926129,655,11,"Not me though, I had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better."
2747,tt0926129,655,12,Needless to say It didn't.
2748,tt0926129,655,13,"The ""horror"" scenes are a joke, not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction, the script, the ""special effects"" and the camera work."
2749,tt0926129,655,14,"The movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it, but still came out of it with a micro budget movie."
2750,tt0926129,655,15,I halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking I would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere.
2751,tt0926129,655,16,"This movies scary alright, if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed."
2752,tt0926129,656,1,Note: I couldn't force myself to actually write up a constructive review of Prom Night.
2753,tt0926129,656,2,It just can't be done.
2754,tt0926129,656,3,"Instead, I went through what I thought about while watching the movie."
2755,tt0926129,656,4,"Things that I thought about while watching Prom Night: I'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place, only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it."
2756,tt0926129,656,5,"Of course, when I say ""elaborate deaths"", I mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach."
2757,tt0926129,656,6,"Didn't the whole ""it's just a dream"" thing get ruined by Dallas."
2758,tt0926129,656,7,"Speaking of which, I wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate death."
2759,tt0926129,656,8,The film is only ten minutes into and I can already count the horror clich√©s on two hands.
2760,tt0926129,656,9,Not a good sign.
2761,tt0926129,656,10,"Even after just meeting the protagonist's boyfriend, I'm convinced he will die."
2762,tt0926129,656,11,Anybody want to place bets.
2763,tt0926129,656,12,"The killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character, Donna."
2764,tt0926129,656,13,"By the way, does anybody think that ""Donna"" is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film."
2765,tt0926129,656,14,He spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds Donna celebrating her high school prom.
2766,tt0926129,656,15,"While there is no accounting for taste, I seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as Donna."
2767,tt0926129,656,16,High schools allow proms to take place at hotels and doesn't keep track of the students.
2768,tt0926129,656,17,Apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please.
2769,tt0926129,656,18,"I suppose if this plot point wasn't in place, the movie would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom."
2770,tt0926129,656,19,I suppose the trade off for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything.
2771,tt0926129,656,20,"I've already played ""count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat"" and ""guess how much money I have in my wallet"" and I'm only in the 20 minute mark."
2772,tt0926129,656,21,How else will I entertain myself.
2773,tt0926129,656,22,Note to self: Don't forget milk and bread on the way home.
2774,tt0926129,656,23,Dear screenwriter: You've used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year.
2775,tt0926129,656,24,"The 1980 version of this film wasn't that good but compared to this remake it was like Citizen Kane, or at least The Godfather."
2776,tt0926129,656,25,"It had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of her many post Halloween horror flicks and it did have a little ""twist"" at the end."
2777,tt0926129,656,26,I miss Jamie Lee.
2778,tt0926129,656,27,I wish she'd act more.
2779,tt0926129,656,28,Apparently at prom there isn't much dancing going on.
2780,tt0926129,656,29,Instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college.
2781,tt0926129,656,30,"I hear all these colleges being brought up by name, and I can't help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance exam to get in."
2782,tt0926129,656,31,The killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes.
2783,tt0926129,656,32,"That's the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room, there is no trace of a struggle."
2784,tt0926129,656,33,On another side note: This is a very lazy killer.
2785,tt0926129,656,34,Michael Myers went hunting after his victims.
2786,tt0926129,656,35,Just saying.
2787,tt0926129,656,36,It's official: the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer.
2788,tt0926129,656,37,What triggered it.
2789,tt0926129,656,38,Was it whenever Donna went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building.
2790,tt0926129,656,39,"Was it her constant dreams, and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee."
2791,tt0926129,656,40,Or was it Brittany Snow's unconvincing performance.
2792,tt0926129,656,41,I'll have to say it was all of the above.
2793,tt0926129,656,42,"Okay, who had ""he dies off screen in the third act""."
2794,tt0926129,656,43,You win the pot.
2795,tt0926129,656,44,"Finally, the movie is over."
2796,tt0926129,656,45,"My friend turns to me and says ""Donna wasn't too smart."""
2797,tt0926129,656,46,That's the understatement of the week.
2798,tt0926129,656,47,"Kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind, or a week long power outage is a slight inconvenience."
2799,tt0926129,656,48,I can't wait to get on Rotten Tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a favoring review.
2800,tt0926129,656,49,I can't recommend this.
2801,tt0926129,656,50,I refuse to recommend this.
2802,tt0926129,656,51,"This is as lazy of a horror film as any, and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers."
2803,tt0926129,656,52,"And unfortunately for theater patrons, alcohol isn't served."
2804,tt0926129,656,53,Rating:  out of
2805,tt0926129,657,1,"PROM NIGHT 2008directed by: Nelson McCormickstarring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davisplot: Three years ago, Donna Brittany Snow witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher Jonathan Schaech who has a bit of a crush on her."
2806,tt0926129,657,2,"Now, she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends."
2807,tt0926129,657,3,"Once there, they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. pros: I got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves."
2808,tt0926129,657,4,An example:Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her she doesn't seem that great has escaped from prison.
2809,tt0926129,657,5,Their reason: They don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends.
2810,tt0926129,657,6,LOLcons: Let me start off by saying I'm a huge slasher fan.
2811,tt0926129,657,7,Usually I can have fun with even the bad ones.
2812,tt0926129,657,8,I even like some PG 13 horror films.
2813,tt0926129,657,9,"TOURIST TRAP 1979, one of my favorites, was originally rated PG."
2814,tt0926129,657,10,I also enjoy POLTERGEIST 1982 and THE GRUDGE 2004.
2815,tt0926129,657,11,So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG 13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie.
2816,tt0926129,657,12,"First of all, I had a big problem with the story."
2817,tt0926129,657,13,I like slasher films that don't even have stories.
2818,tt0926129,657,14,At least they can be entertaining.
2819,tt0926129,657,15,"This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family."
2820,tt0926129,657,16,"A few years later, he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends ...."
2821,tt0926129,657,17,Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about.
2822,tt0926129,657,18,"Claire Jessica Stroup is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I couldn't care less."
2823,tt0926129,657,19,"This should have been a Lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT."
2824,tt0926129,657,20,And then ... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes.
2825,tt0926129,657,21,"I don't even care that it's not that gory, some of my favorite slashers HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT were not that gory but they still had effective murders."
2826,tt0926129,657,22,"Here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen, a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds, and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony."
2827,tt0926129,657,23,"I'm sure that 10 year old girls were terrified, but not me."
2828,tt0926129,657,24,I also hated the characters.
2829,tt0926129,657,25,"There was Donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby Scott Porter and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male."
2830,tt0926129,657,26,"Then we had Donna's annoying friends Claire Stroup and Lisa Dana Davis, and the token mean girl Chrissy Brianne Davis."
2831,tt0926129,657,27,"If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying, try watching this movie."
2832,tt0926129,657,28,"And don't get me started on Ronnie Collins Pennie and the DJ Jay Phillips who gave me flashbacks to Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT.Add to all that predictable plot turns, a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material, and you have quite a stinker."
2833,tt0926129,658,1,I wish I could give this movie a zero out of ten.
2834,tt0926129,658,2,"Before going to this movie the day after it came out, I came on IMDb to check out the comments."
2835,tt0926129,658,3,A comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog.
2836,tt0926129,658,4,"I never go by other people's opinions, so I wasted seven dollars for this crap movie."
2837,tt0926129,658,5,It had to be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen.
2838,tt0926129,658,6,The person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff.
2839,tt0926129,658,7,Since when do scary movies have sappy scenes.
2840,tt0926129,658,8,"I swear, I'm amazed there weren't any GROUP HUG ^ ^ moments."
2841,tt0926129,658,9,I think I jumped.
2842,tt0926129,658,10,Once.
2843,tt0926129,658,11,"And that's because I zoned out, thinking about my research paper for English."
2844,tt0926129,658,12,"The clich√©d, birds/cat popping out of nowhere thing when you THOUGHT something was gonna happen."
2845,tt0926129,658,13,And the characters were STUPID.
2846,tt0926129,658,14,"My friend and I almost DIED laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said, ""I have to get my mom's shawl!!!"""
2847,tt0926129,658,15,You.
2848,tt0926129,658,16,Idiot.
2849,tt0926129,658,17,Screw the shawl!
2850,tt0926129,658,18,"Safety is just a few steps away, but NO, my mom's shawl that didn't match the dress By the way is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety."
2851,tt0926129,658,19,"And to top it all off, they take her BACK to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived."
2852,tt0926129,658,20,God.
2853,tt0926129,658,21,My friend and I also predicted the ENTIRE movie.
2854,tt0926129,658,22,"And not just the, I bet he's hiding under the bed, moments."
2855,tt0926129,658,23,"It was the, ""HE stole the bellhop's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel"" and ""It's the detective coming down the hallway, not the killer!"""
2856,tt0926129,658,24,moments.
2857,tt0926129,658,25,Movies should NEVER be THIS predictable.
2858,tt0926129,658,26,Disney movies aren't even this predictable.
2859,tt0926129,658,27,"I'm gonna complete my rant now by saying, this was a terrible movie."
2860,tt0926129,658,28,I'm glad I went to see it in theaters so I wouldn't buy it for $15.00 and then hate it.
2861,tt0926129,658,29,It was just bad.
2862,tt0926129,658,30,It would've been better if only one thing would've happened.
2863,tt0926129,658,31,"If, after being shot by the detective, the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in."
2864,tt0926129,658,32,"Knife in hand, falling and stabbing the girl on his way down."
2865,tt0926129,658,33,"Oh, how lovely that would've been."
2866,tt0926129,658,34,Don't waste your time or money.
2867,tt0926129,658,35,Go see a GOOD movie.
2868,tt0926129,659,1,This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood.
2869,tt0926129,659,2,The fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business.
2870,tt0926129,659,3,The idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot I rented the film is discouraging also.
2871,tt0926129,659,4,Obsessed teacher 3 years prior kills teenager's family because he wants her.
2872,tt0926129,659,5,"For no reason he kills the mother, father and brother."
2873,tt0926129,659,6,From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction.
2874,tt0926129,659,7,"Years later, obsessed teacher breaks out of prison."
2875,tt0926129,659,8,HMM usual bad writing no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute.
2876,tt0926129,659,9,"Obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniff out people and with a knife is super killer."
2877,tt0926129,659,10,Sure!!!
2878,tt0926129,659,11,"Now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason, knifes bellhop for the fun of it, and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends."
2879,tt0926129,659,12,Now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you.
2880,tt0926129,659,13,"Obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel again it is stupid, ever cop would know his face but he walks right by them."
2881,tt0926129,659,14,Now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend.
2882,tt0926129,659,15,There is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage.
2883,tt0926129,659,16,"If any other profession put out work of this low quality, they would be fired."
2884,tt0926129,659,17,Yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash.
2885,tt0926129,660,1,Good grief I can't even begin to describe how poor this film is.
2886,tt0926129,660,2,"Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting much to begin with."
2887,tt0926129,660,3,"Let's face it, a PG 13 slasher flick is pre destined to be missing the ummm... slashing, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore."
2888,tt0926129,660,4,But it was the level of incompetence and clich√© on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away.
2889,tt0926129,660,5,We have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy.
2890,tt0926129,660,6,And here's a turnup for the books...
2891,tt0926129,660,7,SHE NEVER CHANGES hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing character development.
2892,tt0926129,660,8,If you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again.
2893,tt0926129,660,9,"On top of this, we're handed possibly the least intriguing and definitely the least scary killer ever to grace the genre."
2894,tt0926129,660,10,I'm not joking when I say that Dora the Explorer has scarier villains than this movie.
2895,tt0926129,660,11,"Finally, because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept and apparently thirteen year old director, what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time."
2896,tt0926129,660,12,"Closets, that's what."
2897,tt0926129,660,13,"Lots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to Narnia, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year."
2898,tt0926129,660,14,"In fact this movie should have just been called ""CLOSET"", and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the DVD case."
2899,tt0926129,660,15,"On the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by Roger and Ebert something to the extent of: ""what the f@!"
2900,tt0926129,660,16,"did we just waste our time watching!"""
2901,tt0926129,661,1,Okay.
2902,tt0926129,661,2,So I just got back.
2903,tt0926129,661,3,"Before I start my review, let me tell you one thing: I wanted to like this movie."
2904,tt0926129,661,4,"I know I've been negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film."
2905,tt0926129,661,5,I didn't.
2906,tt0926129,661,6,It's not just the fact that every horror clich√© imaginable is in this.
2907,tt0926129,661,7,And it's not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare walking into a baseball bat left on the floor.
2908,tt0926129,661,8,Are you kidding me..
2909,tt0926129,661,9,It just wasn't scary.
2910,tt0926129,661,10,One thing I was surprised about: there was more blood than I thought there was going to be.. which isn't saying much.
2911,tt0926129,661,11,The film starts off with Donna being dropped off by Lisa's mom at her house.
2912,tt0926129,661,12,She comes in.. goes upstairs.
2913,tt0926129,661,13,Camera pans to her father dead on the couch.
2914,tt0926129,661,14,Spooky.
2915,tt0926129,661,15,"She goes upstairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens."
2916,tt0926129,661,16,"Finds her brother on his bed, apparently dead how could she tell."
2917,tt0926129,661,17,He didn't have a spot of blood on him.
2918,tt0926129,661,18,"Killer comes in, Donna hides under bed, mom dies."
2919,tt0926129,661,19,She runs outside screaming for help.
2920,tt0926129,661,20,"Killer behind her: ""I did it for us."""
2921,tt0926129,661,21,Cut to therapy session.
2922,tt0926129,661,22,This confused a lot of people everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back.
2923,tt0926129,661,23,Filler dialogue ensues.
2924,tt0926129,661,24,THey cut to the chase pretty quick.
2925,tt0926129,661,25,"Few scenes at the salon, they go to the hotel."
2926,tt0926129,661,26,"Of course the killer is already there for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago but the police/family weren't informed until he's already there."
2927,tt0926129,661,27,More filler ensues.
2928,tt0926129,661,28,"I'm not going to go on about what happens in the film, because I don't want to spoil it too much."
2929,tt0926129,661,29,"If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan made a post about it already."
2930,tt0926129,661,30,But on the subjects of deaths: they weren't that exciting.
2931,tt0926129,661,31,"People in the theatre actually laughed out loud an experience I've never had before in a horror movie, not even in When A Stranger Calls during several of them."
2932,tt0926129,661,32,One in particular: the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious 'scared' face I've ever seen.
2933,tt0926129,661,33,"The only death involving any blood was Lisa's, and that was pretty scarce."
2934,tt0926129,661,34,"Her throat is slashed, blood if you can even call it that it was practically black splatters on the curtain thing."
2935,tt0926129,661,35,The only other blood was on Claire when we see her body.
2936,tt0926129,661,36,"Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death."
2937,tt0926129,661,37,"Um, okay."
2938,tt0926129,661,38,The movie was one of the most clich√©d I've ever seen.
2939,tt0926129,661,39,Let's see here.. obligatory close mirror curtain BOOM!
2940,tt0926129,661,40,scene.
2941,tt0926129,661,41,Check.
2942,tt0926129,661,42,"Twice, actually you could tell they were struggling."
2943,tt0926129,661,43,Mandatory backing up into killer.
2944,tt0926129,661,44,Check.
2945,tt0926129,661,45,"There's also the backing up into lamp scene, but you've all seen that."
2946,tt0926129,661,46,"Oh, you say you want a birds flying away scare."
2947,tt0926129,661,47,"Well, you got it!"
2948,tt0926129,661,48,"Yes, they managed to incorporate one of those in here."
2949,tt0926129,661,49,"And, of course, the we have security on all exits but he still escaped scene."
2950,tt0926129,661,50,Shall I go on.
2951,tt0926129,661,51,I could.
2952,tt0926129,661,52,"For anyone saying the characters weren't stupid, are you kidding me."
2953,tt0926129,661,53,"""Oh, even though the massive alarm is ringing, literally saying PLEASE VACATE THE BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap."""
2954,tt0926129,661,54,These characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever.
2955,tt0926129,661,55,The only likable character Lisa made one of the most stupid moves in the movie.
2956,tt0926129,661,56,"""Oh, I just realized the psycho teacher is here!"
2957,tt0926129,661,57,I must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her!
2958,tt0926129,661,58,"Oh, shoot, the elevator is being to slow."
2959,tt0926129,661,59,"Guess I'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site!"""
2960,tt0926129,661,60,Ugh.
2961,tt0926129,661,61,"By the end of the film, they all deserved to die."
2962,tt0926129,661,62,"The only death anyone felt any remorse for was Donna's boyfriend I can't even remember his name is that bad., and by that time, the audience was completely drained out of this scareless, clich√©d film."
2963,tt0926129,661,63,"There were SOME positives the acting was decent for the most part, and it was well shot."
2964,tt0926129,661,64,But that's about it.
2965,tt0926129,661,65,"I'd give it a 1/5, and that's being generous."
2966,tt0926129,661,66,"Just for the laughs and believe me, the audience had a few, and Brittany Snow."
2967,tt0926129,661,67,"Oh, and the reaction was bad."
2968,tt0926129,661,68,Very bad.
2969,tt0926129,661,69,People were boo ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative.
2970,tt0926129,661,70,Expect bad legs for this one.
2971,tt0926129,662,1,and rent a GOOD horror movie.
2972,tt0926129,662,2,"It's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clich√©d and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movie""."
2973,tt0926129,662,3,In between the scary bits is the most BANAL and BORING dialog ever written.
2974,tt0926129,662,4,"Stupid ""we're going to the prom"" junk."
2975,tt0926129,662,5,I wanted to claw my ears off.
2976,tt0926129,662,6,"Honestly, ""The Hills"" has better dialog."
2977,tt0926129,662,7,There really was no need to make this movie.
2978,tt0926129,662,8,"Leading lady is uninteresting and I kept thinking ""Her."
2979,tt0926129,662,9,Really.
2980,tt0926129,662,10,Guy is obsessed with her.
2981,tt0926129,662,11,"Really."""
2982,tt0926129,662,12,"All the characters act in stupid ways, including the police."
2983,tt0926129,662,13,Cover the place in teams of 2!
2984,tt0926129,662,14,Front and back!
2985,tt0926129,662,15,Not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed.
2986,tt0926129,662,16,The serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem.
2987,tt0926129,662,17,No resistance from victims or doors.
2988,tt0926129,662,18,Nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door.
2989,tt0926129,662,19,The people are like mentally disabled sheep.
2990,tt0926129,662,20,"By the by, if you're a gore fan, you'll be disappointed too."
2991,tt0926129,662,21,All the killing is kept offscreen and is ahem tastefully done.
2992,tt0926129,662,22,So boo hoo for you!
2993,tt0926129,662,23,None of the killings is the least bit interesting.
2994,tt0926129,662,24,Most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out.
2995,tt0926129,662,25,The only clich√© missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies.
2996,tt0926129,662,26,"""Oh kitty!"
2997,tt0926129,662,27,You scared me!
2998,tt0926129,662,28,"I thought you were the killer AIIEEEE!"""
2999,tt0926129,662,29,"And then at the end when it's time for the killer to die well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice."
3000,tt0926129,662,30,Snore.
3001,tt0926129,662,31,The audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout.
3002,tt0926129,662,32,It was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough.
3003,tt0926129,662,33,Don't encourage this kind of lazy film making.
3004,tt0926129,662,34,"Oh, and by the way no crowning of a prom king or queen."
3005,tt0926129,662,35,No tiara.
3006,tt0926129,662,36,No bucket of blood.
3007,tt0926129,662,37,"So save your money and rent ""Carrie"" or ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween"" or ""Scream"" or ""Scary Movie"" any of them to get a good scare with some original twists."
3008,tt0926129,663,1,Imagine the scenario you are at the movie theater only because you are in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the Museums.
3009,tt0926129,663,2,You think you might go see the Sarah Marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain.
3010,tt0926129,663,3,It's sold out.
3011,tt0926129,663,4,Options.
3012,tt0926129,663,5,"The Bank Job, In Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom night."
3013,tt0926129,663,6,"You've seen the Bank Job suprisingly decent heist movie that and In Bruges again, pretty good so you're down to two."
3014,tt0926129,663,7,"You don't fancy watching Clooney or the nice one from the Office run around in 1930 football uniforms, so you go see Prom Night right."
3015,tt0926129,663,8,Wrong.
3016,tt0926129,663,9,"You take the $8.50, walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $8.50."
3017,tt0926129,663,10,It would be money better spent.
3018,tt0926129,663,11,It actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever it is supposed to be.
3019,tt0926129,663,12,If I was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut I wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry.
3020,tt0926129,663,13,Probably both.
3021,tt0926129,663,14,"An insult to anyone's intelligence... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie, as for the acting, they might as well have cast robots or maybe dogs in the roles, they would have been more realistic."
3022,tt0926129,663,15,The detective has to be possibly the worst actor I have ever seen Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan I hate his acting so much I don't care how you spell his name you are relieved on your titles So in summary 'not good'
3023,tt0926129,664,1,"I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon ""retellings"", but this film truly peeved me off."
3024,tt0926129,664,2,"The original Prom Night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror."
3025,tt0926129,664,3,There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film.
3026,tt0926129,664,4,Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience.
3027,tt0926129,664,5,"Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not!"
3028,tt0926129,664,6,"The scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly."
3029,tt0926129,664,7,"A good example of scare which has been done to clich√©d excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film This film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film."
3030,tt0926129,664,8,There needs to be a likable hero or heroine.
3031,tt0926129,664,9,This film doesn't have one.
3032,tt0926129,664,10,The person I most identified with was the head detective.
3033,tt0926129,664,11,"His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have."
3034,tt0926129,664,12,Common sense approach to events that occur.
3035,tt0926129,664,13,"If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction."
3036,tt0926129,664,14,"Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path."
3037,tt0926129,664,15,"If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone."
3038,tt0926129,664,16,"And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself."
3039,tt0926129,664,17,These clich√©s are tired and well overplayed.
3040,tt0926129,664,18,"In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular."
3041,tt0926129,665,1,"In Bridgeport, the deranged high school teacher Richard Fenton Johnathon Schaech is obsessed by the teenager student Donna Keppel Brittany Snow; she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life."
3042,tt0926129,665,2,"Three years later, the traumatized Donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills."
3043,tt0926129,665,3,"On her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby Scott Porter and two couples of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party."
3044,tt0926129,665,4,"But the psychopath Richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path."
3045,tt0926129,665,5,"The forgettable slash ""Prom Night"" is a collection of clich√©s with a total lack of originality."
3046,tt0926129,665,6,"The stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad acting of Johnathon Schaech in the role of an insane killer."
3047,tt0926129,665,7,The predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes.
3048,tt0926129,665,8,My vote is three.
3049,tt0926129,665,9,"Title Brazil: ""A Morte Convida Para Dan√ßar"" ""The Death Invites to Dance"""
3050,tt0926129,666,1,"I saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real, who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that, my girl friend turned to me and said ""we have to go see this movie""...enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and I tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren't even any of those."
3051,tt0926129,666,2,It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall.
3052,tt0926129,666,3,"I would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development."
3053,tt0926129,666,4,"The plot is just...well there was no plot it was basically I know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer, That's brilliant!"
3054,tt0926129,666,5,"hmmm The acting was what you expect in a Australian soap opera hopeless, that main character the Blondie god dam she annoyed me. her longest line must have been half a sentence, and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression."
3055,tt0926129,666,6,"Please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don't go see this, and if your like me and don't have a choice well then I wish you good luck, maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine."
3056,tt0926129,666,7,Can't believe this film got made!
3057,tt0926129,667,1,"When I first saw the trailer for Prom Night, I have to admit, the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie."
3058,tt0926129,667,2,"So my friend and I saw Prom Night last night and I have to say I must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film, not to mention I am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people."
3059,tt0926129,667,3,"There was no tension, the characters, how was I supposed to care about them."
3060,tt0926129,667,4,"They had no development what so ever, the killer.!"
3061,tt0926129,667,5,"Oh, my God, this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed, I know it's a film, but why would a man who neveror at least we know of killed any one before, kill a girl's family and friends that he's just obsessed over."
3062,tt0926129,667,6,"I mean, was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her."
3063,tt0926129,667,7,"I have no idea, because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror."
3064,tt0926129,667,8,"Donna's family was just brutally murdered by her teacher, who has become very obsessed over her, he was captured and put in jail."
3065,tt0926129,667,9,"It's been 3 years and she's just now getting some peace in her life, she's even going to her senior prom."
3066,tt0926129,667,10,"But the killer has escaped and still has Donna on his mind, he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends, and the hotel maid, and the bell boy, because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee's are."
3067,tt0926129,667,11,"Donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un noticed and can kill people so silently, just, wow."
3068,tt0926129,667,12,"I'm sorry, I really did want to love this movie, we haven't had a good slasher flick in a long time, but this was just a stupid movie that I was not impressed with."
3069,tt0926129,667,13,Just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious.
3070,tt0926129,667,14,"I know that this was a PG 13 movie, but I just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes."
3071,tt0926129,667,15,Not to mention no stab holes.
3072,tt0926129,667,16,"I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone unless you're a teen, this movie was made for the teenagers, not adults, and not for those who know a real horror movie, no offense to those who did enjoy this film, but I don't understand how anyone could.2/10"
3073,tt0926129,668,1,"So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie."
3074,tt0926129,668,2,"I'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but upon seeing it, it is neither horror or thriller."
3075,tt0926129,668,3,I was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable.
3076,tt0926129,668,4,You could predict what was going to happen next.
3077,tt0926129,668,5,"The young actors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game acting wise."
3078,tt0926129,668,6,"Yes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary."
3079,tt0926129,668,7,"There were almost zero ""jump in your seat"" scenes."
3080,tt0926129,668,8,"So, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to DVD."
3081,tt0926129,669,1,"I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but I just got back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinions."
3082,tt0926129,669,2,Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan.
3083,tt0926129,669,3,But what makes a horror movie.
3084,tt0926129,669,4,I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development.
3085,tt0926129,669,5,"I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn't even put forth ANY effort in that department."
3086,tt0926129,669,6,"Next, we all love suspense."
3087,tt0926129,669,7,That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises.
3088,tt0926129,669,8,"Yeah, Prom Night had none of that!"
3089,tt0926129,669,9,"Of course, we like a terrifying killer."
3090,tt0926129,669,10,Prom Night have that.
3091,tt0926129,669,11,"Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife."
3092,tt0926129,669,12,"And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene!"
3093,tt0926129,669,13,"Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG 13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too."
3094,tt0926129,669,14,"So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie."
3095,tt0926129,669,15,Nope.
3096,tt0926129,669,16,I'd call it more of a comedy.
3097,tt0926129,669,17,"People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw ""Semi Pro"" that was supposed to actually be a comedy which also sucked, but thats another story!."
3098,tt0926129,669,18,I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror.
3099,tt0926129,669,19,All the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money.
3100,tt0926129,669,20,The people I went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake!
3101,tt0926129,669,21,Which made me mad!
3102,tt0926129,669,22,I wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake...
3103,tt0926129,669,23,Where will horror go next...
3104,tt0926129,670,1,Prom Night is about a girl named Donna Brittany Snow who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night.
3105,tt0926129,670,2,"And by doing so killing her family, friends, and her enemies."
3106,tt0926129,670,3,Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG 13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately.
3107,tt0926129,670,4,Are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things.
3108,tt0926129,670,5,And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying.
3109,tt0926129,670,6,"And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian, Japanese, and Chinese films."
3110,tt0926129,670,7,That pretty much sums up Prom night but I'm still not done with the review.
3111,tt0926129,670,8,The only reason to see 'Prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills.
3112,tt0926129,670,9,"If not, don't see Prom night."
3113,tt0926129,670,10,You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall.
3114,tt0926129,670,11,And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7.
3115,tt0926129,670,12,So not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious.
3116,tt0926129,670,13,By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl.
3117,tt0926129,670,14,"Too much girl talk, too much guy talk, and lots of 'Oh my gosh."
3118,tt0926129,670,15,It's our prom'.
3119,tt0926129,670,16,I understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate.
3120,tt0926129,670,17,If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I'd be the first one too.
3121,tt0926129,670,18,I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick.
3122,tt0926129,670,19,"Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting, cheap scares, and a 'Night to die for' when watching the film.1 star out of 10."
3123,tt0926129,670,20,P.S.
3124,tt0926129,670,21,If I could give the film zero stars I would.
3125,tt0926129,671,1,"Poor acting, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no suspense, no original setups, it uses the same closet/under the bed/person behind you in the mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring, and NOT in a foreshadowing way either, and the fact that NOBODY ever ""really"" gets killed at least not on screen , which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve MORE cheated for spending money on their admission ticket....its a horror film w/o any horror LMAO."
3126,tt0926129,671,2,The MOST you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet.
3127,tt0926129,671,3,"You have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this, or you were high/drunk at the time."
3128,tt0926129,671,4,"Honestly, I have a life and don't bother writing reviews that often unless I really really hated something, or enjoyed it tremendously."
3129,tt0926129,671,5,But this film is AWFUL and I feel I have a duty of sorts to warn you NOT to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again!
3130,tt0926129,671,6,"It is one thing to rent a ""bad"" movie at blockbuster from the Weinsteins, its another when you have to sit through it in a theater."
3131,tt0926129,671,7,"Also, in case you want some remake nostalgia, forget it!"
3132,tt0926129,671,8,"This is NOT a remake, nor is it a re imagining."
3133,tt0926129,671,9,"It is not scary, nor engaging, nor is it satisfying enough to be ""funny"" like others on IMDb have claimed...it is just stale and booooring."
3134,tt0926129,671,10,"Here is what you will take away from this film: remembering the scar on Brittany Snow's head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech MUST be having some sexual affair with J.S."
3135,tt0926129,671,11,"Cardone of ""The Forsaken"" to have gotten another role as a killerbecause he is as frightening as my poodle, and too cute to kill just about anyone and that for some reason duh everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back."
3136,tt0926129,671,12,What kind of person would NOT get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesn't show up.
3137,tt0926129,671,13,This is my warning to you.
3138,tt0926129,671,14,DO NOT waste you're money like I did.
3139,tt0926129,671,15,"The ""original"" sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, though no way near as bad as this piece of crap sorry to sound vulgar or rude, but once you see this, you will understand why I say what I say."
3140,tt0926129,672,1,Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film.
3141,tt0926129,672,2,You know the one.
3142,tt0926129,672,3,"This October, Lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving insert disease name here to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex boyfriend."
3143,tt0926129,672,4,It's dramatic ¬Ö it's sappy ¬Ö it's immensely dull.
3144,tt0926129,672,5,"It does nothing to further a genre, tell an original story, or strive for ANY sort of newness."
3145,tt0926129,672,6,Prom Night shares this plight.
3146,tt0926129,672,7,"Watching the killer poke holes in his victims, we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled."
3147,tt0926129,672,8,It occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history.
3148,tt0926129,672,9,Our director is working with a fairly good looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier.
3149,tt0926129,672,10,Think about Matthew McConaughey coming at you with a knife.
3150,tt0926129,672,11,"You'd probably go ¬Ö ""OH!"
3151,tt0926129,672,12,Good lookin guy is going to kill me.
3152,tt0926129,672,13,"Naaaa."""
3153,tt0926129,672,14,"Not scary even for a second, so the director throws Schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror."
3154,tt0926129,672,15,This mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator.
3155,tt0926129,672,16,"You'll get 15 jump scares in this film, 2 of which made my date jump I might mention she is afraid of EVERYTHING."
3156,tt0926129,672,17,I'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me.
3157,tt0926129,672,18,"As if this film were not disjointed enough, it appears to be cut to shreds."
3158,tt0926129,672,19,"I'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film; I'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene, you often get a jarring jump."
3159,tt0926129,672,20,"This is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together, cross his fingers, and hope for the best."
3160,tt0926129,672,21,The editor should be shot.
3161,tt0926129,672,22,"With a plot you can pack into two sentences, one stray spray of blood, an emo killer, and the tension of a very special episode of ""Silver Spoons"", we're left with no reason to support horror this weekend ¬Ö at least on the big screen."
3162,tt0926129,672,23,"In fact, this is the sort of film that should be punished."
3163,tt0926129,672,24,Is it really that hard to make a scary movie.
3164,tt0926129,672,25,Was this crew even aware they were making a horror film..!!
3165,tt0926129,672,26,A complete waste of my time and yours.
3166,tt0926129,672,27,I bit the bullet to get you this review.
3167,tt0926129,672,28,Don't let my sacrifice be in vain.
3168,tt0926129,672,29,DON'T GO INTO THE MOVIE!!!
3169,tt0926129,673,1,...let me count the ways.1.
3170,tt0926129,673,2,A title only 'remake' that pulls out every clich√© in the slasher handbook.2.
3171,tt0926129,673,3,A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic.3.
3172,tt0926129,673,4,A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills.4.
3173,tt0926129,673,5,"A PG 13 rating that insures no gore, violence, or sex.5."
3174,tt0926129,673,6,A villain that is not frightening or even mysterious.6.
3175,tt0926129,673,7,A cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them.7.
3176,tt0926129,673,8,A lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere much unlike the original Prom Night.8.
3177,tt0926129,673,9,A script of dialog that's beyond poor it's mind numbing.
3178,tt0926129,673,10,9
3179,tt0926129,673,11,A series of cardboard performances not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that.10.
3180,tt0926129,673,12,A completely inept teen targeted slasher remake that's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination or even to show a puddle of blood.
3181,tt0926129,673,13,"It's a no brainer horror fans, save your money."
3182,tt0926129,673,14,BOMB out of
3183,tt0312528,9444,1,There's only one thing I'm going to say about cat in the hat...as a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...
3184,tt0312528,9444,2,I lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate.
3185,tt0312528,9444,3,Oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying...as for the plot I completely forgot.
3186,tt0312528,9444,4,Who cares it sucked anyway. i'm not sure why Mike Myers joined but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in Austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded but so what it was annoying. don't see it it belongs in the bottom 100.............................. the jokes are so unkiddy it's funny
3187,tt0312528,9445,1,Shame Shame Shame on UA/DW for what you do!
3188,tt0312528,9445,2,I was appalled.
3189,tt0312528,9445,3,Do NOT take kids to see this movie.
3190,tt0312528,9445,4,The humor is totally inappropriate for children plus they'll be bored and disappointed.
3191,tt0312528,9445,5,Certainly we all have read Theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash.
3192,tt0312528,9445,6,Dr.
3193,tt0312528,9445,7,"Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his ""thumbs up"" at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic."
3194,tt0312528,9445,8,What a pity.
3195,tt0312528,9445,9,Spend your money on the book.
3196,tt0312528,9445,10,"If you own a copy, then buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program."
3197,tt0312528,9445,11,"This movie is NOT worth a ""free"" ticket viewing."
3198,tt0312528,9445,12,Stick with the book.
3199,tt0312528,9445,13,The tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal save your money...seriously.
3200,tt0312528,9445,14,SAVE your money it will be on cable by saint patty's day.
3201,tt0312528,9445,15,Shame shame shame on what they do!!
3202,tt0312528,9446,1,An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book.
3203,tt0312528,9446,2,"Crude and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and a sickening side story about the mom's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book 3 8 yr olds."
3204,tt0312528,9446,3,"Don't waste your money, your time, or your good judgement."
3205,tt0312528,9447,1,"Most movies I can sit through easily, even if I do not particularly like the movie."
3206,tt0312528,9447,2,I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre.
3207,tt0312528,9447,3,This is the first movie I could not stand to watch.
3208,tt0312528,9447,4,Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies.
3209,tt0312528,9447,5,"The acting is okay Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is REALLY annoying."
3210,tt0312528,9447,6,"The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience."
3211,tt0312528,9447,7,"The plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue."
3212,tt0312528,9447,8,"The ""witty"" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny I remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a ""ho""."
3213,tt0312528,9447,9,"Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last FOREVER."
3214,tt0312528,9447,10,Do not waste your time.
3215,tt0312528,9447,11,I know small kids who hated this movie.
3216,tt0312528,9447,12,"If children can't stand it, I do not know how any adults can."
3217,tt0312528,9447,13,I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it.
3218,tt0312528,9447,14,I HATED IT!
3219,tt0312528,9447,15,"So, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this!"
3220,tt0312528,9447,16,See a GOOD movie!
3221,tt0312528,9447,17,1/10 stars the lowest review I have ever given a movie.
3222,tt0312528,9448,1,"No redeeming features, this film is rubbish."
3223,tt0312528,9448,2,Its jokes don't begin to be funny.
3224,tt0312528,9448,3,"The humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package."
3225,tt0312528,9448,4,Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next.
3226,tt0312528,9448,5,I couldn't enjoy the film at all.
3227,tt0312528,9448,6,"Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. which all get frequent requests for replays."
3228,tt0312528,9449,1,Dr.
3229,tt0312528,9449,2,Seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive.
3230,tt0312528,9449,3,Cat in the Hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop.
3231,tt0312528,9449,4,"We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, big mistake!"
3232,tt0312528,9449,5,Myers proves he can't act in this film.
3233,tt0312528,9449,6,He acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve.
3234,tt0312528,9449,7,"The kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying."
3235,tt0312528,9449,8,"The story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story!"
3236,tt0312528,9449,9,Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea.
3237,tt0312528,9449,10,He is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.
3238,tt0312528,9449,11,This movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it.
3239,tt0312528,9449,12,The film sure does look tacky!
3240,tt0312528,9449,13,"Sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, mildly funny."
3241,tt0312528,9449,14,"At least the Grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good!"
3242,tt0312528,9449,15,This film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting.
3243,tt0312528,9449,16,Was Mike Myers even in this movie actually.
3244,tt0312528,9449,17,"And another thing, the fish."
3245,tt0312528,9449,18,What is with that stupid fish!
3246,tt0312528,9449,19,"First time you see him, he's an actual fish."
3247,tt0312528,9449,20,"Next time you see him, he's all animated and talking."
3248,tt0312528,9449,21,But he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough!
3249,tt0312528,9449,22,This film is a total off target wreck.
3250,tt0312528,9449,23,"Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke!"
3251,tt0312528,9449,24,"I'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke, that was good."
3252,tt0312528,9449,25,"So please if you have the choice, watch the Grinch instead of this mess."
3253,tt0312528,9450,1,"Spend your time any other way, even housework is better than this movie."
3254,tt0312528,9450,2,"The jokes aren't funny, the fun rhymes that are Dr."
3255,tt0312528,9450,3,Seus aren't there.
3256,tt0312528,9450,4,A very lousy way to waste an evening.
3257,tt0312528,9450,5,My kids 4 16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play Barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net.
3258,tt0312528,9450,6,My wife left and did dishes.
3259,tt0312528,9450,7,So I finished it alone.
3260,tt0312528,9450,8,"It was the worst ""kids"" movie I have seen."
3261,tt0312528,9450,9,"If you want to watch a fun kids movie watch Shrek 2, that movie is fun for kids and their parents."
3262,tt0312528,9450,10,AVOID THIS MOVIE.
3263,tt0312528,9450,11,"It isn't funny, isn't cute, the cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label."
3264,tt0312528,9451,1,I've seen some bad things in my time.
3265,tt0312528,9451,2,A half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud; a head on collision between two cars; a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor; human beings living like animals.
3266,tt0312528,9451,3,But never in my life have I seen anything as bad as The Cat in the Hat.
3267,tt0312528,9451,4,"This film is worse than 911, worse than Hitler, worse than Vllad the Impaler, worse than people who put kittens in microwaves."
3268,tt0312528,9451,5,"It is the most disturbing film of all time, easy."
3269,tt0312528,9451,6,"I used to think it was a joke, some elaborate joke and that Mike Myers was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something."
3270,tt0312528,9451,7,I shudder
3271,tt0312528,9452,1,I was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production.
3272,tt0312528,9452,2,But it turned out to be the the biggest let down.
3273,tt0312528,9452,3,A far cry from the whimsical world of Dr Seuss.
3274,tt0312528,9452,4,It was vulgar and distasteful I don't think Dr Seuss would have approved.
3275,tt0312528,9452,5,How the Grinch stole Christmas was much better.
3276,tt0312528,9452,6,I understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on.
3277,tt0312528,9452,7,Whereas The Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than I would have liked.
3278,tt0312528,9452,8,Growing up with Dr Seuss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .
3279,tt0312528,9452,9,Lets see what they do with Horton hears a who.
3280,tt0312528,9452,10,I hope this one does Dr Seuss some justice.
3281,tt0312528,9453,1,"Holy cow, what a piece of sht this movie is."
3282,tt0312528,9453,2,I didn't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie.
3283,tt0312528,9453,3,I guess they didn't know either!
3284,tt0312528,9453,4,"I don't remember any farting or belching in the book, do you."
3285,tt0312528,9453,5,"They took this all times childrens classic, added some farting, belching and sexual inuindo, and prostituted it into a KAKA joke."
3286,tt0312528,9453,6,This should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like.
3287,tt0312528,9453,7,"I have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor if you even think that kind of thing is funny I DON'T want the kids that I know to think it is."
3288,tt0312528,9453,8,"Don't take your kids to see, don't rent the DVD."
3289,tt0312528,9453,9,I hope the ghost of Doctor Suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie.
3290,tt0312528,9454,1,"When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, I know it is bad."
3291,tt0312528,9454,2,I wanted to claw my eyes out.
3292,tt0312528,9454,3,I wanted to reach through the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had.
3293,tt0312528,9454,4,"This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to ""unwatch"", if only it were possible."
3294,tt0312528,9454,5,"The other films being 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both which are better than this crap in the hat."
3295,tt0312528,9454,6,I may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget I ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good Seuss name.
3296,tt0312528,9454,7,"To Mike Myers, I say stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World."
3297,tt0312528,9454,8,"Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, doesn't mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians."
3298,tt0312528,9455,1,Well I guess I know the answer to that question.
3299,tt0312528,9455,2,For the MONEY!
3300,tt0312528,9455,3,We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie.
3301,tt0312528,9455,4,"I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance."
3302,tt0312528,9455,5,Well I should have went with my instincts.
3303,tt0312528,9455,6,It was a complete piece Hollywood trash.
3304,tt0312528,9455,7,"Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good."
3305,tt0312528,9455,8,"Aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script."
3306,tt0312528,9455,9,"It's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries."
3307,tt0312528,9455,10,It jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction.
3308,tt0312528,9455,11,"This is then compounded with, ............................yes I'll say it, BAD ACTING!"
3309,tt0312528,9455,12,"I couldn't help but feel like I was watching ""Coffee Talk"" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth."
3310,tt0312528,9455,13,Was the Cat intended to be a middle aged Jewish woman.
3311,tt0312528,9455,14,"Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were no prize either, but Mr."
3312,tt0312528,9455,15,Myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another Austin Powers movie.
3313,tt0312528,9455,16,"F , no stars, 0 on a scale of 1 10."
3314,tt0312528,9455,17,Save your money!
3315,tt0312528,9456,1,"The sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies, that cold, cold, wet date day."""
3316,tt0312528,9456,2,"The Cat in the Hat"" was the name of the flick, and when it was over, my stomach was sick."
3317,tt0312528,9456,3,"Mike Myers played the Cat, his humor was lame, and kids needn't see this, the humor was not tame.the film was like drinking milk, from a rabid cow, so it IS fun to have fun, yet the filmmakers didn't know how."
3318,tt0312528,9456,4,"This film, in short is atrocious."
3319,tt0312528,9456,5,"The acting was bad, the plot was tweaked too much, and the humor was surprisingly very crude."
3320,tt0312528,9456,6,"It starts with Conrad and Sally, A rule breaker and a future sheriff."
3321,tt0312528,9456,7,"When their Mother has to go to work, she gets Mrs."
3322,tt0312528,9456,8,Kwan to babysit.
3323,tt0312528,9456,9,Possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when Mrs.
3324,tt0312528,9456,10,"Kwan is watching a Taiwanese court room, a `la C SPAN."
3325,tt0312528,9456,11,"She soon falls asleep, and here comes the Cat."
3326,tt0312528,9456,12,The film starts to spiral out of control.
3327,tt0312528,9456,13,The Cat came to try to let the kids have some fun.
3328,tt0312528,9456,14,"He's got Thing 1 and Thing 2, Who suddenly start trashing the house."
3329,tt0312528,9456,15,"He improvises a TV Infomercial, and accidentally slices his tail off."
3330,tt0312528,9456,16,"And when the Cat goes full Carmen Miranda, it's not funny."
3331,tt0312528,9456,17,Possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist.
3332,tt0312528,9456,18,And there's a fish who tries warning the kids about the Cat.
3333,tt0312528,9456,19,"Too bad he didn't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk, or chopping your tail off."
3334,tt0312528,9456,20,"Soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog, who has the key to a crate on his collar."
3335,tt0312528,9456,21,"If the crate is not locked soon, their house will be home to the Cat's universe."
3336,tt0312528,9456,22,"Here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film."
3337,tt0312528,9456,23,"The acting, overall, is horrible."
3338,tt0312528,9456,24,"Mike Meyers brings his brand of irreverent Austin Powers humor to the Cat, Saying things like ""You dirty ho"" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata."
3339,tt0312528,9456,25,"Spencer Breslin is great as the trouble making Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is cute as Sally, though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous Aortic Dissection waiting to kill John Ritteraccident waiting to happen."
3340,tt0312528,9456,26,"Alec Baldwin's slick and slimey Lawrence Quinn is disgusting, ever trying to woo the kids mom, who is played by Kelly Preston."
3341,tt0312528,9456,27,And Sean Hayes is Mr.
3342,tt0312528,9456,28,"Humberfloob, Mom's boss, and is also the voice of the fish."
3343,tt0312528,9456,29,The latter three are also bland.
3344,tt0312528,9456,30,"Overall, if I were a parent I would not take my kids who are into potty humor, cause there's plenty of it and more."
3345,tt0312528,9456,31,Save your $7.00 and see something else.
3346,tt0312528,9456,32,As the late great Dr.
3347,tt0312528,9456,33,"Seuss once said,It is fun to have fun, But you have to know how."
3348,tt0312528,9456,34,"Really, Universal, stop!"
3349,tt0312528,9456,35,Theodore's already turning over in his grave.
3350,tt0312528,9456,36,"Like my Mom always says, ""Curiousity killed the Cat""."
3351,tt0312528,9456,37,The Cat In The Hat  out of
3352,tt0312528,9457,1,"Just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong."
3353,tt0312528,9457,2,"Take Mike Myers, for example."
3354,tt0312528,9457,3,"He's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his SNL days, over ten years ago."
3355,tt0312528,9457,4,He's doing the same cutesy stream of consciousness jokes and the same voices.
3356,tt0312528,9457,5,His Cat is painfully unfunny.
3357,tt0312528,9457,6,He tries way to hard.
3358,tt0312528,9457,7,"He's some weird Type A comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be."
3359,tt0312528,9457,8,The rest of the movie is just as bad.
3360,tt0312528,9457,9,The sets are unbelievably ugly and clearly a waste of millions of dollars.
3361,tt0312528,9457,10,Cardboard cut outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street.
3362,tt0312528,9457,11,"Alec Balwin tries to do a funny Great Santini impression, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent."
3363,tt0312528,9457,12,There's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity Paris Hilton that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a Dr.
3364,tt0312528,9457,13,Seuss story.
3365,tt0312528,9457,14,"Avoid this movie at all costs, folks."
3366,tt0312528,9457,15,It's not even an interesting train wreck.
3367,tt0312528,9457,16,I hope they'll make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams.
3368,tt0312528,9457,17,Then we'll have the bad Seuss movie starring spasitc comedian trilogy.
3369,tt0312528,9458,1,"There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short."""
3370,tt0312528,9458,2,"The Grinch"" I thought was marvellous Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor in my opinion."
3371,tt0312528,9458,3,Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying.
3372,tt0312528,9458,4,"I used to like him very much in his ""Waynes World"" and ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" days but Ive never been fond of Austin Powers and ""the Cat In The Hat"" has just finished me off."
3373,tt0312528,9458,5,This film was horrible the gags were horrible!
3374,tt0312528,9458,6,inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 years!
3375,tt0312528,9458,7,"The plot was messy, messy, messy!"
3376,tt0312528,9458,8,"Its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was ""Mom""."
3377,tt0312528,9458,9,"They probably could have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for Myers ugly, revolting over acted portrayal of the Cat."
3378,tt0312528,9458,10,I mean did Myers even glance at a script.
3379,tt0312528,9458,11,Was one written.
3380,tt0312528,9458,12,The other actors seemed to have one but the Cat just seemed to be winging it!
3381,tt0312528,9458,13,On the other hand I would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous!!!
3382,tt0312528,9458,14,But unfortunately they cant save this film.
3383,tt0312528,9458,15,Poor Dr Seuss the man was a genius!
3384,tt0312528,9458,16,"Dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy, messy way!!!"

3389,tt0312528,9459,4,Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its...
3390,tt0312528,9459,5,#1 Movie in America!
3391,tt0312528,9459,6,What is this country thinking.
3392,tt0312528,9459,7,Mike Myers looking more like Micheal Jackson.
3393,tt0312528,9459,8,Some Chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes.
3394,tt0312528,9459,9,A lame plot with dirty jokes.
3395,tt0312528,9459,10,It's grotesuque and awful.
3396,tt0312528,9459,11,When Green Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005 I'll be so happy!
3397,tt0312528,9459,12,not Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green Eggs and Ham.
3398,tt0312528,9459,13,They'll try to chase Sam I Am and that mean guy who are running away with it.
3399,tt0312528,9459,14,I hope they don't ruin the classic book.
3400,tt0312528,9459,15,Don't waste time and money by seeing this.

3402,tt0312528,9460,2,When I think of Cat in the hat.
3403,tt0312528,9460,3,Im thinking of cat in the hat books.
3404,tt0312528,9460,4,"You know, the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children."
3405,tt0312528,9460,5,"Well, I though that this movie would be a lot like that!"
3406,tt0312528,9460,6,But much to my suprise was nothing like the books!
3407,tt0312528,9460,7,Insted it is more like young adult humor movie.
3408,tt0312528,9460,8,In one part cat is talking to a gardening tool hoe cat talks to it like it is his hoe agin adult humor. the naming of his car I all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie. under the rating you'll find: mild cude humor and some double entendres.
3409,tt0312528,9460,9,I think in short this means adult humor.
3410,tt0312528,9460,10,I wish I could return this movie!
3411,tt0312528,9460,11,wal mart said they wouldn't because the movie has been opened.
3412,tt0312528,9460,12,If you are thinking about buying this I suggest that maybe rent before you buy.
3413,tt0312528,9461,1,The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film.
3414,tt0312528,9461,2,Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is downright not funny and Mike Myers could not have been any worse.
3415,tt0312528,9461,3,This is his worst film he has ever been in.
3416,tt0312528,9461,4,The acting and the story was just terrible.
3417,tt0312528,9461,5,I mean how could they make the most beloved stories by Dr.
3418,tt0312528,9461,6,Seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all time and such a disappointment.
3419,tt0312528,9461,7,"I couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides, maybe Baby Geniuses."
3420,tt0312528,9461,8,But this film is just so bad I can't even describe how badly they made this film.
3421,tt0312528,9461,9,Bo Welch should be fired or the writer should.
3422,tt0312528,9461,10,Hedeen's outlook: 0/10 No Stars F
3423,tt0312528,9462,1,Inappropriate.
3424,tt0312528,9462,2,The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA.
3425,tt0312528,9462,3,Whale Rider gets a PG 13 but this movie gets a PG.
3426,tt0312528,9462,4,Please.
3427,tt0312528,9462,5,"Parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake."
3428,tt0312528,9462,6,"There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary."
3429,tt0312528,9462,7,"But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie."
3430,tt0312528,9462,8,The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces.
3431,tt0312528,9462,9,The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always likeable or hateable in this case Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles even though Preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this.
3432,tt0312528,9462,10,"The kids are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning."
3433,tt0312528,9462,11,Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen.
3434,tt0312528,9462,12,Did I mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie.
3435,tt0312528,9462,13,Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable.
3436,tt0312528,9462,14,"I didn't like him as the voice of Shrek, and I truly believe now that Myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again."
3437,tt0312528,9462,15,His portrayal of The Cat is a slightly toned down version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers.
3438,tt0312528,9462,16,"In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if just for a day, he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife."
3439,tt0312528,9462,17,The Cat in the Hat may be the worst kids movie ever.
3440,tt0312528,9463,1,"Mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever."
3441,tt0312528,9463,2,Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did but he should give up acting all together.
3442,tt0312528,9463,3,He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film.
3443,tt0312528,9463,4,The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor.
3444,tt0312528,9463,5,"I have seen a lot of bad film this year, but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made."
3445,tt0312528,9464,1,Well the previews looked funny and I usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because ......well you never know.
3446,tt0312528,9464,2,Here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults.
3447,tt0312528,9464,3,I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H  T spells.
3448,tt0312528,9464,4,Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr.
3449,tt0312528,9464,5,Seuss's classic.
3450,tt0312528,9464,6,It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money.
3451,tt0312528,9464,7,"If that was a subplot, then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and ""the cat"" plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is."
3452,tt0312528,9464,8,Take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie.
3453,tt0312528,9465,1,"From the acting, direction, scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims."
3454,tt0312528,9465,2,When did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention.
3455,tt0312528,9465,3,"Dr Suess is rolling in his grave right now, what with the ""dirty ho"" ""S.H.I.T"" and fake erection scenes etc etc etc."
3456,tt0312528,9465,4,"Its shameful how they trade on the name of Suess to get the parents to bring their kids, throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won't watch a a film with their child if there is no T & A."
3457,tt0312528,9465,5,Greed greed and more greed.
3458,tt0312528,9465,6,Compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into.
3459,tt0312528,9465,7,These guys should stick to making MTV videos.
3460,tt0312528,9465,8,How on earth this movie got >400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me. unless its the directors family
3461,tt0312528,9466,1,"This movie was physically painful to sit through, maybe because like many people my age, and younger I grew up with Dr."
3462,tt0312528,9466,2,"Seuss and loved his books funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time."
3463,tt0312528,9466,3,"""The Cat in the Hat"" sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story, and Mike Myer's performance as the Cat is mostly bewildering."
3464,tt0312528,9466,4,"Why the Borscht Belt accent, the unfunny patter, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume."
3465,tt0312528,9466,5,I had to go back and re read the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE.
3466,tt0312528,9466,6,"This movie is OVERBLOWN and way, way too long."
3467,tt0312528,9466,7,"You don't expect every kids' movie to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this one set a new low."
3468,tt0312528,9466,8,How could Mike Myers need the money.
3469,tt0312528,9467,1,"If you liked the Grinch movie... go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation."
3470,tt0312528,9467,2,"Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character to ""grace"" the screen in recent times."
3471,tt0312528,9467,3,"His voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater."
3472,tt0312528,9467,4,"Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now."
3473,tt0312528,9467,5,Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie.
3474,tt0312528,9468,1,The only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that I didn't have to pay for it.
3475,tt0312528,9468,2,I saw it for free at college.
3476,tt0312528,9468,3,"And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless."
3477,tt0312528,9468,4,"Stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent, yet bewildering set design that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles."
3478,tt0312528,9468,5,"I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie, but I have never seen anything more depressing."
3479,tt0312528,9468,6,"This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch which has its opponents, but I enjoyed it very much."
3480,tt0312528,9468,7,It's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it.
3481,tt0312528,9468,8,You want a funny Seuss adaptation.
3482,tt0312528,9468,9,Go with the Grinch.
3483,tt0312528,9469,1,"Audrey, I know you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed his wishes."
3484,tt0312528,9469,2,Dr.
3485,tt0312528,9469,3,Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason.
3486,tt0312528,9469,4,"We beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories, images, fantasies and characters."
3487,tt0312528,9469,5,They are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of Hollywood and Broadway.
3488,tt0312528,9469,6,The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books.
3489,tt0312528,9469,7,It is indeed your property to do with as you wish.
3490,tt0312528,9469,8,I just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while.
3491,tt0312528,9469,9,Save what is left of Dr.
3492,tt0312528,9469,10,Seuss.
3493,tt0312528,9469,11,Thank you.
3494,tt0312528,9470,1,"Film critics of the world, I apologize."
3495,tt0312528,9470,2,It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on.
3496,tt0312528,9470,3,But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt.
3497,tt0312528,9470,4,"However, my decision to see ""The Cat in the Hat"" wasn't made haphazardly."
3498,tt0312528,9470,5,"You see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the ""calamity"" known as ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""."
3499,tt0312528,9470,6,"Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat."
3500,tt0312528,9470,7,"So when the critics unleashed their fury against ""The Cat in the Hat"", another big budget Seuss update with a big name star in the title role, I thought that it must be the same old song."
3501,tt0312528,9470,8,How wrong I was.
3502,tt0312528,9470,9,For five whole minutes I thought I was in the clear.
3503,tt0312528,9470,10,"The opening credits are clever, the kids are charming and the production values are top notch."
3504,tt0312528,9470,11,Then the cat showed up.
3505,tt0312528,9470,12,"There are many problems from this point on, but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of Mike Myers."
3506,tt0312528,9470,13,"Where ""The Grinch"" was saved by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey, ""The Cat"" was destroyed by Myers."
3507,tt0312528,9470,14,"He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong, comic sketches."
3508,tt0312528,9470,15,"Every movie he's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch, from ""Wayne's World"" to ""Austin Powers""."
3509,tt0312528,9470,16,"So he tries to do the same thing here, it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of SNL, not funny, just painful."
3510,tt0312528,9470,17,Not that the writers helped him out any.
3511,tt0312528,9470,18,"After the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags, poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor."
3512,tt0312528,9470,19,This movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience I have ever had.
3513,tt0312528,9470,20,Period.
3514,tt0312528,9470,21,So much talent and work went into something so vile.
3515,tt0312528,9470,22,"I know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess, I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies."
3516,tt0312528,9470,23,"If you are a parent, please avoid this like the plague."
3517,tt0312528,9470,24,"With movies like ""Elf"" and ""Brother Bear"" currently in theaters, you have far better choices."
3518,tt0312528,9471,1,"Don't get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet."
3519,tt0312528,9471,2,The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going different story for a different time.
3520,tt0312528,9471,3,"As I began watching I noticed something, this film was terrible."
3521,tt0312528,9471,4,"Now there are two types of terrible, there's Freddy vs."
3522,tt0312528,9471,5,"Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this."
3523,tt0312528,9471,6,The Cat in The Hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me.
3524,tt0312528,9471,7,"As I watched the first bit of it not only was I bored senseless, but I felt as though I had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie."
3525,tt0312528,9471,8,"Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love the majority of his work, but something in this movie didn't click."
3526,tt0312528,9471,9,"One of the things that the director/producers/writers/whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book red, black, white on any character but the Cat."
3527,tt0312528,9471,10,"Coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any of the original and i hate to use this word, but it fits zaniness of the original."
3528,tt0312528,9471,11,"The book was like an Ice Cream Sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust."
3529,tt0312528,9471,12,Avoid this like a leprous prostitute.
3530,tt0312528,9472,1,"There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's get that part out of the way."
3531,tt0312528,9472,2,"First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film."
3532,tt0312528,9472,3,"Cat was... well, just awful."
3533,tt0312528,9472,4,"Jim Carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters."
3534,tt0312528,9472,5,Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.
3535,tt0312528,9472,6,"Why, why, why Mike Myers.."
3536,tt0312528,9472,7,"The kids could care less, and the Austin Powers demographic isn't going to spy this film."
3537,tt0312528,9472,8,"So, what was the studio thinking."
3538,tt0312528,9472,9,The Cat was also apparently related to Linda Richmond.
3539,tt0312528,9472,10,Can we talk.
3540,tt0312528,9472,11,Why a New York Accent.
3541,tt0312528,9472,12,Not entirely consistent with anything Dr.
3542,tt0312528,9472,13,Seuss has ever written.
3543,tt0312528,9472,14,Myers was even allowed to sneak in his Scottish shtick.
3544,tt0312528,9472,15,"I wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said ""as long as you don't say fahklempt', you can keep the accents."""
3545,tt0312528,9472,16,"Meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort, either with the costume, make up, or dialogue."
3546,tt0312528,9472,17,"The jokes, what few there were, were crude and age inappropriate."
3547,tt0312528,9472,18,"When Myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera: ""dirty ho"", everything but the rim shot was missing, and even that wouldn't have helped."
3548,tt0312528,9472,19,"The same folks who created 'Whoville', clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in 'Cat'."
3549,tt0312528,9472,20,"The sets and props were very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing, direction, and Myers."
3550,tt0312528,9472,21,There was some fun to be had with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston.
3551,tt0312528,9472,22,Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a Dr.
3552,tt0312528,9472,23,"Seuss classic, and stayed true to the genre."
3553,tt0312528,9472,24,Call the SPCA.
3554,tt0312528,9472,25,This Cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again.
3555,tt0312528,9472,26,"Please, please, no sequel."
3556,tt0367817,9300,1,Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is probably the worst film ever made.
3557,tt0367817,9300,2,Probably in the style of Ed Woodwithout the heart.
3558,tt0367817,9300,3,The lightning is terrible.
3559,tt0367817,9300,4,The music is very badpiano and orgue... come on!.
3560,tt0367817,9300,5,The acting is... well there is no acting!
3561,tt0367817,9300,6,There's a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger.
3562,tt0367817,9300,7,"The killer is a fat, unscary clown who couldn't outrun a turtle!"
3563,tt0367817,9300,8,Every members of the cast is stupid and the director put every clich√©s of slashers movies in the film without effort.
3564,tt0367817,9300,9,The end is so far the most stupid ever made.
3565,tt0367817,9300,10,Think about it: The guyken hebert who's acting skill is about the same as his writinghe's the brain behind this flop invite a co worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week end and kills them...
3566,tt0367817,9300,11,On monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen.
3567,tt0367817,9300,12,The tragedy is that Mr.
3568,tt0367817,9300,13,Hebert try to make us beleive that it's a family affair that goes on for generationhis uncle is the clown killerSo of course NO cops are gonna question him after his co worker goes missing...
3569,tt0367817,9300,14,WHATEVER.
3570,tt0367817,9301,1,Spoilers ahead if you want to call them that...
3571,tt0367817,9301,2,I would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a 1/10.
3572,tt0367817,9301,3,"Where to begin, we'll start from the top..."
3573,tt0367817,9301,4,"THE STORY: Don't believe the premise the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are."
3574,tt0367817,9301,5,"It's a draub, basic, go to cabin movie with no intensity or ""effort""."
3575,tt0367817,9301,6,"THE SCREENPLAY: I usually give credit to indie screenwriters, it's hard work when you are starting out...but this is crap."
3576,tt0367817,9301,7,The story is flat it leaves you emotionless the entire movie.
3577,tt0367817,9301,8,"The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of ""Woah, you totally freaked me out"" and ""I was wondering if you'd uh...if you'd like to..uh, would you come to the cabin with me.""."
3578,tt0367817,9301,9,"It makes me want to rip out all my hair, one strand at a time and feed it to myself."
3579,tt0367817,9301,10,THE CHARACTERS: HOLY CRAP!!!!
3580,tt0367817,9301,11,"Some have described the characters as flat, I want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch.."
3581,tt0367817,9301,12,They actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards...
3582,tt0367817,9301,13,THE ACTORS: Worse than the characters are the actors.
3583,tt0367817,9301,14,They take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting.
3584,tt0367817,9301,15,"The ""Woah you totally freaked me out"" was said so monotone and slow like it was dumbed down."
3585,tt0367817,9301,16,I could complain for hours on the actors alone.
3586,tt0367817,9301,17,TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: An eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie.
3587,tt0367817,9301,18,"Too shadowy in areas, too bleached in others."
3588,tt0367817,9301,19,The director shouldn't use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly.
3589,tt0367817,9301,20,Baby Steps!
3590,tt0367817,9301,21,SOUND: How many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie.
3591,tt0367817,9301,22,9
3592,tt0367817,9301,23,With that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured.
3593,tt0367817,9301,24,"There is one scene in particular that really sticks out, these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle...."
3594,tt0367817,9301,25,WEAK!
3595,tt0367817,9301,26,CAMERA: Learn to use it.
3596,tt0367817,9301,27,"Anyway, I'm running out of complaining space.....rent it I dare you..."
3597,tt0367817,9301,28,Rent it and learn from it...give it a 1 rating..it deserves it.
3598,tt0367817,9301,29,Signing off...
3599,tt0367817,9301,30,Amanda Christmas
3600,tt0367817,9302,1,This movie is just horrible.
3601,tt0367817,9302,2,"It's boring, it's low quality, the actors are just the worst actors I have ever seen and the scenario is so bad that it's hilarious."
3602,tt0367817,9302,3,"The ""main"" actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls, but he's ugly, overweight and looks like he's from the early 90's."
3603,tt0367817,9302,4,"All the characters are away for the week end for a get together amongst friends, but nobody are actually friends!"
3604,tt0367817,9302,5,"The married couple hasn't seen the ""main"" guy in over 5 years and even back then they weren't really friends."
3605,tt0367817,9302,6,"The ""date"" of the main guy only knows him from work and than there's a girl they pick up at a bar."
3606,tt0367817,9302,7,Now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a week end at your cabin with people that aren't even your real friends.
3607,tt0367817,9302,8,Because that's what he does at the beginning of the movie!
3608,tt0367817,9302,9,Do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon.
3609,tt0367817,9302,10,I've made home movies scarier than this!
3610,tt0367817,9303,1,I am writing this review having watched it several months ago....the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie.
3611,tt0367817,9303,2,It is a complete joke....and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art.
3612,tt0367817,9303,3,The producer who played Brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgers....hell he might not even be good at that either!
3613,tt0367817,9303,4,The lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you couldn't even see the actor's faces sometimes.
3614,tt0367817,9303,5,"I don't even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really, bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable."
3615,tt0367817,9303,6,That's all the time I will waste on this review PLEASE stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents don't do it buy s piece of gum at least IT would keep you entertained!
3616,tt0367817,9303,7,"If you want good quality low budget fun, far better than this... then check out a Jeff Hayes film....because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it!"
3617,tt0367817,9303,8,"I gave this 1 star just for the cover art....thats the only thing worth liking abut this so called ""film"" Rick Blalock"
3618,tt0367817,9304,1,"I have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life, a lot, but this is without a doubt the worst one ever!"
3619,tt0367817,9304,2,"I usually like dumb movies, if they are somewhat entertaining, but I can't even think of one good thing about this movie."
3620,tt0367817,9304,3,"I like ""Teen Witch"" for Heaven's sake."
3621,tt0367817,9304,4,"But S.I.C.K. has horrible acting, lame porn music throughout the whole thing, and even the sex scenes sucked!"
3622,tt0367817,9304,5,"I would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of ""Twin Dragons"", ""Puppet Master vs the Demonic Toys"" or even ""a Very Brady Sequel""."
3623,tt0367817,9304,6,"Although, this is by far worse then any of those."
3624,tt0367817,9304,7,"I beg you, don't even waste your time."
3625,tt0367817,9304,8,"Believe me, its 2 hours you'll never get back."
3626,tt0367817,9305,1,Me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good.
3627,tt0367817,9305,2,But we were wrong.
3628,tt0367817,9305,3,"First of the acting....wow...the acting was the worst, the effects were really bad as well, it seemed like a film a college kid made."
3629,tt0367817,9305,4,"The plot was pretty good, but it'd been done."
3630,tt0367817,9305,5,The thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors.
3631,tt0367817,9305,6,The main guy was the worst actor ever...it's a shame I'm even calling him an actor...
3632,tt0367817,9305,7,The only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny...so if you want a good laugh see it....but other than that...stay far away from this one.
3633,tt0367817,9305,8,"I usually love B list movies and such, but this one..."
3634,tt0367817,9305,9,I do not know how it was passed to even be put on video...this one is the worst I've seen..and I've seen some bad ones.
3635,tt0367817,9306,1,This film is the worst excuse for a motion picture I have EVER seen.
3636,tt0367817,9306,2,"To begin, I'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading, if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo wrong."
3637,tt0367817,9306,3,"In fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover, it's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool."
3638,tt0367817,9306,4,"Speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight..."
3639,tt0367817,9306,5,I mean seriously WTF...
3640,tt0367817,9306,6,How is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through.
3641,tt0367817,9306,7,"I bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining, if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right."
3642,tt0367817,9306,8,WRONG!
3643,tt0367817,9306,9,The next day I GAVE it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named S.I.C.KBottom line is: Don't SEE THIS FILM!!!
3644,tt0367817,9307,1,I rented this film about a month ago when I had nothing else to do on a Friday night.
3645,tt0367817,9307,2,"All I can say to describe this worthless film is 'TRASH' The acting is so badly done I've seen kids in high school do a better job The whole cast seems like they're just reading their lines out, no feeling, no emotion, and no room to capture the viewer."
3646,tt0367817,9307,3,On another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack.
3647,tt0367817,9307,4,The clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover.
3648,tt0367817,9307,5,Heck he doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters.
3649,tt0367817,9307,6,There is no real murder shown either so this isn't a real slasher film either Since I've seen it I've questioned a few things 1.
3650,tt0367817,9307,7,If is 'Serial Insane Clown Killer' Wouldn't that be a Serial Killer who kills clowns.
3651,tt0367817,9307,8,2
3652,tt0367817,9307,9,If your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her.
3653,tt0367817,9307,10,Sad really.3.
3654,tt0367817,9307,11,Why is it that the only REAL acting sputtered vainly out at the end all of a sudden.
3655,tt0367817,9307,12,Did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs.
3656,tt0367817,9307,13,This film is as sad as they come.
3657,tt0367817,9307,14,My advice is to avoid renting it lest you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming.
3658,tt0367817,9308,1,"this movie was definitely the worst movie i've seen in my entire life, and i've seen some pretty bad movies. i didn't like the way this movie was filmed. all of the actors are unknown, and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie. but it's absolutely horrible. i've never seen a worse movie. the story is so fake, and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie. there was no plot, it looked as though it wasn't planned out before they started filming. the story is too weird. i didn't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie. there was no point in even filming this movie. if you're considering watching this movie, don't. you're just wasting your time."
3659,tt0367817,9309,1,Hey everyone...
3660,tt0367817,9309,2,There really isn't much to say for this movie at all.
3661,tt0367817,9309,3,The basic plot is that a guy Brandon takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work.
3662,tt0367817,9309,4,"After picking up a girl on the way there, things start going badly wrong for all of them."
3663,tt0367817,9309,5,"The storyline alone written by the actor playing Brandon, I believe, although I could be wrong here is unlikely and unconvincing, and is acted out accordingly."
3664,tt0367817,9309,6,"The ""Clown Killer"" himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer."
3665,tt0367817,9309,7,"Far from being a dark, mysterious but most of all, intelligent predator, we are instead offered a rather clumsy, nursery rhyme singing buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis."
3666,tt0367817,9309,8,The only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things.
3667,tt0367817,9309,9,"In short, this film falls below every possible set standard."
3668,tt0367817,9309,10,"Admittedly, I was sharing a few beers with a close friend as I watched this, so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that S.I.C.K did fall just shy of a two rating."
3669,tt0367817,9309,11,"However, in reality, and with the benefit of hindsight the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film.1 star out of ten."
3670,tt0367817,9310,1,OK I ADORE this film...
3671,tt0367817,9310,2,I will credit this movie alone for making me such a die hard horror fanatic.
3672,tt0367817,9310,3,I could never watch this movie alone.
3673,tt0367817,9310,4,"I've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in it's original release at the theatres , on its viewers."
3674,tt0367817,9310,5,Incredible masterpiece....
3675,tt0367817,9310,6,"Horrible , psychological stuff scares the pants off me ."
3676,tt0367817,9310,7,"Oh bless their hearts, whoever made this awesome film."
3677,tt0367817,9310,8,I love it.
3678,tt0367817,9310,9,I thought the whole film was decent and interesting.
3679,tt0367817,9310,10,This movie is SO scary this is the scariest movie I have ever seen in my life!
3680,tt0367817,9310,11,"Not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough , but what always got me was Brendan's fabulous acting."
3681,tt0367817,9310,12,Best horror film EVER.
3682,tt0367817,9310,13,Nothing can ever be this scary again.
3683,tt0367817,9310,14,Halloween viewing at its evilest.
3684,tt0367817,9311,1,"The cover on the DVD and disc is freaking awesome, you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea, but this movie's actors are worst then Ben's performance in pearl harbor, porno's have better quality and better actors. i was gonna buy the DVD but luckily i rented it first, the plot and script are also horrible, nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense."
3685,tt0367817,9311,2,The poor attempts to frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in 80's sitcom shows and in the end it'll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house.
3686,tt0367817,9312,1,Worst movie on earth.
3687,tt0367817,9312,2,I don't even know where to begin but I hope I can save another person from punishing themselves with this movie.
3688,tt0367817,9312,3,"When it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is similar to a bad porno without the sex."
3689,tt0367817,9312,4,"The actors are some of the worst I've ever seen, and couldn't have been worse even if they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie."
3690,tt0367817,9312,5,The movie must have had a record breaking low budget which I'm sure was wasted almost solely on the movie's cover.
3691,tt0367817,9312,6,This movie has now become a running joke with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies.
3692,tt0367817,9312,7,I would like to point of that no other movie even begins to compare.
3693,tt0367817,9312,8,I feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and me watch this movie and am surprised she still considers me a friend after the torment I put us through.
3694,tt0367817,9312,9,Don't see this movie!
3695,tt0367817,9313,1,This was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen.
3696,tt0367817,9313,2,I am an open minded guy and i always love a good horror movie.
3697,tt0367817,9313,3,"In fact, when I'm renting movies i specifically look for some good underrated horror movies."
3698,tt0367817,9313,4,"They are always good for a laugh, believe i know, i have seen many."
3699,tt0367817,9313,5,But this movie was just so terrible it wasn't worth a chuckle.
3700,tt0367817,9313,6,I was considering turning it off in the first five minutes... which i probably should have.
3701,tt0367817,9313,7,"There is nothing good about it, first and foremost, the camera crew suck3d A$$."
3702,tt0367817,9313,8,The intro was stupid just like the ending.
3703,tt0367817,9313,9,Acting and special effects were terrible.
3704,tt0367817,9313,10,"Please I'm begging you, do NOT watch this movie, you will absolutely hate it."
3705,tt0367817,9314,1,"Well...overall, this movie was pretty much worthless, and it's basically a horror movie that ended up being more of a comedy."
3706,tt0367817,9314,2,I just rented this movie last night when me and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie.
3707,tt0367817,9314,3,"This definitely wasn't what we were looking for, but it satisfied us for humor."
3708,tt0367817,9314,4,The actors in this movie especially Brandon are so fake that it's funny.
3709,tt0367817,9314,5,And especially that Tracy girl whenever she's in the boarded up room telling the clown to go away.
3710,tt0367817,9314,6,They show almost no emotion and it's just so obvious that they're acting.
3711,tt0367817,9314,7,"And also when the clown is looking through that black box paper thing and grabs Mark, he doesn't even look like he's scared even though the clown like grabbed him and started attacking him."
3712,tt0367817,9314,8,"And seriously, would you just be JOGGING if you were being chased down."
3713,tt0367817,9314,9,I'd be sprinting for my life!
3714,tt0367817,9314,10,Even though anyone could probably outrun that clown because he's like 300 lbs.
3715,tt0367817,9314,11,"Not to mention that the effects aren't that great, like whenever the clown chops off Susan's head in the forest, then whenever he throws her head into the boarded up room with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise throws the head back over."
3716,tt0367817,9314,12,"Also like in the previous guy's comment, the beginning makes absolutely NO sense and I don't even see why it was even included in the movie."
3717,tt0367817,9314,13,"So what, was this movie made in 2003."
3718,tt0367817,9314,14,"The music made it sound like it was made in like the 1980's, and the camera ing. doesn't even really look professional."
3719,tt0367817,9314,15,"Half of the time, it seems like the camera can't even stay steady when it's suppose to be."
3720,tt0367817,9314,16,"Overall, I'd have to say I enjoyed the movie."
3721,tt0367817,9314,17,"I wouldn't recommend it though if you're trying to find something to scare you, but if you're looking for something to maybe make fun of or get a laugh out of, I'd recommend it for sure."
3722,tt0367817,9315,1,This movie was so bad!
3723,tt0367817,9315,2,It was terrible!
3724,tt0367817,9315,3,It was awful!
3725,tt0367817,9315,4,I cannot stress it enough!
3726,tt0367817,9315,5,"The acting, directing, story, characters and everything about it was bad!"
3727,tt0367817,9315,6,It was so corny and clich√©d.
3728,tt0367817,9315,7,"Don't be fooled by the cover, or the tag line ""The 'texas massacre' is nothing to laugh at."""
3729,tt0367817,9315,8,Are you frogging' kidding me!
3730,tt0367817,9315,9,It was ridiculous.
3731,tt0367817,9315,10,"The first 2 minutes of the film is good until it gets to the main character Brendan, OK now turn it off."
3732,tt0367817,9315,11,"What I got from the film was, A bunch of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sings nursery rhymes kills them in unoriginal and fake ways."
3733,tt0367817,9315,12,"This movie was a waste of my time and money, and it would be a waste of your money and time too!"
3734,tt0367817,9315,13,"I fast forward through most of the movie because it was so terrible, I just wanted to see how each bad actor died, and it STILL wasn't worth it!"
3735,tt0367817,9315,14,Just looking at the cover is a waste of time.
3736,tt0367817,9315,15,This IS seriously THE worst movie EVER!
3737,tt0367817,9315,16,Rating: doesn't deserve one.
3738,tt0367817,9316,1,"OK, so I rented this clown like Chainsaw Massacre esquire film, not expected much, but I did like the novel approach to a serial killer film. from the back of the box is the following synopsis ""At first, it was just a joke a myth around the campfire for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the Texas woods."
3739,tt0367817,9316,2,"But when they began to disappear one by one, replaced by scattered, bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies, the remaining few scramble for their lives."
3740,tt0367817,9316,3,But he's out there.
3741,tt0367817,9316,4,And he's sick.
3742,tt0367817,9316,5,"And all he wants is blood..."""
3743,tt0367817,9316,6,So obviously from the get go it doesn't make sense: why is this clown in the woods to begin with.
3744,tt0367817,9316,7,Why a clown.
3745,tt0367817,9316,8,"Why are their dolls with the word ""food"" drawn on them."
3746,tt0367817,9316,9,Why why why.
3747,tt0367817,9316,10,Hardly anything gets answered in this 1 hour 30 min. bore fest except where this clown lives.
3748,tt0367817,9316,11,"The characters are dumb guys, dumb girls, and a hell of a lot of bitchiness."
3749,tt0367817,9316,12,"One in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road, whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew."
3750,tt0367817,9316,13,What warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin.
3751,tt0367817,9316,14,"She, of course, begins planting seeds of jealousy, having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear."
3752,tt0367817,9316,15,The music was an average affair standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences.
3753,tt0367817,9316,16,The actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything.
3754,tt0367817,9316,17,"The idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date, but of course, she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him."
3755,tt0367817,9316,18,"There was hardly a budget spent of anything, it seems, but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap $1 store dolls lying around in the woods, which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie been done too many times."
3756,tt0367817,9316,19,"I was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film in through the glass maybe, but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film."
3757,tt0367817,9316,20,I guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something.
3758,tt0367817,9316,21,I had to give the film a 3.
3759,tt0367817,9316,22,"It was an interesting premise clown as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre character, essentially and I'll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could've totally been a B movie style video, but they opted for the more legitimate style of video."
3760,tt0367817,9316,23,"But ultimately, I probably would've felt like renting the Killer Klowns from Mars video again before going back to check this out."
3761,tt0367817,9316,24,"Ah, but that cover art...pretty awesome drawing."
3762,tt0367817,9317,1,I bought this from Blockbuster for 99p.
3763,tt0367817,9317,2,"The guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched to sht, but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a pss poor effort that sucked harder than Paris Hilton in a hotel room home video."
3764,tt0367817,9317,3,"Talking of home videos, since when has it been fair game to release them as films I mean to say, films used to employ actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on not any more just gather your friends and lame o ideas together for the weekend, lavish the production with an ¬£8.00 budget, and get someone to fall down the stairs with a Casio keyboard the soundtrack then slap it on the shelves, for some poor sap me, to take home in lonely desperation."
3765,tt0367817,9317,4,"But here's the clincher I fast forwarded through most of this, and tossed it to one side, ready for the hammers... until the next night, while watching a Darren Day horror 'Hellbreed' ¬£1.99 to take home and keep from a different Blockbuster."
3766,tt0367817,9317,5,"Now this film made 'Grim Weekend' look like The Exorcist, so I slapped Grim Weekend back on, to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful IMDb boards, that viewers claimed were hilarious."
3767,tt0367817,9317,6,"Sure enough, once I had got over the misery, the pain, and the horror, of realising Grim Weekend was utter chod on toast, I could enjoy, savour, and downright get down to the funny stuff."
3768,tt0367817,9317,7,And there's a lot of it.
3769,tt0367817,9317,8,Check the boards.
3770,tt0367817,9317,9,Then check the flick.
3771,tt0367817,9317,10,"Hell, it might even be worth it."
3772,tt0367817,9317,11,AWWWWW CRAP!
3773,tt0367817,9318,1,This is quite possibly THE worst movie I have ever seen.
3774,tt0367817,9318,2,"Again I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too After buying this and the movie ""Malevolence"" which I reviewed on here as well, I have learned my lesson."
3775,tt0367817,9318,3,I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm.
3776,tt0367817,9318,4,This supposedly takes place in the woods of Texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard.
3777,tt0367817,9318,5,The production was probably the worst I ever seen.
3778,tt0367817,9318,6,The actors were absolutely the WORST.
3779,tt0367817,9318,7,The story didn't have anything to do with what the back cover said.
3780,tt0367817,9318,8,"I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other ""mom and pop"" store that buys used DVDs and neither would take it."
3781,tt0367817,9318,9,Thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was.
3782,tt0367817,9318,10,I have seen some bad movies before Troll 2 for example but this definitely takes the cake.
3783,tt0367817,9318,11,"I didn't think there was a worse movie than ""Troll 2""."
3784,tt0367817,9318,12,Boy was I wrong!
3785,tt0367817,9318,13,Do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what I am about to do!!!!
3786,tt0367817,9319,1,"I don't know what you guys are talking about, the first time I watched this movie with two of my friends we couldn't stop crying."
3787,tt0367817,9319,2,This is one of the funniest shits I've ever seen.
3788,tt0367817,9319,3,That comment about the porn is so right though hahahaha.
3789,tt0367817,9319,4,"Yeah this movie actually is the worse, but it did bring tears to my eyes due to the phony characters, poor dialog and acting."
3790,tt0367817,9319,5,Not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it.!
3791,tt0367817,9319,6,It looks like one of those movies out of my drivers ed. class.
3792,tt0367817,9319,7,The props look like they came out of a high school drama show.
3793,tt0367817,9319,8,The music sounds like it is from an original Nintendo system game.
3794,tt0367817,9319,9,"The only thing that even came close the scaring me about this movie was that it had a killer clown which, who isn't creeped out by fat, lurking clowns. hahaha if someone were to ever watch this though, they need to look out for the actors verbal errors like lisping on words and some of their facial expressions. hahahaha I died."
3795,tt0367817,9319,10,SUSAN
3796,tt0367817,9320,1,"If this film was a comedy, I would have given it a 10."
3797,tt0367817,9320,2,"Oh my, where do I begin."
3798,tt0367817,9320,3,"Put it this way I've seen lots of terrible horror films, but this one makes Troll 2 look like freakin' Saving Private Ryan."
3799,tt0367817,9320,4,"It's as if a group of porn filmmakers decided to make a horror film, changed their mind in midproduction and decided to do a comedy, then went back to horror, and then decided that they should have just stuck with porno softcore at that."
3800,tt0367817,9320,5,"Everything about this film is simply terrible: the musical score someone shoot the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard, the script, the directing, the cinematography, the acting."
3801,tt0367817,9320,6,There simply are no words to describe this.
3802,tt0367817,9320,7,"Oh wait, yes there are: Holy $%!."
3803,tt0367817,9321,1,I rented this movie roughly 4 5 years ago and was instantly disappointed.
3804,tt0367817,9321,2,"I wanted to see a b movie slasher flick, but ended up with a fecal matter for my eyes."
3805,tt0367817,9321,3,The acting was similar to watching grass dry.
3806,tt0367817,9321,4,I've seen better acting in a softcore film...
3807,tt0367817,9321,5,The idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere baffled me.
3808,tt0367817,9321,6,"How was this a horror movie.this movie's production value, was laughable at best."
3809,tt0367817,9321,7,There were no scares.
3810,tt0367817,9321,8,It seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas.
3811,tt0367817,9321,9,"The plot was all over the place, if existent."
3812,tt0367817,9321,10,"If you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one."
3813,tt0367817,9321,11,There are much better b movies out there.
3814,tt0367817,9322,1,Please do not let the cover of this movie fool you.
3815,tt0367817,9322,2,And if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at: this isn't it.
3816,tt0367817,9322,3,"Usually I will go for stupid if it's funny, but this stupid was so stupid it almost or possibly did make me stupid."
3817,tt0367817,9322,4,"The film quality is better than a handheld, but not by much, and it's quite possible the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on a Casio keyboard."
3818,tt0367817,9322,5,"These problems should never really be a deterent from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing weep cast, and you have a real humdinger."
3819,tt0367817,9322,6,The story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in Texas for the weekend.
3820,tt0367817,9322,7,He also extends the invitation to his lady crush in his office.
3821,tt0367817,9322,8,"On the way there they meet a female in distress, who is then invited to come along by the other girls."
3822,tt0367817,9322,9,The stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house.
3823,tt0367817,9322,10,"From there you the audience and the morons, um, actors, try to figure out what's going on and they soon begin to distrust one another."
3824,tt0367817,9322,11,Overall I think I have made it sound better than it is.
3825,tt0367817,9322,12,"The main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot contrived, the acting bad and the motivations clueless."
3826,tt0367817,9322,13,"Once more this could be forgiveable it it was the least bit funny but alas, it is not."
3827,tt0367817,9322,14,The twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway.
3828,tt0367817,9322,15,Please don't let this review stop you from seeing the shear wonderment of this movie.
3829,tt0367817,9322,16,"Woah, my nose just grew eight inches."
3830,tt0367817,9323,1,What did I just watch.
3831,tt0367817,9323,2,I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen.
3832,tt0367817,9323,3,The concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing is there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns....but having it be a 300 pound nursery rhyme reciting killer clown makes a mockery of the genre.
3833,tt0367817,9323,4,"I still am wondering how the character Mark wasn't able to run away from the Clown...he's 300 pounds, he's gotta get tired eventually."
3834,tt0367817,9323,5,"The whole ending made me get up and literally say aloud ""What did I just watch."""
3835,tt0367817,9323,6,Apparently Brandon is Denise's cousin.... and they had got it on near the middle of the movie meaning he had sex with his cousin.....yeah that's something people want so see shudders.
3836,tt0367817,9323,7,"Another thing I found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says ""What did you do."""
3837,tt0367817,9323,8,"Well bytch, what do you think he just did."
3838,tt0367817,9323,9,The last thing that was stupidly funny was one second the main character was slapping the hitch hiker and calling her a cnt and then 5 minutes later saying violence isn't helping anything....did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong guy.
3839,tt0367817,9323,10,None of this movie makes sense anyway.
3840,tt0367817,9323,11,The movie was more or less a dumb low budget porno which I got sucked into buying all 3.99and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes.
3841,tt0367817,9323,12,"I'm surprised the fat clown didn't join the orgy, would have fit right in."
3842,tt0367817,9323,13,"I hoped the movie would have some entertainment value like other B movies might have, but I was wrong."
3843,tt0367817,9323,14,This is a moronic piece of garbage that's not even worth watching.1 out of 10
3844,tt0367817,9324,1,"OK i own this DVD i got it new at amazon... i mean i think its badass and a pretty cool flick and melissa bale the slutty/bitchy girl they pick up is hot as hell ..., the acting sucks and the whole polt just sucks the clown is some huge guy wearing a mask and its disgusting but its OK i wouldn't recommend it if like u wanted to rent a good entertaining flick after a hard days work but if u have nothing else to do and ur obbsessed with this stupid movies like i am, watch it sometime, and i do not know how artisan DVD has S.I.C.K. in its DVD collection , s.i.c.k. is not good enough to be owned by a half way decent movie company OK well thats all"
3845,tt0367817,9325,1,S.I.C.K. really stands for So Incredibly Crappy i Killed myself.
3846,tt0367817,9325,2,There was absolutely no acting to speak of.
3847,tt0367817,9325,3,The best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box.
3848,tt0367817,9325,4,The budgeting of this movie was sufficient.
3849,tt0367817,9325,5,The filming was sub sesame street.
3850,tt0367817,9325,6,The production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits.
3851,tt0367817,9325,7,The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store.
3852,tt0367817,9325,8,The ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh.
3853,tt0367817,9325,9,If there is a book out there for this movie I'm sure it's better.
3854,tt0367817,9325,10,I would avoid this at all costs.
3855,tt0367817,9325,11,I did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it. just kidding.
3856,tt0367817,9326,1,"Me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them, trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs."
3857,tt0367817,9326,2,S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror but funny movie we've rented.
3858,tt0367817,9326,3,"The plot is over done, the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old."
3859,tt0367817,9326,4,The goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat.
3860,tt0367817,9326,5,"And if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life, it's pathetic."
3861,tt0367817,9326,6,"The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie."
3862,tt0367817,9326,7,The other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry.
3863,tt0367817,9326,8,"I don't like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos, I don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth renting."
3864,tt0367817,9326,9,Unless you are too mature to laugh at someone's downfalls I would recommend it.
3865,tt0367817,9326,10,If your renting/buying it to laugh at it I'd give it an 8.5.
3866,tt0367817,9327,1,"This was, so far, the worst movie I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some REALLY bad movies."
3867,tt0367817,9327,2,"I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie."
3868,tt0367817,9327,3,Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie.
3869,tt0367817,9327,4,Where to start.
3870,tt0367817,9327,5,The filming of the movie was scattered and boring.
3871,tt0367817,9327,6,"At one point, there is a one minute scene of no one talking, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day."
3872,tt0367817,9327,7,"Nothing happened, they just drove in silence."
3873,tt0367817,9327,8,"The whole movie is boring, with annoying, unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of."
3874,tt0367817,9327,9,"If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy."
3875,tt0367817,9327,10,"Otherwise, when you see this movie, run."
3876,tt0367817,9328,1,Lucky me!
3877,tt0367817,9328,2,I got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shot in Texas 'horror' flick from Artisan Entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell you...
3878,tt0367817,9328,3,I've rarely laughed so hard in my life as I did watching this atrocious megabomb fly off the rails and steal the title of 'worst killer clown movie ever made' from the insufferably stupid Full Moon fiasco KILLJOY I'm sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one!
3879,tt0367817,9328,4,"From all indications, it was shot on DV, and it doesn't really 'look' all that bad quality wise for digital, but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it counts!"
3880,tt0367817,9328,5,The story slight and cliche as it is goes as follows...
3881,tt0367817,9328,6,"An executive Ken Hebert, who also scripted and co produced with the director takes skeptical co worker Tracy Amanda Watson and horny married couple Mark and Susan Hank Fields and Chris Buck along on a weekend getaway to a yawn secluded cabin `12 miles' from the nearest town."
3882,tt0367817,9328,7,"On the way there, they pick up a bitchy/slutty hitchhiker Melissa Bale in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanity yackin, pot smokin ¬ëfriends' disappears one by one, with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fates."
3883,tt0367817,9328,8,The killer clown doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box aside from being morbidly obese.
3884,tt0367817,9328,9,"It basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods, chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes."
3885,tt0367817,9328,10,"I cannot say enough bad things about the cast, especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick, who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times."
3886,tt0367817,9328,11,"Doesn't really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense, originality, intelligence, general coherence or humor."
3887,tt0367817,9328,12,"I could go on for days on how inept this film is, how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is, but I'll just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that Boy This Sucks kind of way."
3888,tt0367817,9328,13,Also noting that the film has been released here in the US as S.I.C.K.
3889,tt0367817,9328,14,SERIAL INSANE CLOWN KILLER.
3890,tt0367817,9328,15,It's currently catalogued under its original title of GRIM WEEKEND.Score: 1 out of 10
3891,tt0408309,4132,1,Feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other.
3892,tt0408309,4132,2,We haven't seen stuff like this since Godzilla v King Kong and the like.
3893,tt0408309,4132,3,Always sounds great on paper when you're splicing up and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing out before you like Beethoven's symphonies.
3894,tt0408309,4132,4,Then you come to writing it.
3895,tt0408309,4132,5,Great ideas like all vampires are female.
3896,tt0408309,4132,6,"Ergo hot, seductive deadly but in a way I want to perish sort of way."
3897,tt0408309,4132,7,And all zombies are men. well thats what men are like to a woman just after shes been dumped or cheated on right.
3898,tt0408309,4132,8,So it all looks good up to actually making it.
3899,tt0408309,4132,9,Then the rot starts to set in.
3900,tt0408309,4132,10,Mosters have fight.
3901,tt0408309,4132,11,Nothing much happens.
3902,tt0408309,4132,12,Another fight.
3903,tt0408309,4132,13,Philosophical noodling and cods wallop.
3904,tt0408309,4132,14,Eureka we've found how to win.
3905,tt0408309,4132,15,Big fight again and the End.
3906,tt0408309,4132,16,Sounds great doesn't it.
3907,tt0408309,4132,17,If it was made an indie company it would be great.
3908,tt0408309,4132,18,But this is Hollywood with the eye on the bucks: gloss instead of what the fans want.
3909,tt0408309,4132,19,It all could have been gore soaked beautiful.
3910,tt0408309,4133,1,"I watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago, I still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity."
3911,tt0408309,4133,2,The first few scenes alone were hilarious.
3912,tt0408309,4133,3,"I won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it, I wouldn't want to ruin the laughs."
3913,tt0408309,4133,4,Needless to say the entire time I watched this movie I was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing.
3914,tt0408309,4133,5,"Towards the end we all got bored however, as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off."
3915,tt0408309,4133,6,There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting.
3916,tt0408309,4133,7,"The characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten ""Learn to Read"" book."
3917,tt0408309,4133,8,They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting.
3918,tt0408309,4134,1,I honestly have to say that I could not stop watching this movie from the second that it started.
3919,tt0408309,4134,2,Simply for how bad it was!!!
3920,tt0408309,4134,3,It's kinda like watching paint dry only a lot more confusing.
3921,tt0408309,4134,4,"I mean you sit there and just wait for something to happen, anything in fact, preferably something that makes the whole film make sense!"
3922,tt0408309,4134,5,At the end of the film I actually sat there wondering if there was any chance at all that I may have missed the first hour that explained everything or whether I may have inadvertently passed out during the film and missed the parts that glued the plotif there was in fact onetogether!
3923,tt0408309,4134,6,"The main thing that really confused me about this movie, is nearly at the end the main girl if there was indeed a main girl was in some sort of alternate reality, i mean what the hell was going on at this point.!"
3924,tt0408309,4134,7,"all of a sudden she awoke and was in a mental institute, chained to a bed being drugged by doctors or something, then quicker than it would have taken me to slit my wrists, it flipped back and she was getting eaten out by some random vampire!"
3925,tt0408309,4134,8,it made no sodding sense!
3926,tt0408309,4134,9,"I'm tempted to email the makers and demand my time back, i mean i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this rubbish!"
3927,tt0408309,4134,10,i am kinda interested to know if the filmmakers themselves actually knew what it was all about!
3928,tt0408309,4134,11,just seemed someone had edited out all the bits that could have made it make sense though i think the film would have had to have been 4hrs long to make that happen!
3929,tt0408309,4134,12,"I side completely with the other person who wrote the other review, i was duped royally with this film by its title, and that alone."
3930,tt0408309,4134,13,"I'm just so sodding grateful i didn't actually buy the film, no matter how many times iv seen it in the local pound shop."
3931,tt0408309,4134,14,You would have thought that would have given me a clue that the film was a complete pile of steaming movie rubbish but to be honest I think ¬£1 was way too much money to spend on this film!!!!
3932,tt0408309,4134,15,"what a sodding huge waste of time and a good razor blade, i mean i wish i OD'ed, its less painful than watching this film!!!!"
3933,tt0408309,4135,1,This film was so bad i had to fast forward most of it to get to the good bits.
3934,tt0408309,4135,2,Hah what good bits. the only bit that was worth it was the ending those who have seen the film will know what i mean.
3935,tt0408309,4135,3,I expected a lot from this film like a underworld meets dawn of the dead meets Freddy vs.
3936,tt0408309,4135,4,Jason but what i got was this crap.
3937,tt0408309,4135,5,"Story was forgettable, the cast was used badly and what was the director thinking when he made this."
3938,tt0408309,4135,6,This could have been a great but i turned out to be the most boring film i have ever watched.
3939,tt0408309,4135,7,"OK so what if there was a nice bit of T and A, I was after the gore and i was bitterly disappointed."
3940,tt0408309,4135,8,Don't expect a film thats good but if you want a bad cheesy horror then by all means watch this and see how a horror movie SHOULDN'T BE DONE.
3941,tt0408309,4136,1,"I read the reviews before i watched this movie, and i didn't believe them."
3942,tt0408309,4136,2,I love crap movies and i expected this one to be average.
3943,tt0408309,4136,3,It wasn't.
3944,tt0408309,4136,4,This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like greats.
3945,tt0408309,4136,5,"The film contains bad acting, poor sound, poor confusing storyline, bad makeup and it bored me so much i turned it off. even the nudity was rubbish!"
3946,tt0408309,4136,6,Did they even have a budget for this film.
3947,tt0408309,4136,7,I don't think they did.
3948,tt0408309,4136,8,You can tell if your gonna like this film or not in the first 5 minutes. if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood.
3949,tt0408309,4136,9,"Avoid this trash I watched it on TV and felt riped off, so don't spend anything on it."
3950,tt0408309,4136,10,The best part is probably the end.
3951,tt0408309,4137,1,"I have a high tolerance level for crap, so I was looking forward to this."
3952,tt0408309,4137,2,It did not disappoint.
3953,tt0408309,4137,3,"Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carmilla, it follows a father and daughter hunting a female vampire who, luckily, happens to be travelling with them."
3954,tt0408309,4137,4,"Then we have Santa Claus or the General, as he likes to be called here running over random zombies."
3955,tt0408309,4137,5,Did I mention there was a zombie outbreak.
3956,tt0408309,4137,6,The dead are returning to life but nobody seems too concerned.
3957,tt0408309,4137,7,"We have construction worker zombies, soldier zombies and even St."
3958,tt0408309,4137,8,Trinian schoolgirl zombies.
3959,tt0408309,4137,9,Apparently Santa Claus is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire.
3960,tt0408309,4137,10,"Oh wait there are no vampires, the girl is in a lunatic asylum and Carmilla is her nurse, or is she."
3961,tt0408309,4137,11,The zombies are back and Santa's mad.
3962,tt0408309,4137,12,"Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I like zombies but I especially like lesbian sex."
3963,tt0408309,4137,13,Nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to get the juices flowing.
3964,tt0408309,4137,14,When are we going to see vampires fight zombies.
3965,tt0408309,4137,15,Is she a vampire or is she a lunatic.
3966,tt0408309,4137,16,Or both.
3967,tt0408309,4137,17,Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse.
3968,tt0408309,4137,18,"More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus."
3969,tt0408309,4137,19,Here come the St.
3970,tt0408309,4137,20,Trinian zombies.
3971,tt0408309,4137,21,Chainsaw time!!
3972,tt0408309,4137,22,More lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires.
3973,tt0408309,4137,23,"I guess the zombies won, or did they."
3974,tt0408309,4137,24,Plot.
3975,tt0408309,4137,25,Who needs a plot when you've got lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies.
3976,tt0408309,4137,26,And cunnilingus.
3977,tt0408309,4138,1,"I though this would be an okay movie, since i like zombies and horror movies in general."
3978,tt0408309,4138,2,But i did not think it would be such a piece of sh!
3979,tt0408309,4138,3,t like it was.
3980,tt0408309,4138,4,The only zombie in the movie is at the beginning and he gets ran over by a god damn car!!!
3981,tt0408309,4138,5,"The movie looks to be written by a porn director and filled by porn actors, i wouldn't ever call them actors!"
3982,tt0408309,4138,6,The costumes seems to be stolen from a local school play.
3983,tt0408309,4138,7,Its seems like a road movie with almost no monsters.
3984,tt0408309,4138,8,There is no fun at all in this piece of sh!
3985,tt0408309,4138,9,"t, only horror, but not in the way the director intended."
3986,tt0408309,4138,10,I would rather be raped by a pedophile than see this movie ever again!!!
3987,tt0408309,4138,11,ugh!
3988,tt0408309,4139,1,"OK, look at the title of this film.the title says it all right. the title is great... i mean, a lot of things should come into your head after readin it. in fact, you might be extremely anxious to see it.well, sadly, you won't see any of that.just a bunch of bad actors, some blood spilling, some hot chicks, and some lesbo action.oh, well, i think there are about 5 10 minutes of zombies and vampires indeed...get away from this if you want to see a good movie. else get it."
3989,tt0408309,4140,1,"As you may or may not have heard, there is no actual fighting between vampires or zombies in this film."
3990,tt0408309,4140,2,"One may then ask why the title suggested such a thing, but really it's kind of appropriate because nothing else about this film made any sense either."
3991,tt0408309,4140,3,"There was absolutely no story or plot, just things happening."
3992,tt0408309,4140,4,"The acting was incredibly bad, worse than safeauto commercials bad."
3993,tt0408309,4140,5,Not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies but I think there was only one scene with zombies even in it.
3994,tt0408309,4140,6,Their make up looked as if it were applied by an 8 year old girl.
3995,tt0408309,4140,7,The scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer I'm not kidding but they used chainsaw sound effects.
3996,tt0408309,4140,8,This was undoubtedly the poorest movie I've ever seen in my life.
3997,tt0408309,4140,9,The only circumstance that I wouldn't totally ridicule every person responsible for production of this film is if I learned that it was produced entirely by 11 year old's.
3998,tt0408309,4140,10,"Really though, even with all of the criticism I offer here, I'd suggest watching this movie solely based on the fact that it may very well be the worst movie ever, and because of this is quite comical."
3999,tt0408309,4140,11,Even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained.
4000,tt0408309,4141,1,Well...the movie was a fun watch.
4001,tt0408309,4141,2,The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by.
4002,tt0408309,4141,3,Like vampires that walk in the sunlight.
4003,tt0408309,4141,4,Though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies.
4004,tt0408309,4141,5,"A scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams ""Ow this hurts..."
4005,tt0408309,4141,6,"It's really stuck."""
4006,tt0408309,4141,7,Then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while.
4007,tt0408309,4141,8,And there are random dream sequenes' that really don't help with the plot.
4008,tt0408309,4141,9,"Come to think of it, nothing really made sense, but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect."
4009,tt0408309,4141,10,"Come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful, and the zombies were just fun to watch."
4010,tt0408309,4141,11,Slowly as i write more of this I like this movie more.
4011,tt0408309,4141,12,"But you know, all in all you can't expect Schindlers List but its a fun watch."
4012,tt0408309,4142,1,This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen!!
4013,tt0408309,4142,2,There was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie.
4014,tt0408309,4142,3,I have seen some bad movies but this one takes it.
4015,tt0408309,4142,4,There is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you can't seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it.
4016,tt0408309,4142,5,I feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half.
4017,tt0408309,4142,6,Please take my advice and DO NOT WATCH this movie for I know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life.
4018,tt0408309,4143,1,As myself and my other half are big fans of trash horror we couldn't resist getting out a movie that contained both of the greats we were thrilled!
4019,tt0408309,4143,2,However for a 2004 movie with a rip off cover of Freddy Vs Jason this is a disgrace!
4020,tt0408309,4143,3,The worst film I have ever seen but worth a look for a laugh if you are able to sit through it!
4021,tt0408309,4143,4,"The acting is awful the effects...well I could do better on my camcorder in fact its so bad they only bothered to put make up on the zombies faces and left out neck, hands etc."
4022,tt0408309,4143,5,"No story line, weird flashbacks that make no sense and terrible script!"""
4023,tt0408309,4143,6,"you broke my tooth!"""
4024,tt0408309,4143,7,"from one vampire ""you broke my cigar"" was the response from the human who looked like uncle Jessie from Dukes crossed with Santa!"
4025,tt0408309,4144,1,Vampires Vs.
4026,tt0408309,4144,2,Zombies starts with the breaking news that the unidentified disease that is spreading across America leaves the sufferer with homicidal & cannibalistic tendencies...
4027,tt0408309,4144,3,Travis Fontaine C.S.
4028,tt0408309,4144,4,Munro & his teenage daughter Jenna Bonny Giroux listen to the radio as they drive along the isolated backwoods roads to try & escape the disease when Travis runs over a guy who I assume is meant to be a zombie.
4029,tt0408309,4144,5,"Slightly further down the road he stops to help Julia Brinke Stevens & her teenage daughter Carmilla Maratama Carlson who are waving at the side of the road, at this point there is also a third teenage girl named Tessa Melanie Crystal sitting in the back of Julia's car bound & gagged."
4030,tt0408309,4144,6,"To me this situation would seem strange but Travis, like the trooper he is, takes it all in his stride & agrees to 'take' Carmilla off Julia's hands &, well I don't know actually."
4031,tt0408309,4144,7,"So, with a complete stranger, Travis drives off leaving Julia & Tessa."
4032,tt0408309,4144,8,"Carmilla seems like a nice girl but she turns out to be a Vampire & she likes to bite people & turn them into Vampires, oh & she's partial to a bit of lesbianism too."
4033,tt0408309,4144,9,"Travis, Carmilla & Jenna continue to travel while some guy who calls himself The General Peter Ruginis who appears to be some sort of Vampire killer & probably has something to do with it all but the film is such a mess it doesn't really matter & I really don't know how to carry on this plot outline as my head hurts just thinking about it..."
4034,tt0408309,4144,10,"Co edited, co executive produced, written & directed by the supremely untalented Vince D'Amato Vampires Vs."
4035,tt0408309,4144,11,Zombies is one of the worst horror films ever & therefore one of the worst films ever period.
4036,tt0408309,4144,12,"The script by D'Amato was apparently based on a classic story entitled 'Carmilla' by Sheridan Le Fanu he should sue & is an absolute mess, the holes in the plot & logic are so big you could drive a tank through them!"
4037,tt0408309,4144,13,What is the disease that turns people into zombies.
4038,tt0408309,4144,14,Why is Carmilla a Vampire.
4039,tt0408309,4144,15,Who is Julia to her.
4040,tt0408309,4144,16,Who the hell is The General.
4041,tt0408309,4144,17,What does he want.
4042,tt0408309,4144,18,Where are Travis & Jenna going.
4043,tt0408309,4144,19,How can Travis run a man over & yet not have the slightest bit of human emotion over it.
4044,tt0408309,4144,20,What's with the mental ward at the end.
4045,tt0408309,4144,21,There are also some confusing & unnecessary dream sequences just to annoy the viewer even more.
4046,tt0408309,4144,22,"There are just so many things wrong with this film, the narrative doesn't make a blind bit of sense, the concept is terrible & never really explained properly plus it's incredibly boring."
4047,tt0408309,4144,23,I have not one positive thing to say about Vampire Vs.
4048,tt0408309,4144,24,"Zombies, not one."
4049,tt0408309,4144,25,"Forget about any Vampires fighting Zombies because it just doesn't happen, tell me again why is this film called Vampires Vs."
4050,tt0408309,4144,26,Zombies.
4051,tt0408309,4144,27,"Director D'Amato has served up one of the most incompetent, rubbishy, badly made, poorly thought out & excruciatingly painful viewing experiences ever made."
4052,tt0408309,4144,28,Vampires Vs.
4053,tt0408309,4144,29,"Zombies really has no redeeming qualities at all, there is not one single aspect that I can praise."
4054,tt0408309,4144,30,"The gore is really fake looking, there are some blood splats which look like red water, some really cheap staking effects & a half decent climax where the zombies feast on Carmilla's & Jenna's intestines, this fairly gory scene is probably the best part of the whole wretched film but it only lasts for a couple of minutes & in no way makes up for the other turgid 85."
4055,tt0408309,4144,31,The budget on Vampires Vs.
4056,tt0408309,4144,32,"Zombies must have been small, in fact did it even have a budget because most of it is set on a road in a couple of cars."
4057,tt0408309,4144,33,"This is one of the most badly made horror films it's been my misfortune to watch, the entire thing just sucks."
4058,tt0408309,4144,34,"The acting is predictably awful, & I mean awful."
4059,tt0408309,4144,35,"There isn't much else left to say, Vampires Vs."
4060,tt0408309,4144,36,Zombies is easily one of the worst films ever made.
4061,tt0408309,4144,37,The V next to the title on the IMDb's main page for Vampires Vs.
4062,tt0408309,4144,38,"Zoimbies indicates that it went straight to video, well that's far too good for this pile of crap as it deserves to go straight on the nearest fire."
4063,tt0408309,4145,1,"Okay, I've watched this movie twice now, I have researched it heavily on the net, I have asked several people on there opinions."
4064,tt0408309,4145,2,"I have even gone to the length of reading the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla', a book that this movie is supposed to be based on."
4065,tt0408309,4145,3,I feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it.
4066,tt0408309,4145,4,"As the plot of the movie doesn't seem to make any sense at all, here is the plot of the book."
4067,tt0408309,4145,5,"Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her Father, Mr De Lafontaine."
4068,tt0408309,4145,6,They carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully.
4069,tt0408309,4145,7,One day they get a letter from the 'General' a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death.
4070,tt0408309,4145,8,"He makes claims of supernatural powers being at work, and explains that he will visit them soon."
4071,tt0408309,4145,9,"Meanwhile, a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the Lafontaines looking after her Daughter, Carmilla, for several months."
4072,tt0408309,4145,10,"Soon Laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams, and begins to come down with a strange illness."
4073,tt0408309,4145,11,Who is this mysterious Carmilla.
4074,tt0408309,4145,12,"And just what has she to do with Laura's condition, and the General."
4075,tt0408309,4145,13,"I have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it, and let me know what their results are."
4076,tt0408309,4145,14,"I even have a catchy name, and would have a jingle too, but I can't be bothered with that."
4077,tt0408309,4145,15,"It's called the ""this movie doesn't make any sense"" game."
4078,tt0408309,4145,16,"All you have to do is, whilst watching the movie, try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening."
4079,tt0408309,4145,17,"I mean complete, all questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete."
4080,tt0408309,4145,18,It will have to answer such questions as ...
4081,tt0408309,4145,19,Why can vampires walk around in day light.
4082,tt0408309,4145,20,Why are they all lesbians.
4083,tt0408309,4145,21,Why is a girl called Bob. and why does she shoot herself.
4084,tt0408309,4145,22,When is the movie a dream and when is it real.
4085,tt0408309,4145,23,Why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn't make anyone bat an eyelid.
4086,tt0408309,4145,24,"Why does Travis Fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car, yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car, accept the excuse that she is a zombie too."
4087,tt0408309,4145,25,"And why does he then let a girl, which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire, drive with him in his car."
4088,tt0408309,4145,26,"And then let her drive off, alone with his daughter in a stolen car."
4089,tt0408309,4145,27,What the hell is the asylum scene all about.
4090,tt0408309,4145,28,What the hell is the green goo all about.
4091,tt0408309,4145,29,Why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse.
4092,tt0408309,4145,30,Why are there never any vampires fighting Zombies.
4093,tt0408309,4145,31,What is the significance of the necklace. what is it made of. why does it kill vampires. and how does Jenna know that.
4094,tt0408309,4145,32,"In fact sod it, it's just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too."
4095,tt0408309,4145,33,"I have my plot, and I have to admit it is not quite there, but it is a pretty good effort."
4096,tt0408309,4145,34,In Conclusion'Vampires vs Zombies' has no moment in it where there are actually Vampires fighting Zombies.
4097,tt0408309,4145,35,"Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on, yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this."
4098,tt0408309,4145,36,And somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel.
4099,tt0408309,4145,37,How.
4100,tt0408309,4145,38,Why.
4101,tt0408309,4145,39,What the hell is going on.
4102,tt0408309,4146,1,"After watching this thing, then reading the summary on the back of the DVD, then thinking back to actual movie...."
4103,tt0408309,4146,2,I became a bit dizzy.
4104,tt0408309,4146,3,"I thought, maybe I fell asleep and dreamed I was a down syndrome baby waltzing through a never ending forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no purpose other then occasional tasteless lesbianism."
4105,tt0408309,4146,4,Where zombies. come out of nowhere and vampires. who seduce. pure hearted citizens on their way to save the world.
4106,tt0408309,4146,5,Neither zombie nor vampire notably encounter each other.
4107,tt0408309,4146,6,The only fighting i remember was getting that walrus Bonny Giroux's panties off.
4108,tt0408309,4146,7,Coo Coo ca FAT!
4109,tt0408309,4146,8,All of them!
4110,tt0408309,4146,9,"Maybe that was because we were watching it widescreen stretched and were too lazy to change it to its native resolution, but that actually made it more entertaining..."
4111,tt0408309,4146,10,"In conclusion my trailing thought thesis had more continuity, plot, character development, antagonism, subject matter, and acting then the entirety of this film."
4112,tt0408309,4146,11,It made Bloodrayne look like Citizen FING KANE
4113,tt0408309,4147,1,"I am an avid fan of horrendous movies, anything cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game."
4114,tt0408309,4147,2,"So imagine my spirit I went to the local Rent Shop, and found Vampires vs."
4115,tt0408309,4147,3,Zombies.
4116,tt0408309,4147,4,"The name is just too entertaining, you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it, it just has to be bad."
4117,tt0408309,4147,5,"And boy, is it BAD."
4118,tt0408309,4147,6,"After viewing this horror ific movie, I was speechless, literally."
4119,tt0408309,4147,7,"Me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie."
4120,tt0408309,4147,8,"I broke the depressing silence with the words, ""...dude...."
4121,tt0408309,4147,9,"What."""
4122,tt0408309,4147,10,"Yes, i am an enthralling individual."
4123,tt0408309,4147,11,"Heres a quick 'street review' The Plot; There is none, at all, ever, constantly in ""WTF"" mode."
4124,tt0408309,4147,12,"The Characters; No development, forgettable."
4125,tt0408309,4147,13,The Music; Worse than porn.
4126,tt0408309,4147,14,The Vampires; Theirs vampires.
4127,tt0408309,4147,15,The Zombies; Theirs Zombies.
4128,tt0408309,4147,16,"In the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, its so bad I yearn to see it again."
4129,tt0408309,4147,17,"So do yourself a favor, watch it and get Depressed."
4130,tt0408309,4148,1,I picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie.
4131,tt0408309,4148,2,But I had no Idea what I was getting myself into.
4132,tt0408309,4148,3,I started the movie and soon I had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture.
4133,tt0408309,4148,4,I finally know what hell is like.
4134,tt0408309,4148,5,It's this movie.
4135,tt0408309,4148,6,For eternity.
4136,tt0408309,4148,7,This movie has no value.
4137,tt0408309,4148,8,It didn't even really have a plot.
4138,tt0408309,4148,9,There was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens.
4139,tt0408309,4148,10,Instead of watching this movie I suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can.
4140,tt0408309,4148,11,You will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie.
4141,tt0408309,4148,12,Don't even watch it.
4142,tt0408309,4148,13,Not even to see how bad it is.
4143,tt0408309,4148,14,I beg you.
4144,tt0408309,4148,15,"If you watch it, then it means they win."
4145,tt0408309,4149,1,Dear me.
4146,tt0408309,4149,2,Where do I start.
4147,tt0408309,4149,3,The dad isn't anywhere near old enough to be the girl's dad.
4148,tt0408309,4149,4,He corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the film.
4149,tt0408309,4149,5,"The favoured exclamation in this film is ""Jesus Christ!!!""."
4150,tt0408309,4149,6,"Zombies are agile, stupid and few and far between."
4151,tt0408309,4149,7,Motives are utterly incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist.
4152,tt0408309,4149,8,People 'rush' to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 MPH.
4153,tt0408309,4149,9,The world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are supposed to be the end days.
4154,tt0408309,4149,10,Breasts appear for the sake of breasts.
4155,tt0408309,4149,11,Normally such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or the future of humanity.
4156,tt0408309,4149,12,"There's a dog for no reason and thin, orange blood that turns the stomach."
4157,tt0408309,4149,13,"The General and his catchphrase of ""Shut the fk up!"""
4158,tt0408309,4149,14,is the only redeeming feature.
4159,tt0408309,4149,15,"As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves."
4160,tt0408309,4150,1,Oh it really really is.
4161,tt0408309,4150,2,"I've seen films that I disliked more, due to whatever reason, but never have I seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making."
4162,tt0408309,4150,3,"It even fails to fail at film making, in a Way the Hercules in New York could be said to do."
4163,tt0408309,4150,4,"It's not the film I like the least, but it is the very worst film I've ever seen."
4164,tt0408309,4150,5,The acting is the first thing that strikes you.
4165,tt0408309,4150,6,I've never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography.
4166,tt0408309,4150,7,In fact I've plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this.
4167,tt0408309,4150,8,It really is awful.
4168,tt0408309,4150,9,"Technically, it's terrible."
4169,tt0408309,4150,10,The camera work is amateurish.
4170,tt0408309,4150,11,The editing is nonsensical.
4171,tt0408309,4150,12,"I presume they couldn't afford proper sound equipment, and this meant that every scene in a car and there's a lot of them has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods and there's a lot of them too is actually dubbed from a studio, again lending more to the bad porn vibe."
4172,tt0408309,4150,13,"The plot is nonsensical, as many have pointed out."
4173,tt0408309,4150,14,"I'll defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by Nosferatu, this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythos."
4174,tt0408309,4150,15,"Speaking of vampire mythos, the writer had evidently read Carmilla, or at very least seen The Vampire Lovers."
4175,tt0408309,4150,16,"I'm not sure how I feel about this, swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a Gothic novel I'm very fond of; or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material."
4176,tt0408309,4150,17,At very least 'the General' is an insult to Peter Cushing though.
4177,tt0408309,4150,18,"It gets two stars however, merely because I can't bring myself to vote one star for a film that has, or at least purports to have, both vampires and zombies in it."
4178,tt0408309,4150,19,"Incidentally I watched Lifeforce another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it on the same day as this, and despite being a rather flawed film itself, really comes out a masterpiece compared to this."
4179,tt0408309,4150,20,"So in the end, this is not a film so bad it's good, or so bad it's in any way enjoyable, even drunk."
4180,tt0408309,4150,21,"It's just a mess, and worth no one's time watching."
4181,tt0408309,4151,1,This is probably the best horror film made since Ed Wood died.
4182,tt0408309,4151,2,"I can't spoil the ending, because I have absolutely no idea what happened."
4183,tt0408309,4151,3,"I'll try my best, though."
4184,tt0408309,4151,4,"There are some kind of lesbian vampires, but they keep swapping bodies, so any character might or might not be the character you're supposed to think it is, or it might be a lesbian vampire."
4185,tt0408309,4151,5,Sound confusing.
4186,tt0408309,4151,6,"It's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with."
4187,tt0408309,4151,7,"There's no plot, no character development, and random people show up, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard from again."
4188,tt0408309,4151,8,"There are also zombies, who are possibly the enemies of the vampires, but there's also a dream within a dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital, so maybe none of this actually happened, and it's all the main character's hallucination."
4189,tt0408309,4151,9,The upside.
4190,tt0408309,4151,10,Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly.
4191,tt0408309,4151,11,"The special effects are simply mind boggling I particularly liked the incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences."
4192,tt0408309,4151,12,"Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity."
4193,tt0408309,4151,13,Well worth the price of rental.
4194,tt0408309,4151,14,We laughed until we cried.
4195,tt0408309,4152,1,"First off I must stress how rare it is that I take the time to comment on a movie that I have seen, it takes a very special case for me to take the time and write about how I felt about a film."
4196,tt0408309,4152,2,"That said, of the hundreds of movies I have watched I have seen some of the most brilliant, Shawshank, the scariest, The Woman in Black, the funniest, Shark Attack III: Megaladon, and now the worst: Vampires vs."
4197,tt0408309,4152,3,Zombies.
4198,tt0408309,4152,4,The first thing that must be said is that this movie is not funny!
4199,tt0408309,4152,5,"For those that are looking for a light hearted movie that will just be fun or at the very least so bad that it's funny, look elsewhere."
4200,tt0408309,4152,6,"It is true that a movie such as this is not trying to be subtle and brilliant, with a title such as this you should know what you're getting into."
4201,tt0408309,4152,7,"That said, there is no excuse for a movie to abandon any and every rule that governs the movie making world."
4202,tt0408309,4152,8,"This is not an argument between the traditional movie making process and newer and more ""artsy"" methods to creating a film, this is an argument between bad directors and companies being held accountable for making terrible movies."
4203,tt0408309,4152,9,"This movie suffers from the over used saying ""I don't know where to start."""
4204,tt0408309,4152,10,Truly everything about this movie is broken.
4205,tt0408309,4152,11,From the acting and to the editing there is no reason any movie should ever fail to deliver a cohesive series of events such as Vampires vs.
4206,tt0408309,4152,12,Zombies.
4207,tt0408309,4152,13,Some of the following problems are; 1.
4208,tt0408309,4152,14,"Scene misfires It's clear that the director, the camera crew and the actors were not on the same page."
4209,tt0408309,4152,15,In one scene in particular the scene begins with the camera resting on the ground looking at the passenger side door of a car.
4210,tt0408309,4152,16,"You are expecting the person inside to get out, but there is a, and this is NO exaggeration, 10 second, at least, delay between the camera comes on and the director says ""action"" to where anything happens on screen."
4211,tt0408309,4152,17,"The viewer is left staring at a car door for the entire time with no sound, no movement, just the stereotypical ""dead air"" that radio or TV commentators dread."
4212,tt0408309,4152,18,Where was the editing.
4213,tt0408309,4152,19,2
4214,tt0408309,4152,20,"Acting A forgivable offense in most cases, you can't expect a movie like this to have Oscar winners after all, but Vampires vs."
4215,tt0408309,4152,21,Zombies takes bad acting to a whole other level.
4216,tt0408309,4152,22,"These ""actors"" were barely able to read their scripts obviously because anyone with any ability to read and to speak would have been able to pronounce the lines better than these fools."
4217,tt0408309,4152,23,My only comparison for acting would have to be the opening scene from Resident Evil on Playstation.
4218,tt0408309,4152,24,"But that acting was even better.3 Story Wait, what."
4219,tt0408309,4152,25,Story.
4220,tt0408309,4152,26,"Again you can't expect this to be The Greatest Story Ever Told, but is it too much to ask that we have some semblance of a narrative."
4221,tt0408309,4152,27,Why the Vampires.
4222,tt0408309,4152,28,Who are the characters.
4223,tt0408309,4152,29,Who are the bad guys.
4224,tt0408309,4152,30,Are there good guys.
4225,tt0408309,4152,31,Why all the lesbians.
4226,tt0408309,4152,32,"But most importantly, what's the deal with the zombies."
4227,tt0408309,4152,33,"If you have seen this movie then you will understand what I mean, but to those who haven't I'll be plain, there are no zombies in this movie aside from maybe five minutes of it."
4228,tt0408309,4152,34,It was almost as if the director forgot about the name of the movie and was forced to throw some zombies in without explanation at the very end.
4229,tt0408309,4152,35,"There's so much more, but I hope I've done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie."
4230,tt0408309,4153,1,I really have no idea how to comment on this movie.
4231,tt0408309,4153,2,"The special effects were lackluster, the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all, it was on the back of the box."
4232,tt0408309,4153,3,"I don't think I can remember a movie being THIS bad in a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies!!"
4233,tt0408309,4153,4,; Even that couldn't save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand or lay in this case in front of a camera.
4234,tt0408309,4153,5,"I was pretty much let down by the overall ""zombie"" effect."
4235,tt0408309,4153,6,"Since apparently in this movie, zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there, and casually talking about it at a gas station one with an in house windshield repair but no interior bathroom, the zombie movie genre isn't even a factor until the end."
4236,tt0408309,4153,7,"Even then, a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girl's clothes doesn't really constitute being a zombie movie."
4237,tt0408309,4153,8,"On to the vampires: Apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female, which is OK by me."
4238,tt0408309,4153,9,"I'm not sure how vampires are out in the daylight, or the why/how of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road, still holding his gun with a stake through his heart, just waiting for the Queen of the Vampires to flick it all the way through."
4239,tt0408309,4153,10,"The last segment in the old nunnery made no sense, and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire ""Do you think we did the right thing."" by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie, that about put it over the top."
4240,tt0408309,4153,11,The acting and special effects were at an all time low also.
4241,tt0408309,4153,12,You could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the General.
4242,tt0408309,4153,13,"Speaking of the General, where did they find THIS Kenny Rogers look alike anyways."
4243,tt0408309,4153,14,"No idea what he was the General of, aside of generally confusing and misplaced."
4244,tt0408309,4153,15,"All in all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste $3."
4245,tt0408309,4153,16,Just my $0.02.
4246,tt0408309,4154,1,Vampires Vs.
4247,tt0408309,4154,2,Zombies wasn't the original title.
4248,tt0408309,4154,3,It was actually...
4249,tt0408309,4154,4,"Nasty Lesbian Semi Vampires and Two Zombies Getting Hit by Cars: Special Guest appearances by Bob the Lesbian Gypsie Witch and her dog, Random Woman with special powers and the Catholic School Girl Short Skirt Zombie Choir."
4250,tt0408309,4154,5,"Also on the Box: Warning: No Plot only the writer and director will understand the end, or anything else in this movie."
4251,tt0408309,4154,6,"Seriously though, I love bad movies."
4252,tt0408309,4154,7,I love Vampires.
4253,tt0408309,4154,8,I love Zombies.
4254,tt0408309,4154,9,"Hell, I even enjoy the lesbians."
4255,tt0408309,4154,10,"This movie combined all three with a vague and confusing or non existent plot, horrendous I mean REALLY BAD dialogue, and random STUFF and PEOPLE that have nothing to do with anything or do they..."
4256,tt0408309,4154,11,I didn't know what in the world was going on.
4257,tt0408309,4154,12,"Oh, and I can't forget the green oatmeal 'Zombies' in latex gloves yes, the film makers were so cheap they couldn't even cover their Zombies hands in oatmeal and paint."
4258,tt0408309,4154,13,"Any way, the result was this excruciatingly BAD film, if you could even call it that."
4259,tt0408309,4154,14,Was the end supposed to not make sense.
4260,tt0408309,4154,15,The Vampire was really Nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient.
4261,tt0408309,4154,16,Where were the Vampires Vs.
4262,tt0408309,4154,17,Zombies.
4263,tt0408309,4154,18,"Hell, where were the Vampires at all... you really couldn't call any of the girls vampires."
4264,tt0408309,4154,19,Whatever.
4265,tt0408309,4154,20,Don't ever rent or buy this movie.
4266,tt0408309,4154,21,"If you are REALLY curious... okay, I'll understand."
4267,tt0408309,4154,22,"Seriously, even lovers of BAD movies won't be able to stand this one."
4268,tt0408309,4154,23,It should be number 1 on the bottom 100.
4269,tt0408309,4155,1,"OK, I knew this would be a back alley F film well below B film standards going into it, so I thought, ""Man, I could use a good laugh, so let's see some nether beings kill each other."""
4270,tt0408309,4155,2,"Well, what I got could have been found at your local ""love toy"" store."
4271,tt0408309,4155,3,"Random lesbian scenes, very little fighting, and no plot."
4272,tt0408309,4155,4,"For example, one scene in particular I remember for its sheer stupidity only; I've seen better porn on ABC is where the two main characters I can't remember their names offhand...great movie, huh. are driving along, as they mostly did, and the driver was tired of driving and stopped:Driver: ""Let's pull over, I'm tired."
4273,tt0408309,4155,5,"You want to take over."""
4274,tt0408309,4155,6,"Passenger: ""Sure, I can drive for a while."""
4275,tt0408309,4155,7,"Once pulled over, the driver starts grabbing the passenger's boobs Passenger: ""What are you doing."
4276,tt0408309,4155,8,"I'm not like that!"""
4277,tt0408309,4155,9,"Driver: ""It's OK, everyone does it sometime."""
4278,tt0408309,4155,10,"Passenger: ""OK then."""
4279,tt0408309,4155,11,"Proceed to take off shirts, fondle, kiss, and perform fellatioNow, last time I checked, horror films were not in the porn section of Hollywood Video unless you're into S&M, then you go elsewhere, and it definitely shouldn't be in the mainstream videos at Blockbuster."
4280,tt0408309,4155,12,"Don't get me wrong; I'm definitely not one of those people who hate porn, but I only watch it when appropriate and definitely don't want to watch it if I'm looking for a movie in the mainstream stores, as this one I rented was at one of the two retailers I named and probably at the other too if I went and looked."
4281,tt0408309,4155,13,"Worst movie ever, no one should rent it, and it should only be bought for a public burning ceremony."
4282,tt0408309,4155,14,"If I could give it a 0, I would, but I can only give it a  of 10."
4283,tt0408309,4156,1,"Yes, this movie is bad."
4284,tt0408309,4156,2,What's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title!!
4285,tt0408309,4156,3,"In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE."
4286,tt0408309,4156,4,"On top of that, we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire."
4287,tt0408309,4156,5,"One might argue they were trying to ""tone it down"" or make it ""realistic,"" but it ends up just boring."
4288,tt0408309,4156,6,More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR.
4289,tt0408309,4156,7,"The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either."
4290,tt0408309,4156,8,"Also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie."
4291,tt0408309,4156,9,"However, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere."
4292,tt0408309,4156,10,"I'm all for independent films, but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience if any. ""worse than Scarecrow slayer."""
4293,tt0408309,4157,1,"The above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my suicidal underlings decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit Erotic,Scary, Suspenseful, Well thought out, these are all the things this film fails to be."
4294,tt0408309,4157,2,"It is however incredibly funny, the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies I have seen in recent years."
4295,tt0408309,4157,3,"And yet this film doesn't even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements, it becomes a comedy without even attempting to amuse."
4296,tt0408309,4157,4,Throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like Santa Claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground.
4297,tt0408309,4157,5,"This made me fail to believe the films title, if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting."
4298,tt0408309,4157,6,"Oh well whatever, besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title."
4299,tt0408309,4157,7,Such as this one; there has been a virus sweeping through America creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist.
4300,tt0408309,4157,8,And yet there's only four zombies in the entire film.
4301,tt0408309,4157,9,Another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted.
4302,tt0408309,4157,10,Surely you'd see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit.
4303,tt0408309,4157,11,"In fact I believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they didn't have a high enough budget to film in a wider location, that or the director didn't want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters."
4304,tt0408309,4157,12,In fact the director had so much fun doing this that he didn't have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor.
4305,tt0408309,4157,13,"And so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous, whilst I assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels ""editing isn't a hard job anyway right."""
4306,tt0408309,4157,14,"The only reason this ""movie"" found it's way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with Freddy vs Jason, strange how these things happen isn't it."
4307,tt0408309,4157,15,And the only way we made it though the night was by strapping gas masks on and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess.
4308,tt0408309,4157,16,"Oh yes we did laugh at the end, but I'm sure one does that a lot when he has lost his sanity..................."
4309,tt0408309,4158,1,This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen!!!!
4310,tt0408309,4158,2,I can honestly say I have never seen a movie worse than this one!!!
4311,tt0408309,4158,3,AND I MEAN NEVER!!!!
4312,tt0408309,4158,4,"I'm a BIG fan of ""B"" horror movies."
4313,tt0408309,4158,5,As you may imagine....
4314,tt0408309,4158,6,I've been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offer.
4315,tt0408309,4158,7,I was lured to this movie by it's title.
4316,tt0408309,4158,8,"I mean c'mon... what true fan of horror wouldn't be intrigued by a title like ""Vampires vs."
4317,tt0408309,4158,9,"Zombies""..."
4318,tt0408309,4158,10,"Images of the ""undead"" battling each other to the ""undeath"" danced in my head."
4319,tt0408309,4158,11,"I thought to myself... ""this I've got to see""!!!!"
4320,tt0408309,4158,12,"Well.... sorry to say.... ""this I wish I hadn't seen""!!!!!"
4321,tt0408309,4158,13,This movies title is very misleading to say the least.
4322,tt0408309,4158,14,There was no vampires fighting zombies.
4323,tt0408309,4158,15,"In fact, there is no plot!!!!"
4324,tt0408309,4158,16,If you were to ask me what this movie is all about I could honestly tell you I have no idea!!!
4325,tt0408309,4158,17,There was no plot!!!!
4326,tt0408309,4158,18,There was no story!!!!
4327,tt0408309,4158,19,This movie absolutely makes no sense at all!!!!
4328,tt0408309,4158,20,At the end of this debacle...
4329,tt0408309,4158,21,I found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business sense!!!
4330,tt0408309,4159,1,"In this strangely lackadaisical apocalypse, the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too worried about it in this Grade Z film which bares less resemblance to Sheridan Le Fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna recipe."
4331,tt0408309,4159,2,Bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it.
4332,tt0408309,4159,3,"The plot, and I use that term loosely, involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with ""the general,"" whose daughter is missing, at a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, happens to be traveling with the father and daughter."
4333,tt0408309,4159,4,I must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor.
4334,tt0408309,4159,5,The film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested.
4335,tt0408309,4159,6,Anyone older beware.
4336,tt0408309,4160,1,This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.
4337,tt0408309,4160,2,I watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot.
4338,tt0408309,4160,3,"Aside from the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the ""special effects"" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible."
4339,tt0408309,4160,4,The movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny.
4340,tt0408309,4160,5,You can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue.
4341,tt0408309,4160,6,"I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about."
4342,tt0408309,4160,7,It's now a running joke among my friends and I. 1 out of 10.
4343,tt0493424,7366,1,What the F@# was this I just watched.
4344,tt0493424,7366,2,Steven STOP!!
4345,tt0493424,7366,3,Please!
4346,tt0493424,7366,4,This movie is insatiably bad and silly.
4347,tt0493424,7366,5,"In a bizarre departure from action and adventure, Mr."
4348,tt0493424,7366,6,Seagal is now fighting obviously wish they were vampire 'like' creatures with super human strength..
4349,tt0493424,7366,7,OK.
4350,tt0493424,7366,8,"Oh, and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way."
4351,tt0493424,7366,9,Wow!
4352,tt0493424,7366,10,"Even still in this movie however, to quell Seagals have to have the last punch and no one can kick my a$$ ego, HE is somehow stronger than they are."
4353,tt0493424,7366,11,However all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him.
4354,tt0493424,7366,12,"Come on, I can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer, but these are super human strength people."
4355,tt0493424,7366,13,"Oh and get this, Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues, because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is Wolverine!"
4356,tt0493424,7366,14,Oh My GO...
4357,tt0493424,7366,15,And worst than all of that!
4358,tt0493424,7366,16,"Yes, there is a worse than that."
4359,tt0493424,7366,17,He has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face.
4360,tt0493424,7366,18,They obviously sound nothing like him and I believe it may be one of the other actors in the film.
4361,tt0493424,7366,19,It was pure madness.
4362,tt0493424,7366,20,Although I wanted to turn it off I always watch a movie to he end.
4363,tt0493424,7366,21,This is an all time low even for your direct to video movies Steven.
4364,tt0493424,7366,22,Awful!
4365,tt0493424,7366,23,Awful!
4366,tt0493424,7366,24,Awful!
4367,tt0493424,7366,25,Two thumbs down!
4368,tt0493424,7366,26,Redemeption qualities.
4369,tt0493424,7366,27,"Well I guess so, I will be fair in that aspect."
4370,tt0493424,7366,28,"At least some of the special effects were OK, and I like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses."
4371,tt0493424,7366,29,The women all were quite attractive IMO.
4372,tt0493424,7366,30,"Still, and I said STILL, it does not make up for the blatant X Men, Underworld, insert your favorite zombie, vampire movie here rip off!"
4373,tt0493424,7366,31,"The director, writer, producer, ALL should be bansihed & exile from the movie business."
4374,tt0493424,7366,32,I think I feel the way that most people feel about Blood Rayne and just about all other Uwe Boll pictures about this film.
4375,tt0493424,7366,33,That's my whole $1.00 on this film.
4376,tt0493424,7366,34,View if you dare.
4377,tt0493424,7367,1,I am truly beginning to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his films could become.
4378,tt0493424,7367,2,This particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to see.
4379,tt0493424,7367,3,My first complaint was the cover of the DVD where they have doctored his pic and made him look slimmer and younger when in the film he looks like crap.
4380,tt0493424,7367,4,He has his big pot belly and double chin going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face.
4381,tt0493424,7367,5,The whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too long.
4382,tt0493424,7367,6,The whole film was leading up to the finale where Seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer.
4383,tt0493424,7367,7,There was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of Seagals voice even in the middle of a statement.
4384,tt0493424,7367,8,The dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical.
4385,tt0493424,7367,9,The fight scenes in the film were horrible.
4386,tt0493424,7367,10,Half the time when Seagal fought you could not even see what was going on.
4387,tt0493424,7367,11,There would be tight shots of him flapping his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something.
4388,tt0493424,7367,12,It was reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television.
4389,tt0493424,7367,13,They used way too much slow motion for the fight scenes.
4390,tt0493424,7367,14,I believe this is Seagals worst film to date and I am glad I did not purchase this film or I would have been very upset since I am a huge fan of Seagal the Aikidoist.
4391,tt0493424,7367,15,The action star is quickly fading away and seems to be getting worse with every performance.
4392,tt0493424,7368,1,I had the misfortune of wasting 10 quid buying SS new movie on DVD: Attack Force.
4393,tt0493424,7368,2,Now i usually can suspend my belief watching films like this.
4394,tt0493424,7368,3,A pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the sofa watching a noisy late evening shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha male like me.
4395,tt0493424,7368,4,I bought this film thinking I'd see cool martial arts and shoot em up.
4396,tt0493424,7368,5,Did i hell.
4397,tt0493424,7368,6,"Segal is old and bloated, the plot was ludicrous even by SS standards and to cap it all off Segal's acting such as it was to start with is exceptionally dire."
4398,tt0493424,7368,7,So dire in fact that half of his voice was dubbed over by a man who sounded NOTHING LIKE HIM.
4399,tt0493424,7368,8,Either SS cant act no more a moot point of the crew were so dreadful at their jobs they couldn't record the sound properly.
4400,tt0493424,7368,9,The voice would flick back and forth between Mr Whisper Segal and the man who does voice overs for Honda adverts!
4401,tt0493424,7368,10,"Plot wise isn't the issue because most action films work along the same premise as this one, nothing new there."
4402,tt0493424,7368,11,The usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to get blown away.
4403,tt0493424,7368,12,Avoid this film like you would avoid walking in front of a speeding train or a dose of H5N1 avian flu.
4404,tt0493424,7368,13,Utter garbage.1/10This has been a public health warning.
4405,tt0493424,7369,1,"I had a feeling that after ""Submerged"", this one wouldn't be any better..."
4406,tt0493424,7369,2,I was right.
4407,tt0493424,7369,3,"He must be looking for champagne money, and not care about the final product... his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him; the editing is well just a grade above amateurish."
4408,tt0493424,7369,4,"It's nothing more than a B or C grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an ""OK"" sound designer."
4409,tt0493424,7369,5,"Like the previous poster said, the problems seem to appear in post production ...voice dubbing, etc."
4410,tt0493424,7369,6,"Too bad, cause the plot's actually OK for a SG flick."
4411,tt0493424,7369,7,"I'll never rent another SG flick, unless he emails me asking for forgiveness."
4412,tt0493424,7369,8,Too bad I miss Kelly LeBrock... jimbo
4413,tt0493424,7370,1,"I've seen a lot of Seagal movies, and while most aren't great, or even good, this steamy pile lowered the bar for bad movies."
4414,tt0493424,7370,2,The plot: not sure really.
4415,tt0493424,7370,3,Something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something.
4416,tt0493424,7370,4,Who are the good guys and bad guys.
4417,tt0493424,7370,5,Hard to tell.
4418,tt0493424,7370,6,"Most of the movie is cut scenes going back and forth between people in darkly lit rooms complaining about how good Seagals character ""Mashall"" is."
4419,tt0493424,7370,7,Acting: Blows.
4420,tt0493424,7370,8,"Voice Dubbing ,,,,,, What was with the horrible voice overdubbing.!"
4421,tt0493424,7370,9,Could they of found anyone who sounded any less like Seagal.
4422,tt0493424,7370,10,"May as well had Cheech or Chong doing the voice overs, might of at least been entertaining then."
4423,tt0493424,7370,11,"This movie is boring, and completely stupid."
4424,tt0493424,7370,12,Avoid it at all costs!!!!
4425,tt0493424,7371,1,Steven Seagal....how could you be a part of such an awful film.
4426,tt0493424,7371,2,I rented this movie because your movies usually have been pretty clean.
4427,tt0493424,7371,3,I have lost a lot of respect for you being in an awful movie such as this one.
4428,tt0493424,7371,4,"Very, very poor taste!"
4429,tt0493424,7371,5,I am embarrassed that I even rented this movie.
4430,tt0493424,7371,6,"Steven, if you keep acting in movies like this one, I believe that your career is over."
4431,tt0493424,7371,7,"My husband and I have enjoyed watching many of your movies because you always can ""get the bad guy"" with a few hand maneuvers and make it clean...and also the language is pretty clean in your movies...but this one is something else."
4432,tt0493424,7371,8,I will think twice before I rent another movie of yours.
4433,tt0493424,7372,1,I'm so confused.
4434,tt0493424,7372,2,I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years.
4435,tt0493424,7372,3,"I've seen all of his films, and many of those dozens of times."
4436,tt0493424,7372,4,"I can only describe this film as ""bizarre."""
4437,tt0493424,7372,5,"Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, but I have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines, with a thin, whiny imposter's voice no less."
4438,tt0493424,7372,6,"What I also don't get is, if they had to dub SOME of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them."
4439,tt0493424,7372,7,I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us.
4440,tt0493424,7372,8,"But the Seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm, and sex appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies."
4441,tt0493424,7372,9,"What I found myself missing most of all was his cocky, self assured attitude and his bad ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin."
4442,tt0493424,7372,10,Where is that in your face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star...
4443,tt0493424,7372,11,"I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us if so, his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved is gone."
4444,tt0493424,7373,1,"I don't know what the rest of you guys watch Steven Seagal movies for, but I watch them because, as silly as they are, they're at least always good for a laugh."
4445,tt0493424,7373,2,"Why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing, when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of."
4446,tt0493424,7373,3,"Attack Force is by no means a great movie, but I felt it was as worthy a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other movies; in fact I didn't think it was one of his worst by a long shot."
4447,tt0493424,7373,4,"It had, most of the time, a half way coherent plot line, and it was, most of the time, fundamentally exciting."
4448,tt0493424,7373,5,"The ending really sucked, but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements."
4449,tt0493424,7373,6,"In the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised, but I actually thought that the acting, characterization if I may use such a big word and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect."
4450,tt0493424,7373,7,"Seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone faced, no nonsense man's man that we've come to expect, and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well, without ever up staging him."
4451,tt0493424,7373,8,"This, people, is what a Steven Seagal movie does."
4452,tt0493424,7373,9,Deal with it.
4453,tt0493424,7373,10,Or even better: laugh at it.4 out of 10.
4454,tt0493424,7374,1,This is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie Steven Seagal has ever made.
4455,tt0493424,7374,2,And that says a lot.
4456,tt0493424,7374,3,"Don't get fooled by the rating, it's way too good."
4457,tt0493424,7374,4,"This abomination hadn't even been worthy of a 0/10 rating, if such a thing existed."
4458,tt0493424,7374,5,"Absolutely no plot Worst action scenes ever, and there aren't too many of them either Seagal doesn't do anything himself, including the fighting, talking lots of dubbing, and so on."
4459,tt0493424,7374,6,As always.
4460,tt0493424,7374,7,"Seagal is fat, lazy and couldn't care less about this movie."
4461,tt0493424,7374,8,"Something which is very obvious all the way throughTake all the other garbage DTV movies Seagal has made, multiply them with each other, multiply this with a thousand billions, and all the badness you then get won't even describe 1 % of this absolute crapfest."
4462,tt0493424,7375,1,This movie was heavily marred by the presence of Steven Seagal.
4463,tt0493424,7375,2,Or as I should say Steven So dull!
4464,tt0493424,7375,3,"Like before Seagal is either too good or too stupid to re dub his own lines, leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped."
4465,tt0493424,7375,4,"A few films before this was he has done this too, but I don't think to this extent!"
4466,tt0493424,7375,5,"To be honest the film looks pretty good, the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie!"
4467,tt0493424,7375,6,"Of course, all told, this film is pretty bad."
4468,tt0493424,7375,7,It would have been much better without Seagal who has become a cartoon of himself.
4469,tt0493424,7375,8,Don't bother.
4470,tt0493424,7375,9,Anything over a buck for this one is too much!
4471,tt0493424,7375,10,I honestly think this is the last time for me and a Seagal film.
4472,tt0493424,7375,11,What's taken me so long to realize this.!
4473,tt0493424,7376,1,Steven what have you done you have hit an all new low.
4474,tt0493424,7376,2,It is weird since Steven's last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash.
4475,tt0493424,7376,3,Shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasn't even funny Steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway.
4476,tt0493424,7376,4,As for the action well let's just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes.
4477,tt0493424,7376,5,Seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and exit wounds. the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn't make scenes sometimes. flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time
4478,tt0493424,7377,1,"Even though the plot was very well detailed,and the story line was understandable the fact that Steven Seagals voice was dubbed with some one else's through out most of the movie was distressing as you were unsure who was talking ."
4479,tt0493424,7377,2,There were many parts where he would start to talk in his deep raspy voice and then the next some one else's voice was doing the talking for him.
4480,tt0493424,7377,3,I don't know the reason however if he had difficulty with his voice during production of the movie I think they could have re shot the events that did not contain his own voice when he had recovered.
4481,tt0493424,7377,4,I have rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film.
4482,tt0493424,7377,5,When one pays for a movie whether or not its at the theater or on DVD this movie was not worth the admission price that was charged.
4483,tt0493424,7377,6,I have been a long time follower of Steven Seagal and all his movies that he has done over the past years.
4484,tt0493424,7377,7,To date I think this is one of the worst ones we have seen yet
4485,tt0493424,7378,1,"Steven buddy, you remember when you said this: ""Try to find the path of least resistance and use it without harming others."
4486,tt0493424,7378,2,"Live with integrity and morality, not only with people but with all beings."" you have not been doing that, you have mortally wounded your fans and their morality with these ""films"" I wouldn't even bother if I didn't know you are so much better than this, I've seen the videos of you teaching, you are so much better than this why why brother why...steamroller productions has been steamrolled I promise bro i am not afraid of you I will tell you the truth to your face so we can fix it.well I like some others fell asleep 90% in, but to be fair i was tired and had a large meal just an hour before hand Sensai, what are you doing. 12 million. really. do you have any idea what we could have done with $12,000,000 It could have been in the theaters and a blockbuster hit, if you wanted we could have donated money from the huge profit to a homeless shelter or something."
4487,tt0493424,7378,3,"These post production people are ripping you off man the choreography was non existent, we can do better man, the eye blinking thing was from the men in black movie, i half expected will smith to appear or tommy lee Jones to tell your they were gills not eyelids."
4488,tt0493424,7378,4,"Seagal you are an Aikido master, why are you doing this to yourself, to us. when you came on the scene, you had such a fresh direct style, and it was obvious you are a teacher cause the way your moves were so clear and crisp, watching your first three movies i felt like you were teaching me something, now i feel like you are just being ripped off or something i feel like I need to save you buddy, this time you are the one who was killed and I'm gonna go and get revenge for you by helping you make the best movie ever. bro i know who you really are, i know the truth about the Nico movie. let's talk.contact me man i got some fresh ideas I am a nit picker, I swear you will not be disappointed with my attention to detail and we'll do it for the fans man, your fans deserve better, we're hanging on, but the strand is about to snap."
4489,tt0493424,7378,5,"I swear I will not let your movie out the door with a single mistake in it I'm still trying to figure out if that was the worst dubbing ever, or you have laryngitis, but i promise you i can do a better impression of your voice than the lame  who didn't even try."
4490,tt0493424,7378,6,"I sure hope you kicked him in the nuts as his payment. i can come up with a story and a plot that can be matched to your avenging the death of your student/daughter/wife/dog/house plant niche and I promise you we will bring you back, I promise, also I want to go in the direction, that makes people think, if you let me in i promise we will make a movie that people will walk away and have to have a discussion about it, a serious thought provoking, perception altering experience."
4491,tt0493424,7378,7,"Steven Seagal This is my official in writing permission for IMDb to release my contact info to you for the purpose of resurrecting one of the best martial arts heroes I have ever seen also, for the record hes not Italian, hes Irish and Jew so you call it bad acting i call it terrific acting, because you have believed for 20 years that Seagal is Italian : kinda changes your perception doesn't it."
4492,tt0493424,7379,1,What was Steven Seagal thinking.
4493,tt0493424,7379,2,I mean firstly I love Seagal.
4494,tt0493424,7379,3,I love all his movies up to the mid 2000s.
4495,tt0493424,7379,4,His early stuff is some of the best in the genre.
4496,tt0493424,7379,5,This however does not live up to its excellent name.
4497,tt0493424,7379,6,Attack Force with protagonist Marshall Lawson Seagal would be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in typical one liner ass kicking form.
4498,tt0493424,7379,7,"However, what we get is a crime mystery, bordering on a political thriller with little or no action."
4499,tt0493424,7379,8,Seagal is always in shadows because of his weight.
4500,tt0493424,7379,9,I could not follow this story.
4501,tt0493424,7379,10,There's people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug.
4502,tt0493424,7379,11,What happened in this movie.
4503,tt0493424,7379,12,"The dubbing of Seagal is a disgrace, a shambles and a shame."
4504,tt0493424,7379,13,Why dub the man.
4505,tt0493424,7379,14,The story is terrible.
4506,tt0493424,7379,15,"This got a 2/10 from me because of the scene where Seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him, and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera!"
4507,tt0493424,7379,16,"""Revenge is a two way street"" seagal says in this movie...well forget revenge Steven, you need redemption!"
4508,tt0493424,7380,1,I think its time for Seagal to go quietly into the night.
4509,tt0493424,7380,2,What I have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90's smash hits in comparison.
4510,tt0493424,7380,3,A secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something.
4511,tt0493424,7380,4,Somehow Seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world...or something.
4512,tt0493424,7380,5,"Seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans, every time I look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well I know Steven's athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him."
4513,tt0493424,7380,6,Usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close.
4514,tt0493424,7380,7,"Like I said, it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting."
4515,tt0493424,7380,8,The problem was it wasn't really scary and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the 40 year old 280 lb Seagal killed them all singlehandedly.
4516,tt0493424,7380,9,I guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruits ask Seagal to come to the strip club with them.2 out of 10
4517,tt0493424,7381,1,"Okay, first off, Seagal's voice is dubbed over for like 50% of the film..."
4518,tt0493424,7381,2,Why.
4519,tt0493424,7381,3,Because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions.
4520,tt0493424,7381,4,"From the very beginning, you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting, but they make no sense."
4521,tt0493424,7381,5,"That said, the story still sucked and doesn't make any sense at all."
4522,tt0493424,7381,6,"When I got the the end, I was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didn't even make sense."
4523,tt0493424,7381,7,Avoid like the plague.
4524,tt0493424,7381,8,This movie made me stop watching Seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse.
4525,tt0493424,7382,1,Well let me say that I have always been a Steven seagal fan and his movies are usually great but this just don't measure up to the rest.
4526,tt0493424,7382,2,This in my opinion is very stupid I did not like it all.
4527,tt0493424,7382,3,The biggest reason I don't like it is because it is very flawed and to me does not make much sense.
4528,tt0493424,7382,4,"The acting is very bad even Steven seagal does not do good acting, The rest of the actors I can see because they just do direct to video movies."
4529,tt0493424,7382,5,It does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it doesn't make much sense.
4530,tt0493424,7382,6,Ther is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it.
4531,tt0493424,7382,7,The special effects are very bad and you can tell are fake.
4532,tt0493424,7382,8,So all in all this has to seagals worst movie of all so if you want to see a Steven seagal movie don't rent this one just pretend it does not exist.
4533,tt0493424,7382,9,So just avoid this movie.
4534,tt0493424,7382,10,Overall score:  out of   out of
4535,tt0493424,7383,1,I feel blessed to own what is known as the worst Steven Seagal movie ever made.
4536,tt0493424,7383,2,I knew I was on to something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out.
4537,tt0493424,7383,3,By the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and I was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter.
4538,tt0493424,7383,4,Steven is Steven with an ever changing voice and totally unbelievable in his role as always.
4539,tt0493424,7383,5,Who the hell lets people with bad nappy hair pony tail mullets into the Forces anyway.
4540,tt0493424,7383,6,He also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years his junior.
4541,tt0493424,7383,7,"The supporting actors all look like they've been shot in the dark btw, did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a penlight torch for lighting."
4542,tt0493424,7383,8,This is truly abominable in every way possible.
4543,tt0493424,7383,9,Invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it this one's truly special.
4544,tt0493424,7384,1,STAR RATING:  Saturday Night  Friday Night  Friday Morning  Sunday Night  Monday Morning Marshall Lawson Steven Seagal is assigned to France on a reconaissance mission along with three new young strike team recruits after disobeying a direct order from above.
4545,tt0493424,7384,2,"However the night before they're due to strike, they are all found grusomely slaughtered by a killer with seemingly inhuman strength."
4546,tt0493424,7384,3,"With the French police dallying around with their own investigation, he goes in search of those responsible himself, only to uncover a corrupt faction of the military dealing in a deadly new drug that alters a person's DNA and gives them terrifying new strength."
4547,tt0493424,7384,4,Bad cover.
4548,tt0493424,7384,5,Bad title.
4549,tt0493424,7384,6,Bad post production tampering.
4550,tt0493424,7384,7,And bad trailer.
4551,tt0493424,7384,8,Pretty bad film.
4552,tt0493424,7384,9,"But, I've got to say, I don't think Attack Force is quite his worst."
4553,tt0493424,7384,10,I know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here perhaps not Steveday!
4554,tt0493424,7384,11,but I think a lot of the criticism has stemmed from all the bad news that went before the film rather than the actual quality of it itself.
4555,tt0493424,7384,12,I must say there was nowhere near as much dubbing or ropey editing as I'd been lead to believe.
4556,tt0493424,7384,13,The dubbing there was which made him sound like Martin Sheen with a groin problem!
4557,tt0493424,7384,14,was pretty awful and quite frequent but not in use for as large a segment of the film as I'd thought.
4558,tt0493424,7384,15,The plot flowed pretty smoothly as well considering all the messing about with the original finished film called Harvester that went on.
4559,tt0493424,7384,16,"Also as another reviewer noted, the film has a nice Gothic look to it, a new touch for a Seagal film."
4560,tt0493424,7384,17,"The absolute killer low point, though, was the complete and total lack of any exciting action, with only a few poorly filmed fight scenes for any fun."
4561,tt0493424,7384,18,"I have to be honest, though, I would rather watch this again than Flight of Fury, Today You Die or Out for a Kill."
4562,tt0493424,7385,1,"The movie is boring, the characters and scenarios are unrealistic, unbelievable, the action is hilarious."
4563,tt0493424,7385,2,This movie is a big mess.
4564,tt0493424,7385,3,"It almost seems like when the action music kicks in, the most impressive stunt is running."
4565,tt0493424,7385,4,Either voice is dubbed over with Mr.
4566,tt0493424,7385,5,McGregor or steven sang too much and it changed his voice.
4567,tt0493424,7385,6,"There is way too much dialog in this movie, and extremely bad acting on everyones behalf."
4568,tt0493424,7385,7,The movie is great sleep therapy.
4569,tt0493424,7385,8,The fighting is laughable.
4570,tt0493424,7385,9,The eye shape shift effect on the evil designer drug addict females was decent.
4571,tt0493424,7385,10,The main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed.
4572,tt0493424,7385,11,"The main villain was used to explain the story through interrogation, he would just throw random plots in such as spoiler ""CTX his designer drugis going to be in the water supply"" which is never addressed in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the movie."
4573,tt0493424,7385,12,This movie is highly recommended to pass.
4574,tt0493424,7386,1,I tried restarting the movie twice.
4575,tt0493424,7386,2,I put it in three machines to see what was wrong.
4576,tt0493424,7386,3,Did Steven Seagal's voice change.
4577,tt0493424,7386,4,Did he die during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone who doesn't even resemble him.
4578,tt0493424,7386,5,Or was the sound on the DVD destroyed.
4579,tt0493424,7386,6,"After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the actor's real voice."
4580,tt0493424,7386,7,"Though throughout most of the film, it sounds like the audio was recorded in a bathroom."
4581,tt0493424,7386,8,"I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to Goodwill, if I owned a copy."
4582,tt0493424,7386,9,"I rented it, but I will never do that again."
4583,tt0493424,7386,10,"I will check this database before renting any more of his movies, all of which were more or less good movies."
4584,tt0493424,7386,11,You usually knew what you were getting when you watched a Steven Seagal movie.
4585,tt0493424,7386,12,I guess that is no more.
4586,tt0493424,7387,1,"The DVD was a joke, the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sound out of sync and Segals voice not even his!!!!"
4587,tt0493424,7387,2,Pathetic!
4588,tt0493424,7387,3,"When the audio sync was better in about 5 minutes the poor plot, lines and actors should get another job because the movie business is not where any of them should be."
4589,tt0493424,7387,4,While Segal had some good movies in the early days the latest ones are a joke and should be a an embarrassment to him and the company that made it.
4590,tt0493424,7387,5,"If Segal was the one that handled this he better return to having another party run the show, because he has no talent what so ever in this."
4591,tt0493424,7387,6,This film is a complete embarrassment to all involved in its production and a disgrace to all who viewed it.
4592,tt0493424,7387,7,I turned it off in about 20 minutes.
4593,tt0493424,7387,8,I will be asking for my money back at Block Buster!
4594,tt0493424,7387,9,"Mark from Ontario, Canada"
4595,tt0493424,7388,1,drss1942 really took the words right out of my mouth.
4596,tt0493424,7388,2,I loved Segal's early films and feel like the only one who is still faithful to him.
4597,tt0493424,7388,3,"I just saw this movie ok, fell asleep about 90% through, so I didn't see the end."
4598,tt0493424,7388,4,"When I woke up and saw I was at the DVD menu, I was thankful I didn't subject myself to any more of that movie and didn't dare find out what happened at the end."
4599,tt0493424,7388,5,There was something strange about the voice of Segal and others.
4600,tt0493424,7388,6,"Kinda reminded me of the original Mad Max where the voice were dubbed, but in the same language Australlian is English, right. : Anyway, if I had 10 thumbs, they'd all point down right now for this Segal injustice."
4601,tt0493424,7389,1,I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie.
4602,tt0493424,7389,2,"He came out with a handful of good movies then descending into poor stories, bad camera work and a walk thru persona, he nearly lost me."
4603,tt0493424,7389,3,A few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie.
4604,tt0493424,7389,4,Now he's forgotten again.
4605,tt0493424,7389,5,This film is seriously dark on any level you care to name.
4606,tt0493424,7389,6,There is a lot of slash & gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless it's meant as a warning against the military.
4607,tt0493424,7389,7,Seagall may have had a stand in for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone else's voice was used most of the time.
4608,tt0493424,7389,8,Sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody & then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place.
4609,tt0493424,7389,9,Okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner.
4610,tt0493424,7389,10,"Anyway this bad guy was at least colorful, and very focused."
4611,tt0493424,7389,11,There's lots of gore if you like that king of thing.
4612,tt0493424,7389,12,It looked to me like the bad guys tore the same gash every time.
4613,tt0493424,7389,13,I'm just glad they didn't suck the blood from their hapless victims.
4614,tt0493424,7389,14,I harken you back to my summary.
4615,tt0493424,7389,15,Basically it is a horror movie disguised as an action film.
4616,tt0493424,7389,16,"Dec 6,2006"
4617,tt0493424,7390,1,How do you spell washed up fat Italian who can barely pull off a martial arts move without needing some heart medication.
4618,tt0493424,7390,2,In this movie we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of accomplishment since his career started it has been a steady decline into pathetic over indulgent behavior that has scuttled his career.
4619,tt0493424,7390,3,In this movie it looks like most of his training consisted of ordering the fetuccini alfredo at his restaurant every day.
4620,tt0493424,7390,4,"He is fat, slow and very old looking in this movie, hardly a martial arts action hero, more like a laughing stock clown."
4621,tt0493424,7390,5,It's time for Steven Seagal to retire this movie is about 2 hours of reasons why.
4622,tt0493424,7390,6,Plot: fat Italian guy with a big reputation on the force gets wind that a crime group may be playing around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warrior response.
4623,tt0493424,7390,7,"This pretense, although pathetic and laughable, gives opportunity for some over the top fight scenes that include blasting through walls like a comic book."
4624,tt0493424,7390,8,Did I mention this movie totally sucks and Steven Seagal is a complete joke. yeah.
4625,tt0493424,7390,9,I did.
4626,tt0493424,7391,1,Okay like most Steven Seagal fans I know I not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but I do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget.
4627,tt0493424,7391,2,The main problem with the copy I watched was the terrible over dubbing I know that in some films this has to be done and I accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away.
4628,tt0493424,7391,3,Also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it.
4629,tt0493424,7391,4,I was truly disappointed with this film and only hope Stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying/renting.
4630,tt0493424,7391,5,The story of this film had me wondering if I was watching a sci fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on I found it very confusing.
4631,tt0493424,7392,1,I look around in the video store still in shock how Steven Seagal with his track record of Bad action movies can still have 3 movies hit the shelves in less than a Year.
4632,tt0493424,7392,2,Attack force being the 3rd no less promised the first time entrance into the Sci Fi Genre for our ever widening Seagal.
4633,tt0493424,7392,3,Visions of bad movie entertainment flashed before my gullible eyes.
4634,tt0493424,7392,4,Sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come.
4635,tt0493424,7392,5,Seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the Trashy but enjoyable Shadow Man last time we saw him.
4636,tt0493424,7392,6,However Attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever!
4637,tt0493424,7392,7,"Don't argue for out for a Kill,Ticker,or even Black Dawn folks."
4638,tt0493424,7392,8,This is the bottom of the Septic tank here.
4639,tt0493424,7392,9,Anyone who says this is Steven Seagal's return to form should be forced to write a 100 page essay on the word Taste.
4640,tt0493424,7392,10,Seagal is yet another agent/I'm a supreme bad ass yet again named Lawson wants revenge for the killing of his Team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public.
4641,tt0493424,7392,11,Not to mention the dealers are not from around here.
4642,tt0493424,7392,12,The whole Production from Directing to the acting is poor.
4643,tt0493424,7392,13,Was this movie shot in the Dark.
4644,tt0493424,7392,14,Its gotta be the most poorly lighted movie since Howling 2.
4645,tt0493424,7392,15,The action is terrible and very badly done.
4646,tt0493424,7392,16,The Producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most:throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed Steven Seagal.
4647,tt0493424,7392,17,Who seems to show little enthusiasm here.
4648,tt0493424,7392,18,Can ya blame him.
4649,tt0493424,7392,19,While it has been said that Attack Force was not the movie Stevie signed on fororiginally Harvesterand surely has to be better than Attack force.
4650,tt0493424,7392,20,The post production tampering has not made it more coherent and made Seagal look worse.
4651,tt0493424,7392,21,I feel bad for Directer Michael Keusch and writer Joe Halpin as they are gonna be judged forever for the ill advised production re shoots.
4652,tt0493424,7392,22,So Now This leaves Seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this mess.
4653,tt0493424,7392,23,But after seeing how bad Attack Force has turned out do we really want him to make another movie.
4654,tt0493424,7393,1,I'm a huge Steven Seagal fan.
4655,tt0493424,7393,2,"Hell, I probably weigh as much as he does although I don't have the street cred to sport the frizzy mullet ponytail."
4656,tt0493424,7393,3,"Having stated my own bias and affection for America's favorite corpulent stage and screen hero, it is with a heavy heart that I must declare this to be his worst movie ever."
4657,tt0493424,7393,4,I'm not sure he could make a movie any worse than this.
4658,tt0493424,7393,5,In his defense the major problems with this film seem to occur in post production.
4659,tt0493424,7393,6,It's painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline.
4660,tt0493424,7393,7,That results in woeful voiceovers in which Steve's voice doesn't nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice.
4661,tt0493424,7393,8,"The editing is pisspoor and overall this starts bad, gets even worse, and by the end you'll wish you had rewatched The Da Vinci Code instead."
4662,tt0493424,7393,9,"Yes, it's that bad."
4663,tt0493424,7393,10,After this I don't know what to expect from Steve.
4664,tt0493424,7393,11,My friends still laugh at me for listening to his CDs.
4665,tt0493424,7393,12,Is it time I start checking out some of the Van Damme direct to DVD nutty logs.
4666,tt0493424,7393,13,"If you are tempted to watch this movie, rip your eyeballs out and flush them down the toilet."
4667,tt0493424,7393,14,A lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this.
4668,tt0493424,7394,1,"Attack Force has a horrendous title, and can almost certainly be judged by it's awful cover, because the film is horrible!"
4669,tt0493424,7394,2,"A mish mash of plot lines, a choppy mess, and a horribly stagnated pace, make the film hard to watch start to finish."
4670,tt0493424,7394,3,I managed this and I'm proud.
4671,tt0493424,7394,4,"As a fan of Seagal's work mostly of his old days, it's painful to see him star in such tripe."
4672,tt0493424,7394,5,"True Seagal's last half dozen movies or so, have sucked a lot, but some of them at least had some redeeming features."
4673,tt0493424,7394,6,Attack Force is a mess.
4674,tt0493424,7394,7,"From conception to delivery this film has undergone many changes, from an alien plot line, to the current one about a highly addictive super drug, about to be unleashed on the Romanian the film has several settings, none of which are Romanian, but all look like Romania because they are in Romania!"
4675,tt0493424,7394,8,populace.
4676,tt0493424,7394,9,The film is tacked together with little regard for whatever state the original shooting script was.
4677,tt0493424,7394,10,Plot holes and loose ends are abound in the film that's for sure.
4678,tt0493424,7394,11,"That's been a problem in Seagal's last few films as well, but never has the result been so boring."
4679,tt0493424,7394,12,There's a whole plot line about the water supply being poisoned with CTX that's the drugs cool name that is never resolved!
4680,tt0493424,7394,13,"Of course in recent years the plot's haven't been the main draw in the Seagal canon so there was a big onus on the other departments, especially the action."
4681,tt0493424,7394,14,"Before I regard the action though, all the other departments are poor."
4682,tt0493424,7394,15,"The direction is poor, or perhaps better put, made to look poor."
4683,tt0493424,7394,16,Who knows how director Michael Keusch originally intended this film.
4684,tt0493424,7394,17,"Between him finishing his job, the re shoots by stunt man Tom Delmar, and the editing, a coherent auteur vision is completely lost."
4685,tt0493424,7394,18,The best way to describe the film is that it's just all over the shop!
4686,tt0493424,7394,19,"The cinematography is dull, nearly inducing sleep, while the droning score sounding like it was produced on the cheapest of cheap synthesizers does nothing to excite matters."
4687,tt0493424,7394,20,"The cast too are poor, unable to salvage anything here."
4688,tt0493424,7394,21,"Seagal looks bored beyond recognition, and is dubbed through much of the picture, clearly when plot points are being changed."
4689,tt0493424,7394,22,"He looks tired and overweight, and lethargic, unlike he's looked in previous pictures too remarkable as the aforementioned have been key complaints in Seagal's recent pictures."
4690,tt0493424,7394,23,"The only redeemable cast member is Adam Croasdell as one of the villains, doing a slimy Brit routine."
4691,tt0493424,7394,24,"He seems to be a throwback to the alien plot line, because he's playing it inhuman."
4692,tt0493424,7394,25,"He seems like a cross between a body snatcher and a vampire ditto to the lead villain played by some hot chick who appears on occasion, seemingly waiting for her husband¬Ö Dracula."
4693,tt0493424,7394,26,Finally the action.
4694,tt0493424,7394,27,Well it's poor.
4695,tt0493424,7394,28,"Poorly conceived, poorly shot."
4696,tt0493424,7394,29,"There's not much either, and there's even less featuring Seagal."
4697,tt0493424,7394,30,"Stevo doesn't really bring out the stunt double here, because there's so little to do."
4698,tt0493424,7394,31,"There's even a lengthy repetitive and boring action scene on the hour mark that inter cuts occasionally with little flashes of Seagal's stand in because clearly Seagal wasn't there while the scene was being shot, and they wanted to have him feature in the action scene."
4699,tt0493424,7394,32,Seagal eventually appears in person to shoot two guys in the head.
4700,tt0493424,7394,33,"Seagal has a producers credit here and a script credit, but from what I understand the film has been altered behind his back to the current state it's in."
4701,tt0493424,7394,34,"Seagal will apparently not be working with these people again, or with Castel Studio's who continue to deliver horrifically sub Nu Image that's saying something, material."
4702,tt0493424,7394,35,Overall this is one to avoid if you are not a Seagal fan.
4703,tt0493424,7394,36,Seagal fans can also be safe in the knowledge that the big man probably won't want to do anything this bad again.
4704,tt0493424,7394,37,"Unfortunately his next film which has already been shot, with the same people, promises to be even worse than this."
4705,tt0096870,305,1,I'm glad that I saw this film after Mr.
4706,tt0096870,305,2,Sandler became famous.
4707,tt0096870,305,3,"It is bad....bad,bad,bad."
4708,tt0096870,305,4,There is no plot.
4709,tt0096870,305,5,It's like watching a painfully dull home movie.
4710,tt0096870,305,6,I really enjoy his other films......but if you're a fan like me....stay away from this one.
4711,tt0096870,305,7,It may change your thoughts on Adam.
4712,tt0096870,305,8,You may never recover from the horror that is this film....
4713,tt0096870,305,9,I've had a better time watching old folks play scrabble in a home.......
4714,tt0096870,306,1,Unwatchable.
4715,tt0096870,306,2,You can't even make it past the first three minutes.
4716,tt0096870,306,3,And this is coming from a huge Adam Sandler fan!!
4717,tt0096870,306,4,1
4718,tt0096870,307,1,"...okay, maybe not all of it."
4719,tt0096870,307,2,Lured by the false promise of bikini clad women on the movie's cover...but the HORROR...
4720,tt0096870,307,3,"THE HORROR... ...whatever you do, do NOT watch this movie."
4721,tt0096870,307,4,"Gouge out your eyes, repeatedly bash your skull in...do what it takes."
4722,tt0096870,307,5,Never again never forget!
4723,tt0096870,308,1,"Mere thoughts of ""Going Overboard"" aka ""Babes Ahoy"" make me want to weep."
4724,tt0096870,308,2,Throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie.
4725,tt0096870,308,3,"It's not even a supposed ""so bad it's good"" movie."
4726,tt0096870,308,4,I would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people can't see it.
4727,tt0096870,308,5,"Oh the pain, the pain..."
4728,tt0096870,309,1,Hello.
4729,tt0096870,309,2,"I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a."
4730,tt0096870,309,3,"Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia."
4731,tt0096870,309,4,Let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on Adam Sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time.
4732,tt0096870,309,5,Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails...or so I thought.
4733,tt0096870,309,6,Sandler encounters babes that like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound.
4734,tt0096870,309,7,"The babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known."
4735,tt0096870,309,8,"Adam Sandler fared bad in Going Overboard, but fared better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone's favorite, 50 First Dates."
4736,tt0096870,309,9,"Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick."
4737,tt0096870,309,10,"Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard ain't Dooley squat!"
4738,tt0096870,309,11,End of file.
4739,tt0096870,310,1,I had never heard of this Adam Sandler movie until I saw it on the wall at Blockbuster.
4740,tt0096870,310,2,"Being an Adam Sandler fan at the time, I rented it."
4741,tt0096870,310,3,HONESTLY I could only watch about 30 mins. of it.
4742,tt0096870,310,4,It was TERRIBLE.
4743,tt0096870,310,5,Do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public.
4744,tt0096870,310,6,"I honestly hope this movie goes OOP soon, and I hope it STAYS THAT WAY!"
4745,tt0096870,311,1,I just finished watching Going Overboard.
4746,tt0096870,311,2,I have to say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch.
4747,tt0096870,311,3,I even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min.
4748,tt0096870,311,4,Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this.
4749,tt0096870,311,5,"As for the writing, if thats what you want to call it, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in Hell!!"
4750,tt0096870,311,6,"I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this film was $10,000 and they were way under."
4751,tt0096870,311,7,Did Wallmart get a good deal on this.
4752,tt0096870,311,8,Every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor.
4753,tt0096870,311,9,"The only good thing about this movie is you can use the DVD as a coaster, or trade it to a friend, but then they might not be your friend anymore!!"
4754,tt0096870,312,1,"If you've ever seen this movie, you'd know that it!"
4755,tt0096870,312,2,"If you haven't, and want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you see this movie, because it ranks right down with the worst."
4756,tt0096870,312,3,"So, if you're REALLY bored, go rent it."
4757,tt0096870,312,4,"If you want to know what it's like, here's my little summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people."
4758,tt0096870,312,5,"Adam doesn't like how one passenger is getting all the babes, and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes."
4759,tt0096870,312,6,BUT WAIT!
4760,tt0096870,312,7,It only gets worse!
4761,tt0096870,312,8,You'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is.
4762,tt0096870,313,1,"This is definitely the worst movie Adam's ever done but at this point in his life, he was just happy to have a movie."
4763,tt0096870,313,2,There are 3 or 4 laughs in it but I used the fast forward button through some of it.
4764,tt0096870,313,3,Don't waste your time.
4765,tt0096870,313,4,"I only saw it because I wanted to see all of his movies, but it sucked."
4766,tt0096870,314,1,"I picked up this movie for $5 dollars at a discount book store, Adam Sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie, well, it wasn't."
4767,tt0096870,314,2,"There was absolutely no story line at all, bad jokes, and the other comedian said ""The F Word"" every other word he said,cursing usually dosen't bother me but this was over the top."
4768,tt0096870,314,3,"And even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when Sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie, it reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions."
4769,tt0096870,314,4,And last of all is when they would randomly put in Bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie.
4770,tt0096870,314,5,"In my opinion, Don't buy this movie, its a waste of money"
4771,tt0096870,315,1,Watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of Sandler.
4772,tt0096870,315,2,Truly a slow and painful death.'
4773,tt0096870,315,3,Bought the DVD in the $5.88 bin at Wal Mart.
4774,tt0096870,315,4,"But the thought that keeps echoing in my head is, ""How can I get my money back."""
4775,tt0096870,315,5,The most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat JUST DOES NOT SINK!
4776,tt0096870,315,6,Best constructive suggestion: Mystery Comedy Theatre.
4777,tt0096870,315,7,You know that show on the SciFi Channel in which some guy and his muppet machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks Mystery Science Theatre.
4778,tt0096870,315,8,"IMMEDIATELY, spin off a comedy program and feature this flick."
4779,tt0096870,315,9,"Without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck, I fear that viewers may actually begin following Sandler with ice picks and chainsaws."
4780,tt0096870,316,1,This movie is by far the worst movie ever made.
4781,tt0096870,316,2,If you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays Lars in heavyweights than don't make the damn film.
4782,tt0096870,316,3,I have to say that I could watch Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this POS of a movie.
4783,tt0096870,316,4,Adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace.
4784,tt0096870,316,5,Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to Cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender.
4785,tt0096870,316,6,Anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime.
4786,tt0096870,316,7,"If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I'd give it to the support Lorraina Bobbitt foundation before buying this movie."
4787,tt0096870,317,1,This HAS to be the worst movie I've ever attempted to watch.
4788,tt0096870,317,2,"In the first 15 minutes, there wasn't anything to keep my interest in this movie."
4789,tt0096870,317,3,"I was on vacation at the time, and had plenty of time to devote to a just for the fun of it movie."
4790,tt0096870,317,4,The condo we were staying in had this movie in stock they must have got it from the $1 store or something.
4791,tt0096870,317,5,"If you like Adam Sandler, this is nothing like any other movie he's made."
4792,tt0096870,317,6,This started with a bad premise and then just got worse.
4793,tt0096870,317,7,There's nothing even remotely funny in it.
4794,tt0096870,317,8,"I've watched a lot of movies, including some I didn't care for."
4795,tt0096870,317,9,"But if you decide to waste your time on this movie, don't say I didn't warn you."
4796,tt0096870,318,1,I stole this movie when I was a freshmen in college.
4797,tt0096870,318,2,"I've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it."
4798,tt0096870,318,3,"""Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny."""
4799,tt0096870,318,4,Wrong!
4800,tt0096870,318,5,"I can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match/insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain."
4801,tt0096870,318,6,"You would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know its true."
4802,tt0096870,318,7,This movie isn't worth the price I paid for it.
4803,tt0096870,318,8,"I've watched a ton of Steven segal movies, and I've even watched Crossroads twice... but I still couldn't watch this."
4804,tt0096870,319,1,"A friend of mine bought this film for ¬£1, and even then it was grossly overpriced."
4805,tt0096870,319,2,"Despite featuring big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole."
4806,tt0096870,319,3,"It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls'."
4807,tt0096870,319,4,Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women.
4808,tt0096870,319,5,"When the ship's resident comedian the shamelessly named 'Dickie' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender is presumed lost at sea, Sandler's character Shecker gets his big break."
4809,tt0096870,319,6,"Dickie is not dead, he's rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick."
4810,tt0096870,319,7,Perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.
4811,tt0096870,320,1,With Adam Sandler.
4812,tt0096870,320,2,This is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made.
4813,tt0096870,320,3,It's about cruise ship waiter Shecky Sandler wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship.
4814,tt0096870,320,4,"First off, there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly."
4815,tt0096870,320,5,It is so unfunny it's pathetic.
4816,tt0096870,320,6,"There is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor, but the f word is plentiful."
4817,tt0096870,320,7,"The budget is really low, and that also ruins the film."
4818,tt0096870,320,8,"It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton."
4819,tt0096870,320,9,"The opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply, and it is just pathetic."
4820,tt0096870,320,10,I hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too.86 mins. rated R for Language.
4821,tt0096870,321,1,"Shecky, is a god damned legend, make no mistake."
4822,tt0096870,321,2,"Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department."
4823,tt0096870,321,3,"We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores."
4824,tt0096870,321,4,"Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard."
4825,tt0096870,321,5,"We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back also."
4826,tt0096870,321,6,Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.
4827,tt0096870,321,7,"Now, as to why this film is so bad, where do I begin."
4828,tt0096870,321,8,"Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, must have been having one hell of an off day."
4829,tt0096870,321,9,"The rest of the crew stank, and what is it with Billy Zane."
4830,tt0096870,321,10,"His name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time, and he is a decent actor."
4831,tt0096870,321,11,Crazy.
4832,tt0096870,321,12,The production quality is absolute zero.
4833,tt0096870,321,13,"I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could, because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release."
4834,tt0096870,321,14,"Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come, and just how low he can go."
4835,tt0096870,322,1,"I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still haunts me to this day."
4836,tt0096870,322,2,"I was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it, so I have only myself to blame."
4837,tt0096870,322,3,"But like most, I didn't believe all the negativity."
4838,tt0096870,322,4,"Being a Sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad."
4839,tt0096870,322,5,I figured it was just Sandler haters.
4840,tt0096870,322,6,I couldn't have been more wrong.
4841,tt0096870,322,7,What we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny.
4842,tt0096870,322,8,That is actually quite an accomplish.
4843,tt0096870,322,9,"You'd think in a 90 minute comedy, they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing."
4844,tt0096870,322,10,"But no, it's just horrible."
4845,tt0096870,322,11,"It's not ""so bad it's good"", its just bad."
4846,tt0096870,322,12,"You cannot laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry."
4847,tt0096870,322,13,"You wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle, but they never come."
4848,tt0096870,322,14,Have you seen the movie The Ring.
4849,tt0096870,322,15,Where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later.
4850,tt0096870,322,16,"If this movie was on the video tape, people would die instantly, by their own hand, and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended, and that would be the first smile since they pressed play."
4851,tt0096870,322,17,"You might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to curb your curiosity."
4852,tt0096870,322,18,Don't.
4853,tt0096870,322,19,Please don't.
4854,tt0096870,322,20,"Trust me, I'm doing you a favor."
4855,tt0096870,322,21,"There are 2 types of people in the world, those that think Going Overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those that have not yet seen it."
4856,tt0096870,323,1,This movie was so bad I couldn't sit through it without doing something else.
4857,tt0096870,323,2,There was no plot and no point.
4858,tt0096870,323,3,"I was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian, I couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description."
4859,tt0096870,323,4,Politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining.
4860,tt0096870,323,5,So how was this made.
4861,tt0096870,323,6,Is there no quality control in film.
4862,tt0096870,323,7,Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience.
4863,tt0096870,323,8,It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure.
4864,tt0096870,323,9,He was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy.
4865,tt0096870,324,1,Worst mistake of my life.
4866,tt0096870,324,2,"I picked this movie up at Target for $5 because I figured, ""Hey, it's Sandler I can get some cheap laughs""."
4867,tt0096870,324,3,"I was wrong, completely wrong."
4868,tt0096870,324,4,Mid way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and I was still suffering.
4869,tt0096870,324,5,"Worst plot, Worst script, Worst movie I have ever seen."
4870,tt0096870,324,6,"I wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour, then I'd stop, and you know why."
4871,tt0096870,324,7,Because it felt damn good.
4872,tt0096870,324,8,Upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn....and that felt better than anything else I've ever done.
4873,tt0096870,324,9,"It took American Psycho, Army of Darkness, and Kill Bill just to get over that crap."
4874,tt0096870,324,10,I HATE YOU SANDLER FOR ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH THIS AND RUINING A WHOLE DAY OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4875,tt0096870,325,1,"Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton on the strength of class movies like ""Sling Blade"", ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" amongst others, it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there."
4876,tt0096870,325,2,"What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS bad."
4877,tt0096870,325,3,"I'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: ""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there."", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who."", ""The big stinking man is YOU!""."
4878,tt0096870,325,4,"Yes folks, it really is that bad."
4879,tt0096870,325,5,"Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes I guess he needed the work at that time in his career, and the rest of the movie is painful."
4880,tt0096870,325,6,"For some reason though, although it's undeniably awful, I don't hate it."
4881,tt0096870,325,7,"That's probably because I save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like ""The Fast and the Furious"" and not a ""no budget"" flick like this one. 2/10 at a push."
4882,tt0096870,326,1,This early Adam Sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989.
4883,tt0096870,326,2,His character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than the script.
4884,tt0096870,326,3,"The film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films, such as Big Daddy or even the corny Billy Maddison."
4885,tt0096870,326,4,"Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character."
4886,tt0096870,326,5,"The majority of the film's ""jokes"" come from Sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't get women."
4887,tt0096870,326,6,The film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film.
4888,tt0096870,326,7,"Sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content."
4889,tt0096870,326,8,The film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch.
4890,tt0096870,326,9,"I immediately wanted to forget I even saw this film after it was over, for fear that if more found out about it, it would ruin Sandler's career."
4891,tt0096870,326,10,"Pass this one up at the video store, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time."
4892,tt0096870,327,1,"Even if you're a huge Sandler fan, please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy!"
4893,tt0096870,327,2,"I bought this movie for $7.99, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man Sandler is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked judging by the R rating and scantily clad women on the cover."
4894,tt0096870,327,3,"Well, there are quite a few scantily clad women, but none get naked."
4895,tt0096870,327,4,"I'm not sure what point this was in Sandler's career, but I'm guessing it was even before his SNL days."
4896,tt0096870,327,5,I can be wrong.
4897,tt0096870,327,6,This is like watching one of his home movies.
4898,tt0096870,327,7,He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times...but we the audience are left to dry.
4899,tt0096870,327,8,"This is hardly a ""movie""!"
4900,tt0096870,327,9,"Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is ""no budget"" movie that's right, not a low budget movie, a NO budget movie."
4901,tt0096870,327,10,So our job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters.
4902,tt0096870,327,11,"There is no steady plot, it's like an extended sketch comedy show but a crude and badly written one."
4903,tt0096870,327,12,That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience.
4904,tt0096870,327,13,"And Sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line ""Take my wife, please"" and the audience is on the floor."
4905,tt0096870,327,14,I'm not even going to TRY to make any logic here.
4906,tt0096870,327,15,"Sure, Sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense the penguin in ""Billy Madison,"" the midget in ""Happy Gilmore's"" Happy Place but the comedy works."
4907,tt0096870,327,16,"This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you're curious about Adam's early days in film you still won't be interested."
4908,tt0096870,327,17,"You're better off checking out his start on SNL or maybe his underrated role in ""Mixed Nuts."""
4909,tt0096870,327,18,"Of course, the Sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle."
4910,tt0096870,327,19,"Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance, Billy Zane ""Titanic"" has a supporting role and the great Burt Young from the ""Rocky"" movies has a significant role."
4911,tt0096870,327,20,This awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99 cent rental section of your local video store and rightfully so.
4912,tt0096870,327,21,My score: 3 out of 10
4913,tt0096870,328,1,"I am a HUGE Adam Sandler fan, and one day I was looking at the Cast&Crew selection on one of his DVD's and saw 'Going Overboard' and decided to go out and rent it."
4914,tt0096870,328,2,So I went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it.
4915,tt0096870,328,3,"We put it on and we were shocked to see an Adam Sandler that didn't hit puberty yet, he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out."
4916,tt0096870,328,4,"I couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap, I didn't laugh, chuckle, or even smirk at this movie, actually the only time I smirked was when I saw how horrid this movie was."
4917,tt0096870,328,5,I could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie...and it didn't work once.
4918,tt0096870,328,6,"Although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script I realized why I had never heard of this movie,...because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before."
4919,tt0096870,328,7,"This movie, in my opinion, was the WORST movie EVER made,...."
4920,tt0096870,328,8,EVER!
4921,tt0096870,329,1,First: I bought it at the video store.
4922,tt0096870,329,2,Second: I watched it.
4923,tt0096870,329,3,Third: It was boring.
4924,tt0096870,329,4,Fourth: It was not funny.
4925,tt0096870,329,5,Fifth: Most of the antics were lame.
4926,tt0096870,329,6,"And last, but not least: It's not only a bad movie, it's a total fiasco."
4927,tt0096870,329,7,I am a huge Adam Sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film.
4928,tt0096870,329,8,I pity it because it was his first movie.
4929,tt0096870,329,9,"Even if you are a huge Adam Sandler fan, don't bother watching this movie."
4930,tt0096870,329,10,"Instead, just take the video, board a yacht, and throw it overboard."
4931,tt0096870,330,1,I wanted to punch the TV.
4932,tt0096870,330,2,Watching it was torture.
4933,tt0096870,330,3,I hated it.
4934,tt0096870,330,4,Never watch this movie.
4935,tt0096870,330,5,The terrorists are annoying.
4936,tt0096870,330,6,Adam Sandler is annoying.
4937,tt0096870,330,7,I normally like him but not in this one.
4938,tt0096870,330,8,I wanted to break the DVD.
4939,tt0096870,330,9,This is the most irritating film in the world.
4940,tt0096870,330,10,The comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious.
4941,tt0096870,330,11,The only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls.
4942,tt0096870,330,12,It was so irritating I wanted to punch the TV.
4943,tt0096870,330,13,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO ANNOY SOMEONE.
4944,tt0096870,330,14,"If you even like Adam Sandler a little bit, Don't buy it."
4945,tt0096870,330,15,It will just make you hate him.
4946,tt0096870,330,16,"Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it."
4947,tt0096870,330,17,Its a waste of the $1.99 I paid for it.
4948,tt0096870,331,1,"I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen, and yes, I have seen Cujo."
4949,tt0096870,331,2,"Adam Sandler is an abomination as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner."
4950,tt0096870,331,3,That's the plot.
4951,tt0096870,331,4,That's it!
4952,tt0096870,331,5,"Nothing else in the film makes sense, it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast, and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way, but more of a frustrating, 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason i can comprehend it certainly wasn't for humour."
4953,tt0096870,331,6,"Add to the mix Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian Accent i've ever heared, and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made, because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film."
4954,tt0096870,331,7,"I highly recomend seeing this film, as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see."
4955,tt0096870,331,8,"I guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be ""at least it wasn't as bad as Going Overboard""."
4956,tt0096870,332,1,I will start this off by saying I couldn't get all the way through it.
4957,tt0096870,332,2,I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site.
4958,tt0096870,332,3,I figured there wasn't any way I would regret my purchase.
4959,tt0096870,332,4,Was I wrong or what.
4960,tt0096870,332,5,"Seriously now, who approved this project."
4961,tt0096870,332,6,They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity.
4962,tt0096870,332,7,That's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad.
4963,tt0096870,332,8,The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam.
4964,tt0096870,332,9,The acting isnt much better.
4965,tt0096870,332,10,I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos.
4966,tt0096870,332,11,"Yay, who cares..."
4967,tt0096870,332,12,"Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny, and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser."
4968,tt0096870,332,13,That's about as much of the plot as I understood.
4969,tt0096870,332,14,Overall it's the worst movie I've ever seen.
4970,tt0096870,332,15,I own it on DVD and have given it to many co workers to watch.
4971,tt0096870,332,16,"Each comes back and laughs and says ""Wow I didnt think I'd ever say I shut off an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in...."""
4972,tt0096870,332,17,"My response is always ""Well now you can"""
4973,tt0887912,4829,1,As an ordinary movie watcher I can't say I enjoyed watching this one.
4974,tt0887912,4829,2,"It's not too emotional for a drama, not too gripping for a thriller, not too fast for an action."
4975,tt0887912,4829,3,"Plus, some moments of the movie are hardly credible."
4976,tt0887912,4829,4,"OK, I understand, soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there, but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life, carjack into the middle of a hostile city, and after being shouted at by a professor's wife run away, without having asked a question in a proper way."
4977,tt0887912,4829,5,"It would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so, but it's supposed to be a SERIOUS film about war.."
4978,tt0887912,4829,6,"There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture makes an impression that it's just a raw preview of a movie, and it needs considerable work."
4979,tt0887912,4829,7,"It feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier, but all these 'curves' of his psychology seem simply unnatural."
4980,tt0887912,4829,8,This picture left a question in my head: WHY.
4981,tt0887912,4829,9,Why they gave it an Oscar.
4982,tt0887912,4829,10,Why SIX.
4983,tt0887912,4829,11,And IMHO it's the most thrilling part of the movie :
4984,tt0887912,4830,1,REALLY.
4985,tt0887912,4830,2,REALLY....
4986,tt0887912,4830,3,I know if you make a political war movie you will get noticed but this movie was just garbage.
4987,tt0887912,4830,4,Horrible in every sense.
4988,tt0887912,4830,5,Terribly inaccurate in so many ways.
4989,tt0887912,4830,6,"I have an easier time believing the president of the United States suiting up, flying a jet fighter, and shooting down aliens."
4990,tt0887912,4830,7,It is easier to note the few things that were right.
4991,tt0887912,4830,8,My jaw dropped when I saw some one say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years.
4992,tt0887912,4830,9,"It was overacted, seemingly pointless plot diversions, and had questionable cinematography at times."
4993,tt0887912,4830,10,"X box, YouTube, ACUPAT utilities¬Ö did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004."
4994,tt0887912,4830,11,"It's not like you had to do extensive research, it was only five years before this movie came out."
4995,tt0887912,4830,12,I am an Iraq war Veteran and if you spent ONE day with an infantry platoon or an EOD squad you would realize how B.S. this movie is.
4996,tt0887912,4830,13,To compare this to Platoon or Saving Private Ryan is ludicrous.
4997,tt0887912,4830,14,Why don't you just throw Commando and Red Dawn in there too; I think those might be more accurate.
4998,tt0887912,4830,15,"If for some reason you can see past the unbelievable plot, the historical and factual discrepancies, then this movie might just be OK."
4999,tt0887912,4830,16,Nothing more.
5000,tt0887912,4830,17,"If you keep on hearing ""Oscar buzz"", and have to add your own pompous review, go right ahead."
5001,tt0887912,4830,18,"As for me, I am writing the director to see if I can get my 131 minutes back."
5002,tt0887912,4831,1,"I rented this film on Netflix after it won all the Oscars, to see if it was really that good."
5003,tt0887912,4831,2,The Hurt Locker is a very realistic portrayal for the most part of a group of soldier's rotation in Iraq.
5004,tt0887912,4831,3,"The film centers around Will James, a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks, and defusing bombs."
5005,tt0887912,4831,4,Where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the Plot and Direction of the movie.
5006,tt0887912,4831,5,This film has no clear plot unlike other films such as Black Hawk Down.
5007,tt0887912,4831,6,"What this film tries to do is focus more on the characters, and their different attitudes about the war."
5008,tt0887912,4831,7,"Bigelow does an okay job of focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to drag."
5009,tt0887912,4831,8,"Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, yet it feels like a 3 hour movie."
5010,tt0887912,4831,9,"One scene in the movie that was particularly awful, and ruined the films perfect credibility, was the sniping scene halfway through the movie."
5011,tt0887912,4831,10,"It was both unrealistic, and very long."
5012,tt0887912,4831,11,"Overall, I thought this film was OKAY, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of a 7, was because it was a major letdown for winning Best Picture at the Oscars."
5013,tt0887912,4831,12,"I felt like this film could have been so much better considering Saving Private Ryan lost Best Picture, but was much better than this film."
5014,tt0887912,4831,13,Another notable mention is Black Hawk Down which only won 2 Oscars.
5015,tt0887912,4831,14,I honestly do not know how this won best picture.
5016,tt0887912,4831,15,"If you are looking for an action packed war flick, rent Black Hawk Down."
5017,tt0887912,4831,16,This film will be forgotten in a year or two.
5018,tt0887912,4832,1,"i was intrigued to see how a little seen 2008 film had somehow won the Oscar for best picture of 2009 and thus went to see The Hurt Locker. sadly, all i got for the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this film had won awards purely for off the screen reasons.the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest you will ever see. when it's not busy being yet another Bourne Identity homage with dire, annoying ""shaky cam"" visuals, it shows off all the hallmarks of a second rate daytime soap opera in terms of lensing.the ""plot"" is threadbare, the characterizations are about as well developed as rejected Beetle Bailey comic strip ideas and the dialogue on the instances where the film gives up on being ""minimalist"" and for no apparent reason turns one or two soldiers into right chatterboxes is some of the worst ever recorded. in fairness, the actors do the best they can in the circumstances, just not enough to obscure how bad the project is.the whole film has the feel of it being intended as some kind of ""mockumentary"" that they clocked was bereft of humour and thus re edited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama.if you spend two hours on this film they are two hours you will never get back, and two hours wasted that you will regret for the rest of your life."
5019,tt0887912,4833,1,"Yes, this movie is a real thief."
5020,tt0887912,4833,2,It stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war hero movie to boost the acceptance support. for the wars U.S. is still fighting today.
5021,tt0887912,4833,3,"I do not really want to go here into politics, but come on, this is more clear than the summer sky."
5022,tt0887912,4833,4,"Hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding, no real plot at all."
5023,tt0887912,4833,5,I really feel myself in the 50's of Hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like.
5024,tt0887912,4833,6,"The same propaganda movies were produced that time, only with the exception that those were black and white."
5025,tt0887912,4833,7,"Even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the ""U.S. wars are cool"" genre, you surely have much better movies to choose from."
5026,tt0887912,4834,1,I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 Oscars which it was awarded.
5027,tt0887912,4834,2,Unfortunately it really isn't a good movie.
5028,tt0887912,4834,3,"The depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts, but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard."
5029,tt0887912,4834,4,"The actors put in a good effort, but for me I didn't really get what the movie was trying to be."
5030,tt0887912,4834,5,"It's not as atmospheric and gripping as Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as Band of Brothers, not as action packed as...well, anything."
5031,tt0887912,4834,6,"I certainly can't see why it was nominated for so much, nor why people are 'hyping it up' to these epic proportions."
5032,tt0887912,4834,7,"Mind you, given the calibre of movies in the last couple of years I suppose there's not a lot to choose from."
5033,tt0887912,4835,1,Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young US corporal in Afghanistan.
5034,tt0887912,4835,2,"He also happens to be a highly qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around Kabul, operating on wounded NATO soldiers."
5035,tt0887912,4835,3,"On a particularly difficult mission, he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 yards."
5036,tt0887912,4835,4,"He is then finally promoted to sergeant, but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career, so he quits from the Army altogether."
5037,tt0887912,4835,5,"One year later, frustrated with civilian life, he joins the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform."
5038,tt0887912,4836,1,Let's start by the simple lines.
5039,tt0887912,4836,2,"From the viewer's side, there a couple of good ""director details"", some points of view at the movie scenes that are nice."
5040,tt0887912,4836,3,"The special effects are good enough, a good acting/good scenery also."
5041,tt0887912,4836,4,But the story is way too simple.
5042,tt0887912,4836,5,"It shows how a elite Army bomb squad unit lives, acts and sometimes dies."
5043,tt0887912,4836,6,It shows the drama of living in war.
5044,tt0887912,4836,7,"In my movie experience as a serious action movie ""addicted"" guy, I missed that click that gets my eyes and mind stuck on the screen."
5045,tt0887912,4836,8,One of the things that need to be present in a movie in order to I consider it a good one is the ability of immerse the viewer in the movie reality and time.
5046,tt0887912,4836,9,It didn't happened to me.
5047,tt0887912,4836,10,"I stayed ""conscious"", for the entire movie."
5048,tt0887912,4836,11,"Honestly speaking, I think that this movie gained its place in fame based on the ""subconscious"" appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but not the adequate use as a movie fame generator."
5049,tt0887912,4836,12,"More than a movie about war, it grows its popularity based on that."
5050,tt0887912,4836,13,"A simple thought: if this was a world war II or I movie, only changing time, with everything remained the same, would it be this awarded."
5051,tt0887912,4836,14,Sure not.
5052,tt0887912,4836,15,Why.
5053,tt0887912,4836,16,Because there are great ones that elevate the bar way to high.
5054,tt0887912,4836,17,"Compared against its rivals in the Oscars, I don't think that all of the prizes it won are correctly awarded."
5055,tt0887912,4837,1,"I went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about, and I was as disappointed as surprised about how it got 6."
5056,tt0887912,4837,2,Oscars and 7.9 rating on IMDb as of today.
5057,tt0887912,4837,3,Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best picture and best direction Oscar for this sort of a really really bad movie and I wonder why.
5058,tt0887912,4837,4,Did the totally unrealistic 'cowboy' bomb disposal man storyline mean anything to somebody that I failed see.
5059,tt0887912,4837,5,Why did I keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old bad Western movie about a cowboy doing 'brave deeds' in the Wild Wild West infected with 'evil' Red Indians; but just that it was set in a different background this time.
5060,tt0887912,4837,6,"Was it given the Oscars because the director being ex of James Cameron, and made it a nice underdog gossipy story for day time TV shows to munch on."
5061,tt0887912,4837,7,Or was it some sort of Emperor's Clothes syndrome where most people realized it was junk but just couldn't say so because others didn't seem to be saying it out aloud.
5062,tt0887912,4837,8,And finally what was with that sniper scene where they showed the shell casing dropping in high resolution super slow mo as if to convey a 'deep message' or something.
5063,tt0887912,4837,9,Something in the lines of 'EOD guys make good snipers all of a sudden and they will get the filthy terrorists all the time'.
5064,tt0887912,4837,10,Was it just me who felt like there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the movie squeezed in for no apparent reason.
5065,tt0887912,4837,11,And you can get the Oscars for editing and directing for that..
5066,tt0887912,4837,12,"If you haven't seen this yet, don't waste your money on tickets."
5067,tt0887912,4837,13,Wait till they run it on TV in a few years.
5068,tt0887912,4837,14,You are not going to miss much.
5069,tt0887912,4838,1,I decided to watch this one because it's been nominated for Oscar this year.
5070,tt0887912,4838,2,"I guess as many folks here I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and disappointed."
5071,tt0887912,4838,3,"First scene was OK but the whole rest of the movie in ""shaky hands"" camera mode is really annoying.i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for Oscar is this:American ""military machine"" people, who makes money on war urgently need an excuse or justification of war in Iraq by bungling up something sort of patriotic.why these ""heroic"" efforts of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of ""loving war like a drug""..."
5072,tt0887912,4838,4,"Oh, please, come on!"
5073,tt0887912,4838,5,what a bore!
5074,tt0887912,4838,6,watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall...
5075,tt0887912,4839,1,...
5076,tt0887912,4839,2,And being let down bigger than ever before.
5077,tt0887912,4839,3,"I won't make any direct references or anything here, but to say the least, this film is pathetic."
5078,tt0887912,4839,4,"If you're military trained, don't bother watching."
5079,tt0887912,4839,5,I put it on the DVD with 2 friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action / war flick.
5080,tt0887912,4839,6,Why couldn't I just have read the reviews first.
5081,tt0887912,4839,7,"Already at the first ""bomb"" scene the film has huge glitches, and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger."
5082,tt0887912,4839,8,"My 2 friends, not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the filmmaker's mistakes almost as fast as I myself did and asked me if some of the things going on we're realistic."
5083,tt0887912,4839,9,"Well, as you might have guessed, they're not at all."
5084,tt0887912,4839,10,Avoid this movie unless you're able to overlook these completely idiotic and re occurring mistakes being made. 2/10 for catching my interest at first.
5085,tt0887912,4840,1,This whole film should have lasted 45 minutes maximum.
5086,tt0887912,4840,2,"Although an interesting concept/theme, it really did not develop as a story."
5087,tt0887912,4840,3,"Once the initial idea of a brave stupid. bomb disposal expert cowboy. are introduced, and this happens very early in the film, the rest is repetitious."
5088,tt0887912,4840,4,"Characters were not explored, and aspects of the location and politics were ignored."
5089,tt0887912,4840,5,"There was some nice insight into the appalling difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment, and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and foe."
5090,tt0887912,4840,6,But the way in which the unit operated stretched belief!
5091,tt0887912,4840,7,"Individual performances were good, and special effects were adequate, but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content."
5092,tt0887912,4841,1,REALLY...
5093,tt0887912,4841,2,I am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here!
5094,tt0887912,4841,3,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
5095,tt0887912,4841,4,"It is one big pathetic, grainy, clich√©."
5096,tt0887912,4841,5,"I would have laughed out loud, and a lot, but was on a date with an ex military guy."
5097,tt0887912,4841,6,"I could not hide my other response, BOREDOM."
5098,tt0887912,4841,7,"Yes, I think my date, a flat line ""good old boy"", liked it."
5099,tt0887912,4841,8,That's not a compliment.
5100,tt0887912,4841,9,I know an actor wants to work....
5101,tt0887912,4841,10,Fine for the others.
5102,tt0887912,4841,11,"But Ralph, come on."
5103,tt0887912,4841,12,It was a painful tease from Ralph.
5104,tt0887912,4841,13,I vote a 2 only because Ralph looked SO STUNNING.
5105,tt0887912,4841,14,"But I must plead, Ralph, how could you."
5106,tt0887912,4841,15,"And, why.."
5107,tt0887912,4841,16,I'm going to go watch The End of The Affair to heal and recover now....
5108,tt0887912,4841,17,C1
5109,tt0887912,4842,1,Who did the research for this film.
5110,tt0887912,4842,2,"It's set in Baghdad in 2004, however all the Soldiers are wearing ACUs and have all Universal Camouflage Pattern gear."
5111,tt0887912,4842,3,No one was wearing that stuff in 04.
5112,tt0887912,4842,4,I just saw this film while deployed overseas and I can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was WTF.
5113,tt0887912,4842,5,"This movie made no sense, had characters come and go with no explanation, and people doing ridiculous things that would NEVER happen in real life."
5114,tt0887912,4842,6,"I realize that it's a movie, but it's obviously trying to portray something realistic."
5115,tt0887912,4842,7,"It fails miserably, but it's trying."
5116,tt0887912,4842,8,"It's like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas, chewed them up and swallowed, then vomited out a film."
5117,tt0887912,4842,9,I would not recommend this film to anyone.
5118,tt0887912,4842,10,I'm still not sure why I sat through the whole thing.
5119,tt0887912,4842,11,GI Joe was one that really made you think compared to this.
5120,tt0887912,4842,12,STAY AWAY!
5121,tt0887912,4843,1,Well I too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the Best Picture Oscar so I went to see it today.
5122,tt0887912,4843,2,What a major disappointment!
5123,tt0887912,4843,3,1 If you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the U.S. military who served in Iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are.
5124,tt0887912,4843,4,"They mirrored my own thoughts; as the movie played I a complete civilian kept thinking to myself, ""say WHAT. there's no way that would happen like that.."""
5125,tt0887912,4843,5,2 There's very little that actually happens in terms of plot.
5126,tt0887912,4843,6,A new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one who was killed a death that isn't really clearly explained.
5127,tt0887912,4843,7,The new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work.
5128,tt0887912,4843,8,His attitude puts others at risk.
5129,tt0887912,4843,9,THAT'S IT!
5130,tt0887912,4843,10,3 This movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed.
5131,tt0887912,4843,11,If you want suspense try one of the Bourne movies.
5132,tt0887912,4843,12,"If you want to see a war movie that's emotionally powerful, try renting Go Tell The Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and stars Burt Lancaster who told me PERSONALLY in a serendipitous supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work, and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over hyped Apocalypse Now, or an old WWII black and white classic Sink The Bismark, which, especially for an English film, is unbelievably heart wrenching."
5133,tt0887912,4843,13,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON Hurt Locker.
5134,tt0887912,4844,1,I am definitely in the minority opinion on this one.
5135,tt0887912,4844,2,"""The Hurt Locker"" has won more ""Best Picture"" awards from the critic groups than any other film this year."
5136,tt0887912,4844,3,"However, not only did I not like it, I found it hard to sit through."
5137,tt0887912,4844,4,There is minimal plot and little character development.
5138,tt0887912,4844,5,"They disarm bombs, fight, and disarm more bombs."
5139,tt0887912,4844,6,That is the entire movie.
5140,tt0887912,4844,7,But the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking.
5141,tt0887912,4844,8,"This has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap, documentary look to it."
5142,tt0887912,4844,9,The camera was shaking so much it was making me nauseous to look at the screen.
5143,tt0887912,4844,10,"I normally don't care for war movies and ""The Hurt Locker"" was no exception."
5144,tt0887912,4844,11,But you don't need to take my word for it because the critics love it.
5145,tt0887912,4845,1,There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award.
5146,tt0887912,4845,2,"Well, it does not deserve an audience as well."
5147,tt0887912,4845,3,"Ironically, one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly, the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least."
5148,tt0887912,4845,4,"Every frame, you feel you are getting the ""full picture"", its like someone is ""cropping your view"" from the edges."
5149,tt0887912,4845,5,The story is pathetic.
5150,tt0887912,4845,6,"Well, I will be honest, I could not bear to watch the entire movie."
5151,tt0887912,4845,7,The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor.
5152,tt0887912,4845,8,These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal.
5153,tt0887912,4845,9,"Take my advice, stay away from this piece of crap."
5154,tt0887912,4846,1,COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS.....
5155,tt0887912,4846,2,I'm surprised by the high rating of this film to be honest..really am.
5156,tt0887912,4846,3,All I saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say.
5157,tt0887912,4846,4,Note to self must check the rating for Platoon on hereThis movie was so black and white...
5158,tt0887912,4846,5,Americans good...anyone else either evil or useless.
5159,tt0887912,4846,6,I take it the British troops in it were meant to be SAS one of the most elite units in the world most would agree with I'm pretty sure they lost 3 men and the others ran away while the US troops who weren't even Elite soldiers in the fighting sense held the ground and opened up a can of whoop ass on them evil sneaky Iraqis.
5160,tt0887912,4846,7,Aye dead on strings to mind.
5161,tt0887912,4846,8,"The only good thing I have to say about this movie did come in this sense when the sniper took out the SAS man...muzzle flash from distance, good noise used...really well done that bit but the rest..."
5162,tt0887912,4846,9,Spare me what am I 10 years of age over here..!!
5163,tt0887912,4846,10,Well I'm not and can see nonsense propaganda in a movie and boy did this movie have it.
5164,tt0887912,4846,11,SPOILER...
5165,tt0887912,4846,12,"Oh aye and in the main crazy,wild guy can't stay at home with his wife and young child..no he has to sign up for another year to fight in a nonsense lie of a war!!"
5166,tt0887912,4846,13,Why...because young men need thrills or something apparently.
5167,tt0887912,4846,14,Like say I'm surprised by the high rating of this movie really am.
5168,tt0887912,4846,15,P.S.
5169,tt0887912,4846,16,I'm not hating America I'm hating the message of this movie that seems to not even want to confront issues of an illegal war in my eyes which OK fair enough because clearly there are people out there who think it's a just war for whatever messed up reason wanted to say something else her but censored but hey that's up to them.
5170,tt0887912,4846,17,But to churn out a movie so one sided like it's black and white...good v evil is lazy and treating me as a child.
5171,tt0887912,4846,18,In war there is a lot of grey and it's two sometimes moresides who believe in what they are fighting for.
5172,tt0887912,4846,19,Not Star Wars with something something dark side verses the goodies.
5173,tt0887912,4846,20,F' sake Hollywood at times you really do take people for mugs...then again 7.8....well maybe you are right to but I'll not be buying it.
5174,tt0887912,4846,21,Glad I downloaded this movie tell you all that for nothing.
5175,tt0887912,4846,22,;
5176,tt0887912,4847,1,"As usual, I am making a mad dash to see the movies I haven't watched yet in anticipation of the Oscars."
5177,tt0887912,4847,2,I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley.
5178,tt0887912,4847,3,I can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has.
5179,tt0887912,4847,4,There is no story!!
5180,tt0887912,4847,5,A group of guys meander around Iraq.
5181,tt0887912,4847,6,One day they are here diffusing a bomb.
5182,tt0887912,4847,7,"Tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside, by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire."
5183,tt0887912,4847,8,No wait here they are back in Bagdad.
5184,tt0887912,4847,9,There is no cohesive story at all.
5185,tt0887912,4847,10,The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures.
5186,tt0887912,4847,11,"By that I mean, we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying."
5187,tt0887912,4847,12,We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe.
5188,tt0887912,4847,13,And then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs.
5189,tt0887912,4847,14,What do you think is going to happen...
5190,tt0887912,4847,15,"Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn't follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways.."
5191,tt0887912,4847,16,Why yes!
5192,tt0887912,4847,17,Do you think the Iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy.
5193,tt0887912,4847,18,Why yes!
5194,tt0887912,4847,19,There is no story here.
5195,tt0887912,4847,20,The script is juvenile and predictable!
5196,tt0887912,4847,21,"The camera is shaken around a lot to make it look ""artsy""."
5197,tt0887912,4847,22,"And for all of you who think this is such a great war picture, go rent ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Deerhunter"" or ""Platoon""."
5198,tt0887912,4847,23,Don't waste time or money on this boring movie!
5199,tt0887912,4848,1,"I love a good war film and I fall into the ""been there, done that"" category."
5200,tt0887912,4848,2,So I would like to think my review is an accurate one IMHO.
5201,tt0887912,4848,3,Having just watched this film on DVD I can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish.
5202,tt0887912,4848,4,There is no way I can recommend this film to you.
5203,tt0887912,4848,5,"It started off with me shouting at the TV saying ""you wouldn't do that"" etc...but I soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so I chilled a bit."
5204,tt0887912,4848,6,But on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off I got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud...
5205,tt0887912,4848,7,I was right.
5206,tt0887912,4848,8,There simply wasn't any logic to the EOD scenes.
5207,tt0887912,4848,9,I just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger.
5208,tt0887912,4848,10,So much so I was left scratching my head all the time.
5209,tt0887912,4848,11,Then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the Humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert.
5210,tt0887912,4848,12,One of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some SAS wannabe contractors.
5211,tt0887912,4848,13,The sniper scene was just so laughable.
5212,tt0887912,4848,14,It just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then.
5213,tt0887912,4848,15,Then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience.
5214,tt0887912,4848,16,"It started with the ""Contact Right"" and went down hill fast."
5215,tt0887912,4848,17,If you had a Brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the EOD team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day.
5216,tt0887912,4848,18,Then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all.
5217,tt0887912,4848,19,You are just left watching and asking why hasn't it ended yet.
5218,tt0887912,4848,20,Then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh..another scene where you just wanted it to end.
5219,tt0887912,4848,21,It added nothing to the film.
5220,tt0887912,4848,22,Then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down.
5221,tt0887912,4848,23,This most be the most ridiculous scene I have ever watched.
5222,tt0887912,4848,24,It defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline...it was senseless and awful.
5223,tt0887912,4848,25,I still don't understand why they wasted time on it.
5224,tt0887912,4848,26,Then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter.
5225,tt0887912,4848,27,Pure comedy :The sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be.
5226,tt0887912,4848,28,I thought it was going to be stupid illogical EOD scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different.
5227,tt0887912,4848,29,But as hard as it tried it just bored me to death.
5228,tt0887912,4848,30,All I wanted was for it to end.
5229,tt0887912,4848,31,"It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid, senseless, actionish scenes."
5230,tt0887912,4848,32,There is no way I can recommend this.
5231,tt0887912,4848,33,Maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesn't make sense.
5232,tt0887912,4848,34,The only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high IMDb rating...which must be the 24/7 work of the box office PR team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good.
5233,tt0887912,4848,35,Sorry folks...it just ain't!
5234,tt0887912,4848,36,Not recommended...it will just bore you.
5235,tt0887912,4849,1,I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand.
5236,tt0887912,4849,2,WOW!!
5237,tt0887912,4849,3,What a pile of steaming poo this movie is!!
5238,tt0887912,4849,4,Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back....
5239,tt0887912,4849,5,"Finally someone bumped ""Stop loss"" from the 'Worst Iraq War Movie Ever' number one spot."
5240,tt0887912,4849,6,"To be fair, I don't think there are any good Iraq war movies anyway, but this was REALLY bad."
5241,tt0887912,4849,7,"I won't get into any technical inaccuracies, there's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all."
5242,tt0887912,4849,8,If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic....maybe.
5243,tt0887912,4849,9,"I guess the writer should be given the ""credit"" for this waste of a film."
5244,tt0887912,4849,10,He or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality.
5245,tt0887912,4849,11,Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was.
5246,tt0887912,4849,12,Was there a message.
5247,tt0887912,4849,13,Seriously though.....
5248,tt0887912,4849,14,WTF....
5249,tt0887912,4849,15,I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really.
5250,tt0887912,4849,16,"This film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that, the plot sucks, characters are shallow to say the least and the acting is poor at best."
5251,tt0887912,4849,17,"It's ironic, I suppose, that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year."
5252,tt0887912,4850,1,Some unrealistic movie spoilers included.
5253,tt0887912,4850,2,"From real life experiences, this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning."
5254,tt0887912,4850,3,I'm currently deployed on my second tour to Iraq as an infantry man.
5255,tt0887912,4850,4,This film has nothing near what would happen in real life occurrences.
5256,tt0887912,4850,5,"From the very start to name a few: the bomb cart, the EOD elements rolling out solo with no escorts, the EOD staff sergeant sneaking of VBC, having sleeves rolled the entire time in ACUs, to where i had to call it quits on my 2 dollar haji copy, the sniper scene."
5257,tt0887912,4850,6,"The list would continue, however, it is unnecessary to list things wrong happening with a time span of 2 minutes before more things were incorrect; and the point was made."
5258,tt0887912,4850,7,This movie is for people and critics to watch that have no understanding or experience with deployments or the military.
5259,tt0887912,4850,8,People with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy.
5260,tt0887912,4851,1,watch a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq count down their time before they can go home.
5261,tt0887912,4851,2,That in itself sounds boring.
5262,tt0887912,4851,3,"Every time that little caption came up telling us how long they had left, it just caused this film with no plot to drag on and on. hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home."
5263,tt0887912,4851,4,I must be missing something.
5264,tt0887912,4851,5,I'm a great fan of war films if they are done well.
5265,tt0887912,4851,6,"This had ""jarhead"" syndrome."
5266,tt0887912,4851,7,"A film that at times was beautifully shot, but cinematography doesn't stop it from being totally dull and pointless."
5267,tt0887912,4851,8,"And get over the slow mo ""cartridges coming out of the gun"" shot already. they could have saved money and just got stock footage from any other film with a gun in it."
5268,tt0887912,4851,9,"I didn't have any empathy for the main guy in it, i was constantly hoping that his recklessness would cause him to die."
5269,tt0887912,4851,10,In fact the film would have worked much better if he had.
5270,tt0887912,4851,11,"I read some reviews and seemed to get the feeling that those who had been in the armed forces disliked it, and everyone else loved it."
5271,tt0887912,4851,12,"I have never been in the forces, and I'm with them."
5272,tt0887912,4851,13,It's pretentious drivel. the 3 stars are for the cinematography.
5273,tt0887912,4852,1,"I saw this movie once, and I thought it was OK."
5274,tt0887912,4852,2,"Then my friends at work said ""Watch it again, it's better""."
5275,tt0887912,4852,3,So I did.
5276,tt0887912,4852,4,"And to my surprise, it was WORSE on the second time!"
5277,tt0887912,4852,5,"There's a word limit, so I'm going to get the ball rolling here."
5278,tt0887912,4852,6,The bombing scenes were all so stupid.
5279,tt0887912,4852,7,Why on earth would anyone WAIT to trigger the explosion...
5280,tt0887912,4852,8,None of the characters here are even remotely likable.
5281,tt0887912,4852,9,"Not on the first time, not even the second."
5282,tt0887912,4852,10,"Oh, and last time I checked, a car does not explode from a single gun shot, nor can a fire THAT huge be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher... did the above 3/10 viewers actually watch the movie..."
5283,tt0887912,4852,11,"The camera is so shaky, I can barely tell what is going on."
5284,tt0887912,4852,12,"That opening scene with the robot had my stomach off put, the rest of the movie was not much better."
5285,tt0887912,4852,13,The sniper scene.
5286,tt0887912,4852,14,"The McManus Brothers from ""The Boondock Saints"" would roll their eyes, it was so stupid."
5287,tt0887912,4852,15,"First off, why did the guy plant his gun where one person had gotten shot."
5288,tt0887912,4852,16,"Furthermore, why would he spend THAT much time cleaning the bullets, reloading, aiming and NOT get shot, when there was so much chaos going on around him."
5289,tt0887912,4852,17,SAS types RUNNING instead of staying and fighting back......
5290,tt0887912,4852,18,Huh.....
5291,tt0887912,4852,19,Are the soldiers... gay......
5292,tt0887912,4852,20,"I didn't mean to sound homophobic, but honestly, that scene was so ridiculous."
5293,tt0887912,4852,21,"Too long for its own good, yet too short for the amount of material crammed into it."
5294,tt0887912,4852,22,"Bigelow seems to think that the more action, the better."
5295,tt0887912,4852,23,Looks like she is wrong the movie is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot.
5296,tt0887912,4852,24,"I know Watchmen is longer at 163 minutes, but at least that movie didn't drag."
5297,tt0887912,4852,25,"This movie, on the other hand, does, and for it, feels longer."
5298,tt0887912,4852,26,"The only good thing was Renner, who was satisfactory at best."
5299,tt0887912,4852,27,"But do yourself a favour, just skip this, and don't give into the hype."
5300,tt0887912,4853,1,"I'm a huge fan of war movies, and, as a Vietnam combat vet, have some experience with the technical details."
5301,tt0887912,4853,2,I worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them.
5302,tt0887912,4853,3,"Other vets, and Iraq vets in particular, have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well."
5303,tt0887912,4853,4,"Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and fails badly because of it."
5304,tt0887912,4853,5,"No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes."
5305,tt0887912,4853,6,Military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason;it saves lives.
5306,tt0887912,4853,7,The opening scene particularly annoyed me.
5307,tt0887912,4853,8,The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately.
5308,tt0887912,4853,9,"Yelling, ""Stop dialing"" is not an effective deterrent."
5309,tt0887912,4853,10,It got worse from there.
5310,tt0887912,4853,11,The scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious.
5311,tt0887912,4853,12,"As others have noted, your average EOD guy doesn't know jack about being a sniper, and to think any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination."
5312,tt0887912,4853,13,Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen.
5313,tt0887912,4853,14,"Somebody might shoot him, but this kind of risk taking is limited to the movies."
5314,tt0887912,4853,15,"I could go on, but, as I said, others have pointed these things out in detail."
5315,tt0887912,4853,16,"This is not a good movie, and if it wins any awards at all, it's a further reflection of why ""La La land"" is so named."
5316,tt0887912,4854,1,"Like a latter day Ayn Rand, Bigelow is la major muy macho in her depiction in the film of a few tough American hombres stuck in Iraq defusing roadside bombs set by the ruthless, relentless, child killing Arab terrorists."
5317,tt0887912,4854,2,"As Bigelow posits the Iraq war as the backdrop of the grand stage of human drama, one veteran bomb expert gets blown up and another shows up to replace him in the dusty, hot, ugly rubble that is Iraq, and a new hero is born."
5318,tt0887912,4854,3,"The new guy is what John Hershey described in his book, and later the movie, The War Lover, as a sadistic wingnut who actually isn't fit for civilian life, and requires the stimulation of war to sublimate and suppress his errant sexual desires."
5319,tt0887912,4854,4,"The war lover can only fully function in war, peacetime suffocates him."
5320,tt0887912,4854,5,"While Hershey chastised the war lover, played in the film by Steve McQueen in one of his greatest roles Bigelow glorifies him."
5321,tt0887912,4854,6,"The army needs war lovers, they are the bulwark of defense against our enemies."
5322,tt0887912,4854,7,"We can't handle the truth, that it is war lovers who are the best soldiers, the toughest men."
5323,tt0887912,4854,8,"According to the unironic Bigelow, regular men are pussies, the war lover is a special breed, the last of the cowboys."
5324,tt0887912,4854,9,"So what if he wants to bare back his men, or fondle an Iraqi boy."
5325,tt0887912,4854,10,He is a throwback to the sex and death cult of war.
5326,tt0887912,4854,11,"In war, sex is a thankless, loveless, don't ask, don't tell kind of male bonding."
5327,tt0887912,4854,12,Bigelow has no opinion on this; she just limits the options of masculinity in this ham fisted attempt at realism.
5328,tt0887912,4854,13,"Only a war lover can win the moral struggle between right and wrong, between American innocence and Arab perfidy."
5329,tt0887912,4854,14,Bigelow disguises her racism and arrogance behind the ingenuous facade of journalism.
5330,tt0887912,4854,15,She's just another gung ho yahoo depicting a brutal war against civilians as a moral triumph of the spirit.
5331,tt0887912,4854,16,"On the political front, Bigelow returns to the western genre and its relentless clich√©s again and again, ad nauseam: the wonderful world of the open frontier, which happens to be some one else's country."
5332,tt0887912,4854,17,"""You can shoot people here"" says a soldier ; the tough but human black guy companion, the soldier with a premonition of death, the gruff, possibly crazy commanding officer, the college educated fool who tries to befriend the enemy."
5333,tt0887912,4854,18,"You name it, Bigelow resurrects it."
5334,tt0887912,4854,19,"The man boy love is palpable in scenes with the cute Arab boy who befriends the war lover, but Bigelow plays it straight; she doesn't consummate the sex, just sanitizes it."
5335,tt0887912,4854,20,"What Bigelow really wants to show us is the ugly, sneering face of the Arab enemy."
5336,tt0887912,4854,21,"Any Iraqi who isn't pure evil is either demented, hostile or up to no good, anyway."
5337,tt0887912,4854,22,"They all deserve to die for their impudence, and many of them do in this glib gore fest film."
5338,tt0887912,4854,23,"The Iraqi women are all hysterical, they only make their presence known by screaming."
5339,tt0887912,4854,24,"They could be male stunt men in drag for all I know, you never see their faces."
5340,tt0887912,4854,25,"There is no female presence at all on base or in battle, although female casualty rates in Iraq would certainly disprove this."
5341,tt0887912,4854,26,Bigelow goes through all the motions one by one.
5342,tt0887912,4854,27,"She glorifies war, she canonizes the sadist nut case hero."
5343,tt0887912,4854,28,"The cowboys, surrounded by the subhuman Indians, prove their mettle by doing God's work and subduing the wretched terrorist infested hellhole with sheer bravado and suicidal mania."
5344,tt0887912,4854,29,"Toward the end, I felt like rooting for the Indians."
5345,tt0887912,4854,30,"In Bigelow's world, though, no mercy or understanding ever makes it through."
5346,tt0887912,4854,31,The Iraqis are dehumanized par excellence.
5347,tt0887912,4854,32,The slaughter of civilians is just the dramatic backdrop to our hero's psycho sexual struggle.
5348,tt0887912,4854,33,"Every U.S, bullet finds its mark."
5349,tt0887912,4854,34,"You have to love the guy, the war lover."
5350,tt0887912,4854,35,"It's just his way, he is the true hero."
5351,tt0887912,4854,36,"He's just a guy trying to get things done the hard way, and so what if he lusts for boy tang on the side."
5352,tt0887912,4855,1,"I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and incredulous."
5353,tt0887912,4855,2,"The first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is, naturally, shaky."
5354,tt0887912,4855,3,"But then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even during quiet conversational moments, to the point of ridiculousness."
5355,tt0887912,4855,4,Have the rental houses run out of tripods and Steadicams.
5356,tt0887912,4855,5,"The fact that it was shot on 16mm doesn't help, as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky."
5357,tt0887912,4855,6,"For all the effort Bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movie's credibility."
5358,tt0887912,4855,7,"A car would not erupt in flames after a single shot, and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small hand held extinguisher."
5359,tt0887912,4855,8,"A single Humvee would not be driving around Baghdad in 2004, but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack."
5360,tt0887912,4855,9,"It would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit a running insurgent at long range, where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target."
5361,tt0887912,4855,10,"I believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on or near a base, not some random spot in the middle of the desert."
5362,tt0887912,4855,11,"The oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within."
5363,tt0887912,4855,12,"The zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark alleys and lurking insurgents."
5364,tt0887912,4855,13,"Oddly, James never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley by themselves, thus setting up the attempted kidnapping."
5365,tt0887912,4855,14,"Speaking of which, the 3 man team is always depicted clearing buildings, chasing insurgents etc. on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there."
5366,tt0887912,4855,15,How many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging out a window to figure out he's not faking it.
5367,tt0887912,4855,16,There were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where Baghdad was in relation.
5368,tt0887912,4855,17,"I had no idea who the EOD team reported to, nor were any other characters fleshed out."
5369,tt0887912,4855,18,"These are things the characters would know, so we should too."
5370,tt0887912,4855,19,"Many of the ""surprises"" and scenes are perfectly predictable."
5371,tt0887912,4855,20,"Yes, it's obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the Iraqis he's trying to move along, that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle."
5372,tt0887912,4855,21,"Finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development."
5373,tt0887912,4855,22,"Renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenalin."
5374,tt0887912,4855,23,He's exactly the same at the end of the movie.
5375,tt0887912,4855,24,What's the point.
5376,tt0887912,4855,25,"If this is indeed the best so far of the Iraqi war movies, it's a sorry bunch."
5377,tt0887912,4855,26,"Just based on the half hour I saw of it, I'd recommend Generation Kill on HBO instead."
5378,tt0887912,4856,1,For the life of me I can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movie......and I think I have the qualifications to say so....
5379,tt0887912,4856,2,"I am a former Special Operations soldier with 14 years in the ""lifestyle"" ..."
5380,tt0887912,4856,3,"This movie was totally totally unreal and obviously written by someone that did very little research into life in the Army, in combat or at a team or platoon level."
5381,tt0887912,4856,4,Three EOD guys trouncing around Bagdad on their own.....
5382,tt0887912,4856,5,Get Real...
5383,tt0887912,4856,6,No chain of command.....
5384,tt0887912,4856,7,Get Real...
5385,tt0887912,4856,8,EOD clearing buildings...
5386,tt0887912,4856,9,Get Real....
5387,tt0887912,4856,10,EOD/ Military Intelligence / Sniper qualified buck sergeant....
5388,tt0887912,4856,11,Get Real....
5389,tt0887912,4856,12,Wait...
5390,tt0887912,4856,13,I shot and killed a bad guy and then let two guys take me without firing another shot or being injured at all....
5391,tt0887912,4856,14,Get Real....
5392,tt0887912,4856,15,"I carjack an Iraqi civilian, while I am only armed with a 9 mil, break into another civilians house, get punked by his wife then make it back to camp on foot in the middle of Bagdad at night without as so much as a scratch or confrontation...."
5393,tt0887912,4856,16,Get Real...
5394,tt0887912,4856,17,There is absolutely no adherence to military protocol Army and no resemblance at all to any Army unit that I have even encountered.
5395,tt0887912,4856,18,Totally unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of EOD who contrary to this poor film are not wild adrenaline seeking yahoos but extremely qualified professionals doing an incredibly hard job.
5396,tt0190524,6006,1,"I didn't agree with any of the theology in the Left Behind series, but nonetheless I found the books gripping and I read 8 of 12 of them."
5397,tt0190524,6006,2,Undeniably good writing and interesting story.
5398,tt0190524,6006,3,"However, I didn't have very high expectations for the movie."
5399,tt0190524,6006,4,There was no way mainstream Hollywood would have taken up a Christian series and produced a big budget movie.
5400,tt0190524,6006,5,So it was done independently... and it just felt like I was watching a really long TV show.
5401,tt0190524,6006,6,"It just didn't FEEL like a movie; it didn't have that movie ""experience"" to it, if anybody knows what I'm talking about."
5402,tt0190524,6006,7,"So the movie suffered because of that, and the low budget, poor special effects were another detraction for me."
5403,tt0190524,6006,8,"On top of that, I feel that Gordon Currie was woefully miscast as Nicolie Carpathia."
5404,tt0190524,6006,9,"Reading the book, my impression of NC was that he was supposed to be this charming, dazzling, amazingly handsome guy who spoke English with almost zero trace of an accent."
5405,tt0190524,6006,10,So I imagined somebody like Pierce Brosnan in the role.
5406,tt0190524,6006,11,"Instead, they found some Clay Aiken pencil neck who looks like an employee of the month from Best Buy, and gave him a really bad fake accent."
5407,tt0190524,6006,12,So that lost a few stars for me right there.
5408,tt0190524,6006,13,A movie is just not convincing when the major villain doesn't look or sound the way he's supposed to.
5409,tt0190524,6006,14,"The acting was okay, but nothing to write home about."
5410,tt0190524,6006,15,Some of the scenes like one of the conversion scenes can't remember which one were real seat squirmers for me.
5411,tt0190524,6006,16,"And some of the Christian rock music or whatever it was, was really out of place for some of the scenes, like in the one with Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom."
5412,tt0190524,6006,17,"In short, it wasn't a bad movie, but it just didn't do it for me."
5413,tt0190524,6006,18,"Stick to the book, folks, it's much better."
5414,tt0190524,6007,1,Surprisingly enough does movie does have some redeeming quality in it when it moves toward its end.
5415,tt0190524,6007,2,"For the other part this movie is being a really bad and lame one, with a small budget, insultingly bad written script and everything that goes with it."
5416,tt0190524,6007,3,It's silly that with all the money going around in the Christian circles they never can seem to get sufficient funds to make a decent movie with.
5417,tt0190524,6007,4,"I'm not a religious, so I couldn't care less really but film making does some like a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and getting people more interested and curious in reading the bible for instance."
5418,tt0190524,6007,5,In that regard these movies always seem like a wasted opportunity.
5419,tt0190524,6007,6,The low budget does really hurt the movie and brings it down.
5420,tt0190524,6007,7,It makes the movie laughable to watch with its effects and it just gives the overall movie a campy B movie like feeling.
5421,tt0190524,6007,8,But what's hurting this movie more is its writing.
5422,tt0190524,6007,9,The stuff that just happens in this movie is just insulting to the intelligence and then I'm not even complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story.
5423,tt0190524,6007,10,The way the movie progresses is just so improbable and the people within this movie do such highly unlikely things that it's being insulting to its viewers.
5424,tt0190524,6007,11,I also hated how the movie was being like a soap opera at times.
5425,tt0190524,6007,12,Seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full length movie and they added in some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up.
5426,tt0190524,6007,13,I just couldn't cared less really at times.
5427,tt0190524,6007,14,"Still it needs to be said that the movie gets more solid and steady toward its end, when its story gets more focused on its essence."
5428,tt0190524,6007,15,"Still it remains predictable all but it prevented this movie from being a complete wreck to watch and as far as these type of movies are concerned, there are far worser one to watch out there, though I don't think this movie will win over any new souls.4/10"
5429,tt0190524,6008,1,"If you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book, please don't give up on the series."
5430,tt0190524,6008,2,"I bought my first copy of any of the books in May of this year, and already I'm almost finished with book 10."
5431,tt0190524,6008,3,I dare say the movie is a piece of trash that doesn't do the series even a sniff of justice.
5432,tt0190524,6008,4,"While ""Left Behind: the movie"" only vaguely follows the story of the ""Left Behind"" the book, the characters aren't even close to accurate."
5433,tt0190524,6008,5,"A few examples: Rayford never acts on his feelings for Hattie he is about to when he's informed of the vanishings; Buck Williams is a blonde haired, magazine writer, not a TV reporter; Chloe is at Stanford, and a lot of the book details Rayford wondering if she 'survived'; Buck and Chloe don't meet until much later, at a meeting in New York, set up by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never 'in the book,' rather just in Rayford's flashback thoughts; the roads are so jam packed with wrecks following the rapture that Rayford and Hattie have to helicopter back to the suburbs... etc, etc, etc..."
5434,tt0190524,6008,6,And that's just from the first movie; they're about to release the third.
5435,tt0190524,6008,7,"Please, even if you didn't like the movies, give the book series a chance."
5436,tt0190524,6009,1,What is it with Americans and their hang up with religious gobbledy gook.
5437,tt0190524,6009,2,"To think this was a best selling novel is incredible, but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that delivers."
5438,tt0190524,6009,3,"In this case, all the good actors have gone to heaven and we're left with Kirk Cameron as a CNN type journalist!"
5439,tt0190524,6009,4,trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared.
5440,tt0190524,6009,5,"Oh yeah, there's a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and famine, or something."
5441,tt0190524,6009,6,"The good news is that this is done so cheaply, and with such inane dialogue, that it has sheer entertainment value in all of its unintended laughs."
5442,tt0190524,6009,7,Not recommended for anyone with a 3 digit IQ.
5443,tt0190524,6010,1,This movie is maybe one of the most boring movies of 2000 that I have seen!
5444,tt0190524,6010,2,Especially the music fails to create suspense when people suddenly disappear.
5445,tt0190524,6010,3,Also aspects such as martial law are not treated with the necessary seriousness.
5446,tt0190524,6010,4,"The story itself has problems: the UN could never take power over the world since the United States alone would not allow it but nations such as China, Russia, Japan, etc. would not either."
5447,tt0190524,6010,5,This would also play against someone trying to take over the world as Nicolae Carpathia does.
5448,tt0190524,6010,6,"This reminds me of James Bond movies, only that those have more action!"
5449,tt0190524,6010,7,Naturally the movie is made for Christians and only for Christians and they may enjoy it.
5450,tt0190524,6010,8,Since I cannot count myself a Christian I find the whole idea ludicrous.
5451,tt0190524,6010,9,"This prophecy furthermore seems to be, if believed to be true, dangerously close to other prophecies by cults for the end of the world."
5452,tt0190524,6010,10,Why fear such a possibility when we can make life as good as possible here on Earth without
5453,tt0190524,6011,1,"I didn't expect much from this film, but oh brother, what a stinker."
5454,tt0190524,6011,2,I found this gem in a giant crate of awful $5 DVD's at Walmart where else.
5455,tt0190524,6011,3,"As cheap as this disc was, I feel ripped off."
5456,tt0190524,6011,4,"The special effects had a high school look to them, the camera work marred by wobbly tripods and sketchy lighting and the acting was a perfect example of the 'Christian School'."
5457,tt0190524,6011,5,One can imagine the long and exhausting 'prayer meetings' by the production company after seeing the rushes come back the people who bankrolled this thing must have had seriously anti biblical feelings towards the inept production company that cranked this thing out.
5458,tt0190524,6011,6,Think of their anguish as they saw their $914.86 investment go up in smoke.
5459,tt0190524,6011,7,Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad perhaps the Xian film makers need to look at GOOD movies and attempt to copy some of the things that make them so good.
5460,tt0190524,6011,8,"Believable stories and characters, less hysterical arm waving and fanaticism, oh, and a story that appeals to everyone , not just true believers."
5461,tt0190524,6011,9,I.e.
5462,tt0190524,6011,10,"Stop The Sermon, Save It For Church."
5463,tt0190524,6011,11,"Take the Omen or Prophesy series, for example."
5464,tt0190524,6011,12,"Excellent films with compelling story lines, great cinematography and intense music."
5465,tt0190524,6011,13,No hysterical arm waving.
5466,tt0190524,6011,14,No preaching.
5467,tt0190524,6011,15,If this film had a laugh track it would have been MUCH better.
5468,tt0190524,6012,1,"I'm not a fan of the Left Behind book series the books are written at a 6th grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science, technology, and politics."
5469,tt0190524,6012,2,"While the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture, their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous an example is their explanation for the Russian/Arab invasion of Israel."
5470,tt0190524,6012,3,"Also, the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel."
5471,tt0190524,6012,4,"Still, I found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of Revelation."
5472,tt0190524,6012,5,"For a similar reason, I watched this film adaptation."
5473,tt0190524,6012,6,I am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor.
5474,tt0190524,6012,7,The acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over acting.
5475,tt0190524,6012,8,"The script is rather bad, though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis."
5476,tt0190524,6012,9,The characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped.
5477,tt0190524,6012,10,Events feel scattered and disconnected.
5478,tt0190524,6012,11,The dialogue sometimes sounds rushed.
5479,tt0190524,6012,12,At least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory.
5480,tt0190524,6012,13,"Here, the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book."
5481,tt0190524,6012,14,"The pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed, and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded."
5482,tt0190524,6012,15,The music is schizophrenic.
5483,tt0190524,6012,16,"At times, it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture."
5484,tt0190524,6012,17,"At other moments, it reminds me of sitcom and mini series music."
5485,tt0190524,6012,18,And still other bits remind me of a poppy MTV soundtrack that just doesn't belong in the film.
5486,tt0190524,6012,19,"I can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane, but that's it."
5487,tt0190524,6012,20,The other scenes involving the disasters after the Rapture are far from compelling.
5488,tt0190524,6012,21,The film also suffers from the book's preachiness although its message isn't quite as in your face.
5489,tt0190524,6012,22,"In all, I found the movie just as disappointing as the series."
5490,tt0190524,6012,23,This is not the film to rally Christians around it.
5491,tt0190524,6012,24,I hope that this film does NOT get any attention at the theaters next year.
5492,tt0190524,6012,25,It would be more unnecessary bad publicity for Christianity.
5493,tt0190524,6012,26,"For an example of a compelling, intelligent, well researched series based on Revelation that presents a realistic and Christian world view without offending the secular reader who after all should be whom a Christian is trying to reach read the Christ Clone trilogy by James BeauSeigneur."
5494,tt0190524,6012,27,It's a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality.
5495,tt0190524,6013,1,"I've read every book to date in the left behind series, and the movie hardly does any of them justice."
5496,tt0190524,6013,2,"Sure, I've seen worse movies, but this was incredibly disappointing."
5497,tt0190524,6013,3,This movie would have made a good MST3K episode.
5498,tt0190524,6013,4,"The script was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it felt like the actors were reading their lines, instead of actually saying them."
5499,tt0190524,6013,5,The characters were stiff and unlikeable.
5500,tt0190524,6013,6,"The effects were cheesy, and looked terribly fake."
5501,tt0190524,6013,7,The ending was awful.
5502,tt0190524,6013,8,"First of all, it didn't even go all the way through the first book."
5503,tt0190524,6013,9,"Second, it made no sense."
5504,tt0190524,6013,10,"If you hadn't read the book, you'd have no idea what was going on."
5505,tt0190524,6013,11,"It had to have been the most cheesy, film student like ending I've ever seen in a movie."
5506,tt0190524,6013,12,I'm upset that I actually paid money for this movie.
5507,tt0190524,6013,13,"If by some miracle, it does get wide release, they ought to totally overhaul it and let Hollywood take over."
5508,tt0190524,6013,14,"Those two wannabe film producers, and the wannabe director should leave movie making to the professionals."
5509,tt0190524,6014,1,Left Behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars.
5510,tt0190524,6014,2,"The acting is weak and uninspiring, the story even weaker."
5511,tt0190524,6014,3,The audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith.
5512,tt0190524,6014,4,Not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking.
5513,tt0190524,6014,5,The production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action.
5514,tt0190524,6014,6,The effects are wholly unoriginal and flat.
5515,tt0190524,6014,7,The lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably awful; even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget.
5516,tt0190524,6014,8,However none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it's wholesomeness and it's religious leanings; and who can blame them.
5517,tt0190524,6014,9,However it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd rate amatuer filmmaking.
5518,tt0190524,6015,1,Never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent.
5519,tt0190524,6015,2,"Let's see: FIRST, they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread."
5520,tt0190524,6015,3,"NEXT, they encourage as many fundamentalist Christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget."
5521,tt0190524,6015,4,"And FINALLY, when the film hits the theaters, get as many said Christians as possible to see it yet again, bus them into the multiplexes if necessary, NOT on the merits of the film itself, but because a #1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory."
5522,tt0190524,6015,5,"But THAT, of course, won't be enough."
5523,tt0190524,6015,6,"I imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give ""Left Behind"" anything short of a glowing review will be deemed ""anti Christian."""
5524,tt0190524,6015,7,"Of course, this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn't surprise anyone."
5525,tt0190524,6015,8,"It is, after all, good old fashioned Capitalism at work."
5526,tt0190524,6015,9,"What DOES surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole ""Left Behind"" mindset."
5527,tt0190524,6015,10,"As someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality, it leaves me scratching my head."
5528,tt0190524,6015,11,"It would appear that there are many, MANY people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a ""Rapture"" is going to occur, and that millions of people all over the Earth are going to simultaneously vanish INTO THIN AIR."
5529,tt0190524,6015,12,"What kind of reality, I wonder, are these people living in."
5530,tt0190524,6015,13,"Is this ""Rapture"" something they actually believe in, or is it something they fervently WANT to believe in."
5531,tt0190524,6015,14,"And when they reach the end of their lives and realize this ""Rapture"" has not occurred, will they be disappointed and disillusioned."
5532,tt0190524,6015,15,"Will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the ""Rapture"" is imminent."
5533,tt0190524,6015,16,"In a way, I almost wish that such an event would occur!"
5534,tt0190524,6015,17,What an interesting day that would be!
5535,tt0190524,6015,18,"What would be even more interesting is if the Apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion, not in the anthropological sense the authors of the ""Left Behind"" series have portrayed, but as more of a Stephen Spielberg production, with boiling clouds, trumpets, angels descending out of the sky, Moon turned to blood, the whole nine yards."
5536,tt0190524,6015,19,"Imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true, just as the evangelists had been warning for years, and that there was something more awesome than just the cold, hard, physical reality we inhabit."
5537,tt0190524,6015,20,Wouldn't THAT be something...
5538,tt0190524,6015,21,"Yet in the final analysis, it's that cold, hard, physical reality that I will content myself with."
5539,tt0190524,6015,22,"My life is not so meaningless that I need the fear of a ""Rapture"" and the ""End Times"" to make sense of it all ... nor do I need Heaven or Hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently, thank you very much."
5540,tt0190524,6016,1,This movie which was released directly on video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom.
5541,tt0190524,6016,2,"It is yet another thinly veiled, evangalizing ""rapture"" religious movie with the good guys the believers suddenly vanishing and the bad guys the non believersleft behind."
5542,tt0190524,6016,3,"It's an interesting concept, especially since we see it happen on a flight captained by a non believer who is having a sinful affair with a stewardess aboard needless to say that sinner doesn't disappear either!."
5543,tt0190524,6016,4,"Unhappily, with all the pilots being non believers, the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully over."
5544,tt0190524,6016,5,"Though this could have be interesting without the heavy religious browbeating, as a whole the plodding movie makes one gag, the acting is horrible and the obviously computer generated simulations are very fake looking."
5545,tt0190524,6016,6,Plus it's yet another movie shot in Canada that purports to be New York City.
5546,tt0190524,6016,7,Spare me...
5547,tt0190524,6016,8,I'll just read the Bible.
5548,tt0190524,6017,1,"the only enjoyable thing about this highly mockable movie is playing ""guess"" that location."
5549,tt0190524,6017,2,What Toronto landmark will stand in for what American/international location.who knew that the anti christ would be russian. obviously he can't be american since we need the yanks to save the day oh Buck... you'll tell us all the truth... you'll show us the light... and the way outta the building should those nasty anti christers get their way.
5550,tt0190524,6017,3,Five golden raspberries.
5551,tt0190524,6017,4,Faith is not enough to hope they don't make another of this ilk!
5552,tt0190524,6017,5,We don't gotta prayer.
5553,tt0190524,6018,1,"I find it sad that Christians and I am one feel that we must make movies like ""Left Behind."""
5554,tt0190524,6018,2,We have much better stories to tell that don't have to be so preachy.
5555,tt0190524,6018,3,I was very disappointed with this film.
5556,tt0190524,6018,4,"As an aspiring filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see this film as the perfect example for what I am not going to do with my career in film."
5557,tt0190524,6019,1,This movie is one reason IMDB should allow a vote of 0/10.
5558,tt0190524,6019,2,"The acting is awful, even what some here have lauded, the Carpathia character!"
5559,tt0190524,6019,3,The script looks like it was written in haste.
5560,tt0190524,6019,4,"In one scene, the black preacher who was left behind, when asked by Buck what ""dan7"" in the computer graphic meant, said, ""Daniel 7, CHAPTER 24."""
5561,tt0190524,6019,5,"He probably meant VERSE 24, but the film makers missed this slip up."
5562,tt0190524,6019,6,Perhaps the worst part is that the film's eschatological position is Biblically unsound.
5563,tt0190524,6019,7,"While many Christians have espoused the film's interpretation of end time events, such interpretation, in my opinion, is faulty."
5564,tt0190524,6019,8,"To understand these flaws, read ""Christians Will Go Through The Tribulation"" by Jim McKeever and ""The Blessed Hope, A Biblical Study of the Second Advent and the Rapture"" by George E."
5565,tt0190524,6019,9,Ladd.
5566,tt0190524,6020,1,I like end of days movies.
5567,tt0190524,6020,2,I like B movies.
5568,tt0190524,6020,3,I was hoping I would like this movie.
5569,tt0190524,6020,4,"I could ignore the poor effects, the often atrocious music, the cringe inducing lines."
5570,tt0190524,6020,5,"I could ignore the unexplained events, and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject matter."
5571,tt0190524,6020,6,I could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys.
5572,tt0190524,6020,7,None of these things kill the movie.
5573,tt0190524,6020,8,What kills this movie is that it's just plain and simple boring.
5574,tt0190524,6020,9,"Nothing actually happens; almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators' morals on the viewers, at the cost of actually having a coherent story, or any kind of suspense."
5575,tt0190524,6020,10,"If you're looking for an entertaining B movie, look elsewhere."
5576,tt0190524,6020,11,This movie is just boring.
5577,tt0190524,6021,1,I cannot believe that they managed to spend US$17million on this film.
5578,tt0190524,6021,2,"Spectacularly bad acting, egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average PC, unbelievable plot contrivances...a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the UN."
5579,tt0190524,6021,3,What.
5580,tt0190524,6021,4,"Not only that, but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they've tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix."
5581,tt0190524,6021,5,All this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money.
5582,tt0190524,6021,6,"If the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe, they would have used the money to help people truly in need."
5583,tt0190524,6021,7,"Now, /that/ might have swayed some people into actually listening to them."
5584,tt0190524,6022,1,I'm getting a little tired of people misusing God's name to perpetuate their own bigoted view on the world.
5585,tt0190524,6022,2,"Well I don't dismiss the idea of Armageddon, or the coming of the anti Christ, I do dismiss the idea that only certain people who live truly good livesThey seem to be mostly white Christian children will go to Heaven, while the rest of us must suffer through a millenia of Hell on Earth, just because we weren't good enough."
5586,tt0190524,6022,3,"God may be a judge, but I don't think He is going to measure every level of goodness."
5587,tt0190524,6022,4,Give the Creator some credit.
5588,tt0190524,6023,1,This reminds me of when I was a born again believer who was going to be a minister.
5589,tt0190524,6023,2,I never actually thought I would be a minister or even graduate from high school because I was almost positive I would be raptured to Heaven before that would ever happen.
5590,tt0190524,6023,3,That was before I discovered that Christianity was a bunch rubbish.
5591,tt0190524,6023,4,"I am now an atheist, and that just proves that the ""once saved always saved"" doctorine that Christians tell us is no more real than elves."
5592,tt0190524,6023,5,If it were true then why did I leave after many years of being a devout born again believer.
5593,tt0190524,6023,6,"Yes, I really was saved."
5594,tt0190524,6023,7,I prayed that silly sinners prayer with all my heart.
5595,tt0190524,6023,8,"If Christians were to read their Bible they would discover that their god thinks like rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities are alright according to him."
5596,tt0190524,6023,9,"They might be surprised to learn that no where is the word ""rapture"" mentioned."
5597,tt0190524,6024,1,I watched about 30 minutes into this film before I finally got sick of getting bludgeoned over the head with this movie.
5598,tt0190524,6024,2,"The soundtrack, the so called 'plot', and each and every actor."
5599,tt0190524,6024,3,"It's like they all think they're the main part of the movie and scream ""NOTICE ME!"""
5600,tt0190524,6024,4,over and over again.
5601,tt0190524,6024,5,"The bad guy has his bad guy music going on and says sinister bad guy like things, just in case you didn't quite catch on."
5602,tt0190524,6024,6,The good guy does brave and noble things just in case you didn't know he was the good guy.
5603,tt0190524,6024,7,"And oh lord, the plane scene."
5604,tt0190524,6024,8,"""MY HUSBAND IS MISSING!"
5605,tt0190524,6024,9,OH MY GOD!
5606,tt0190524,6024,10,"IT'S IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE GOT UP TO STRETCH HIS LEGS OR GO TO THE TOILET OR ANYTHING, HE MUST BE MISSING!"""
5607,tt0190524,6024,11,"And yes, I know, his clothes were still there, but honestly, she woke up and started to panic before she even had time to look at the damn seat he'd been in."
5608,tt0190524,6024,12,"As a religious girl, I want to apologize to the world for wasting the film this was printed on."
5609,tt0190524,6024,13,And I want my 30 minutes back.
5610,tt0190524,6025,1,"Left Behind is the kind of ""we know what we know cause we know it"" movie that Christians and most any other naive person needs to help them feel like what they ""THINK"" and ""BELIEVE"" not ""KNOW"" is right."
5611,tt0190524,6025,2,"But, at the same time I feel bad for the little guys, because this is not a well made film."
5612,tt0190524,6025,3,It does not help ANY message.
5613,tt0190524,6025,4,"I work at a video store, and I KNOW the ONLY reason people went to see this movie was because they were religious and they thought it was."
5614,tt0190524,6025,5,"ANYBODY on this earth who THINKS they know what will happen in the future is wrong, unless they think they know that they don't know."
5615,tt0190524,6025,6,I've had about enough but only after I've had too much of these people walking around with their noses in the air thinking that a movies starring a semi talented TV actor means something above me.
5616,tt0190524,6025,7,"Please, if you love yourself you'll stay away."
5617,tt0190524,6025,8,"I refuse to go into any detail about this movie not because A I didn't see it because I did, B it was too shocking for my atheist self to handle because it wasn't, or C I really don't have anything to say bad about it because I do."
5618,tt0190524,6025,9,"The Reason, which is a word nobody who helped make this movie understands is that I want this movie out of my head, I want that it was made out of my head, I want that I watched ALL OF IT WITH AN OPEN MIND out of my head, I want the message that Kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the end of the movie out of my head."
5619,tt0190524,6025,10,"I only want all the things that were in my head BEFORE viewing this movies there, anything directly connected with this movie that's floating in my head GET OUT!"
5620,tt0190524,6025,11,My peaceful rage is ending.
5621,tt0190524,6025,12,"I'm sorry that somebody in this world went to the theater to see this movie about what could happen in the future but won't when they could have given that Seven Dollars Plus to any number of Human, Animal, or Rain Forest charity."
5622,tt0190524,6025,13,"But if they did that then they wouldn't be able to ""BELIEVE"" in the fact that it's real, they might have to fact what is."
5623,tt0190524,6025,14,LEFT BEHIND ZERO out of
5624,tt0190524,6026,1,"review may contain spoilerspredictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV movie feeling to it. the idea of the UN as being taken over by Satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the bible. the premise is interesting, but its excution falls waaaay short. if you want to convert people to Christianity with a film like this, at least make it a quality one!"
5625,tt0190524,6026,2,"i was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of dreck. can't say much else about this film since i saw it over a year ago, and there isn't really much to say about this film other than.....skip it!"
5626,tt0190524,6027,1,"I grew up Baptist and I know the story this movie is trying to tell, although I no longer believe the story."
5627,tt0190524,6027,2,I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average Lifetime Movie of the Week.
5628,tt0190524,6027,3,"Mildly interesting, mediocre acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is sappy, and it is a bit melodramatic."
5629,tt0190524,6027,4,"And all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non Christians, ever."
5630,tt0190524,6027,5,Not a single curse word from any of them.
5631,tt0190524,6027,6,"But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced ""nuclear"" as ""nu cu ler,"" just like Bush."
5632,tt0190524,6027,7,"Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he, too, is called by God, that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does."
5633,tt0190524,6027,8,LOL!
5634,tt0190524,6027,9,I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that.
5635,tt0190524,6027,10,"After the ""nu cu ler"" incident, the movie began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda."
5636,tt0190524,6027,11,I was looking for something bold.
5637,tt0190524,6027,12,"Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I didn't find it here."
5638,tt0190524,6027,13,"If you're looking for mindless entertainment, stop here it's good for killing a rainy afternoon."
5639,tt0190524,6027,14,"But if you're looking for intelligence, look elsewhere."
5640,tt0190524,6028,1,I am a Christian... and I feel this movie is awful.
5641,tt0190524,6028,2,"Nobody but hard core, Bible belt Christians are going to like this movie."
5642,tt0190524,6028,3,The message is just too in your face.
5643,tt0190524,6028,4,"If you want to touch a wider audience, you have to be way more subtle."
5644,tt0190524,6028,5,You can't have the dad waving the bible around and carrying it with him in EVERY scene.
5645,tt0190524,6028,6,RIDICULOUS!
5646,tt0190524,6028,7,Poor direction.
5647,tt0190524,6028,8,"The reveal of people missing should have been terrifying, but it was laughable."
5648,tt0190524,6028,9,They leave their clothes on the ground.
5649,tt0190524,6028,10,"It reminded me of old Ed Wood movies: ""Oh my God!"
5650,tt0190524,6028,11,"People are missing!"""
5651,tt0190524,6028,12,That scene in the plane is just stupid.
5652,tt0190524,6028,13,"Think about it: if you found your relative's clothes next to you, you wouldn't just scream ""oh my god. they disappeared!"
5653,tt0190524,6028,14,"they're missing!"""
5654,tt0190524,6028,15,and start crying and yelling.
5655,tt0190524,6028,16,You would first be in denial... you just wouldn't jump to that conclusion.
5656,tt0190524,6028,17,Watch Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN.
5657,tt0190524,6028,18,My favorite shot is the dog sitting out on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him.
5658,tt0190524,6028,19,I about fell off the couch I was laughing so hard.
5659,tt0190524,6028,20,The music was so bad and so distracting.
5660,tt0190524,6028,21,"It was as if the composer was in his own world scoring his own movies. ""here's my chance to do a thriller"", ""here's my chance to do action!"""
5661,tt0190524,6028,22,STOP TELLING ME HOW TO FEEL JAMES COVELL!
5662,tt0190524,6028,23,"A good score supports what's happening on the screen... this movie needed more of an UNDER score, but instead it was as much in your face as the message was."
5663,tt0190524,6028,24,The writing was bland.
5664,tt0190524,6028,25,So was Captain Christian Kirk Cameron.
5665,tt0190524,6028,26,"Chelsea was the worse: ""you don't understand!"
5666,tt0190524,6028,27,"People are missing!""."
5667,tt0190524,6028,28,Brad Johnson was laughable.
5668,tt0190524,6028,29,"The two stand out performances came from the Anti Christ and the older guy sorry, can't remember their names In watching the ""making of"" to answer my question of ""what were they thinking..."", the producers and filmmakers and actors are just deluding themselves... saying ""we're gonna reach wide audiences"" and ""brad Johnson is amazing"" and ""this is just like a Hollywood movie""."
5669,tt0190524,6028,30,"I came to the conclusion that they just don't know what the ""heck"" they are doing."
5670,tt0190524,6028,31,I commend the effort.
5671,tt0190524,6028,32,Getting the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea.
5672,tt0190524,6028,33,Film is the best medium possible to do that.
5673,tt0190524,6028,34,"Look at movies like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNS, CONTACT, PASSION OF Christ, even O'BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU."
5674,tt0190524,6028,35,The bottom line is that the film needed to be made by people who have talent and vision.
5675,tt0190524,6028,36,"Unfortunately, it was not."
5676,tt0190524,6029,1,"If you are wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the the UN, Israel, and international affairs come from, look no further."
5677,tt0190524,6029,2,This isn't a supernatural Hollywood film loosely based on some biblical passage.
5678,tt0190524,6029,3,"Instead, this movie was made by a company Cloud Ten Pictures with a political and religious agenda."
5679,tt0190524,6029,4,"As a movie, the end result at times more looks like clips out of a televangelism program complete with family prayers and light breaking through church windows while harps are playing."
5680,tt0190524,6029,5,"For mainstream viewers, it may be hard to believe, but many people believe in this stuff literally, as presented in the movie."
5681,tt0190524,6029,6,"And that, perhaps, makes the movie important."
5682,tt0190524,6029,7,You probably won't find a more concise exposition of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens.
5683,tt0190524,6029,8,"So, if you view it, view it as a social/cultural document."
5684,tt0190524,6029,9,"If you are at all media savvy, you don't need to be warned about the unsubtle attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the movie."
5685,tt0190524,6030,1,"Okay, now, I know there are millions of Americans who believe in The Rapture: that moment when all people born again in Christ will be raptured up to meet God and all the rest of humanity will be left on earth to perish in plagues and fire and the heartbreak of psoriasis as the Antichrist battles it out with Jesus in an uncharacteristically warlike mode."
5686,tt0190524,6030,2,"And I know the books were best sellers. . .among believers, anyway."
5687,tt0190524,6030,3,And I mean no disrespect to all that.
5688,tt0190524,6030,4,"But I have to say, they stuffed this movie into a sack and beat it with the Suck Stick."
5689,tt0190524,6030,5,I'm sure the books are much better.
5690,tt0190524,6030,6,Really.
5691,tt0190524,6030,7,The plot needs no reprising.
5692,tt0190524,6030,8,"If you've watched this movie, chances are you read the book."
5693,tt0190524,6030,9,"I may be one of the only people on earth who actually watched this just for the sheer bad moving making experience, and I wasn't disappointed."
5694,tt0190524,6030,10,"Especially not by Kirk Cameron, the creepy little ""Growing Pains"" gremlin, who came of age on that show, found Christ, and decided that the SHOW should reflect his Christian values."
5695,tt0190524,6030,11,"Well, Kirk, your career has gone to the dogs, but now you can be happy that you're spreading the word of God in movies so bad, they never even make it to theatrical release."
5696,tt0190524,6030,12,"Well, that's not strictly true: I guess this was the only movie ever made that went to DVD FIRST, with a voucher for a free viewing of the movie when it was briefly released in theaters!"
5697,tt0190524,6030,13,I still have the voucher!
5698,tt0190524,6030,14,How many people do you suppose showed up.
5699,tt0190524,6030,15,"I don't know about you, but it never came to my town."
5700,tt0190524,6030,16,"Of course, I live in NYC, where we Godless liberals sit around tearing pages out of the bible and use them to roll joints."
5701,tt0190524,6030,17,So there you go.
5702,tt0190524,6030,18,"In fact, I'll bet out of three million people on Manhattan Island, not one would be raptured."
5703,tt0190524,6030,19,"Check out the supplementary materials on the DVD, where you'll learn the creepy behind the scenes details of these movies. . .the CAST and CREW all must be of the same religious mindset."
5704,tt0190524,6030,20,"They don't come right out and say this, but listen closely to what the filmmakers say."
5705,tt0190524,6030,21,It's like a bunch of Pod People got together to make a Pod movie.
5706,tt0190524,6030,22,How creepazoid is that.
5707,tt0190524,6030,23,"Honestly, this stuff just preaches to the converted, doesn't it."
5708,tt0190524,6030,24,"Can you imagine anyone who DOESN'T subscribe to the whole apocalypse thing watching this, slapping his forehead and saying, ""HOLY HOOVER DAM!"
5709,tt0190524,6030,25,"I better get saved PRONTO!"""
5710,tt0190524,6030,26,"Anyhow, I'm hooked."
5711,tt0190524,6030,27,"I gotta see the rest of these Christian fiasco movies, especially the one with Gary Busey, which I think is TRIBULATIONS."
5712,tt0190524,6030,28,At least Busey has an excuse for taking the part.. . .he cracked his head on some pavement when he crashed his motorcycle.
5713,tt0190524,6030,29,Oy.
5714,tt0190524,6030,30,"Oh, and one more thing."
5715,tt0190524,6030,31,"What's with all the shots of poor,innocent dogs whimpering, their leashes dragging uselessly along the ground, because their owners have been called to heaven."
5716,tt0190524,6030,32,What's up with that.
5717,tt0190524,6030,33,"Are we supposed to feel badly for the dogs, and if we do, what are we to make of God."
5718,tt0190524,6030,34,Doesn't it IRK people that there's no room in heaven for man's best friend.
5719,tt0190524,6030,35,Foo.
5720,tt0190524,6030,36,This is one more reason I'm agnostic.
5721,tt0190524,6030,37,Good night and good luck.
5722,tt0190524,6031,1,"It's been a while since seeing this the first time, so I watched it again with the second movie in the series."
5723,tt0190524,6031,2,"While I realize there is a 3rd movie out that I haven't seen yet, I'll review under the original title..."
5724,tt0190524,6031,3,"Just from the standpoint of production value, screen writing, and movie making, this movie fails on many levels, though it succeeds on a few as well."
5725,tt0190524,6031,4,"What can you expect from a low budget, ""B"" movie."
5726,tt0190524,6031,5,"Not much, and it works from the standpoint of production."
5727,tt0190524,6031,6,"However, the writing is certainly disjointed, with little in the way of character development...exactly what I'd expect when there is an agenda to a film."
5728,tt0190524,6031,7,"I didn't have a problem with the acting...the cast is solid; however, the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves."
5729,tt0190524,6031,8,"Because the film is ""Christian,"" this is predictable, as you can't very well portray violent chaos of the ""end times"" without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with Christianity."
5730,tt0190524,6031,9,"In other words, the mistake comes in making this into a G rated film when the content, even in the most conservative of Bible interpretations, would be R rated by any measure."
5731,tt0190524,6031,10,"So, if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into Christian faith, then the movie should be somewhat scary, right."
5732,tt0190524,6031,11,"However, you can't comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book, or in this case, series of books."
5733,tt0190524,6031,12,"There are certainly plenty of Christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies...but not the ""Left Behind"" series...and these movies ultimately fail because, while being best sellers, they are poorly written novels based on bad theology."
5734,tt0190524,6031,13,"As a Southern Baptist minister, I confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me, though I have yet to finish the last two books of the series."
5735,tt0190524,6031,14,"I have described them as decent fiction, and if the books would take the point of view that this is one ""possibility"" or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology study of the ""end times, then I could live with that."
5736,tt0190524,6031,15,"However, this series is divisive in Christian circles because it promotes the ""literalist"" interpretation of all Scripture above a more proper hermeneutic."
5737,tt0190524,6031,16,"Inevitably, this leads to the ""pre trib, pre millenial"" dispensation point of view, which confines an all powerful God far too by humanity's world."
5738,tt0190524,6031,17,"In other words, as I've always said, God shouldn't need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work."
5739,tt0190524,6031,18,"But because many people, particularly unstudied Christians, can't think beyond their own world views, we are left with a pro conservative, fundamentalist stance with regard to Bible interpretation, and attempts to push it through as the ""only"" interpretation."
5740,tt0190524,6031,19,"Thus, the books carry with them an agenda, not so much to get the ""lost"" to understand their need for Christ, but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the Bible."
5741,tt0190524,6031,20,"I recall very clearly reading several years ago in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was ""left behind"" BECAUSE of his non adherence to this point of view; as if ""real"" christians worthy to be ""raptured"" couldn't possibly hold to another eschatology."
5742,tt0190524,6031,21,"This is disturbing for several reasons, the least of which is because a ""rapture"" is only briefly mentioned in Scripture and it's connection to real, end time prophecy is tenuous at best."
5743,tt0190524,6031,22,"But the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the Christian community and how they portray ""true"" Christian behavior."
5744,tt0190524,6031,23,"Ultimately, I feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faith/religion instead of win people towards it."
5745,tt0190524,6031,24,"It turns all Christians into caricatures, equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within Christian thought and practice."
5746,tt0190524,6031,25,"As a Christian body, on the whole, we've done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history...and we certainly don't need to promote it by film to thousands, maybe millions of others."
5747,tt0190524,6031,26,"Thus, the ""Left Behind"" movies fail because the ""Left Behind"" books aren't worthy to be interpreted into movies."
5748,tt0190524,6032,1,I'm a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind.
5749,tt0190524,6032,2,"That being said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I've seen in some time."
5750,tt0190524,6032,3,"To have a good movie, you need to have a well written screenplay."
5751,tt0190524,6032,4,Left Behind fell woefully short on this.
5752,tt0190524,6032,5,"For one thing, it radically deviates from the book."
5753,tt0190524,6032,6,"Sometimes this is done to condense a 400 page novel down to a two hour film, but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever."
5754,tt0190524,6032,7,"Another thing, there is zero character development."
5755,tt0190524,6032,8,"When characters in the story get saved I won't say who, the book makes it clear that it's a long, soul searching process."
5756,tt0190524,6032,9,In the film it's quick and artificial.
5757,tt0190524,6032,10,"The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial."
5758,tt0190524,6032,11,"In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind again, I won't say who, it seems artificial."
5759,tt0190524,6032,12,"I realize as a Christian it's unedifying for me to say I disliked this film, but I can't in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done."
5760,tt0190524,6032,13,Perhaps it would've been better to make the first book into 2 3 films.
5761,tt0190524,6032,14,"Either way, Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers, we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way."
5762,tt0190524,6032,15,"I realize a lot of effort probably went into Left Behind, but that's the way I see it."
5763,tt0364986,9135,1,"Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you tried so hard."
5764,tt0364986,9135,2,"This is your magnum opus, a shining example to the rest of us that you are certainly worth nomination into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as you state on your 1998 era web site."
5765,tt0364986,9135,3,"Alas, it's better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt."
5766,tt0364986,9135,4,"With Ben & Arthur, you do just that."
5767,tt0364986,9135,5,"Seemingly assembled with a lack of instruction or education, the film's screenplay guides us toward the truly bizarre with each new scene."
5768,tt0364986,9135,6,It's this insane excuse of a story that may also be the film's best ally.
5769,tt0364986,9135,7,"Beginning tepidly, the homosexually titular characters Ben and Arthur attempt to marry, going so far as to fly across country to do so, in the shade of Vermont's finest palm trees."
5770,tt0364986,9135,8,"But, all of this posturing is merely a lead in for BLOOD."
5771,tt0364986,9135,9,"Then more BLOOD, and MORE AND MORE BLOOD."
5772,tt0364986,9135,10,"I mean, there must be at least $20 in fake blood make up in the final third of this film."
5773,tt0364986,9135,11,The film in its entirety is a technical gaffe.
5774,tt0364986,9135,12,"From the sound to the editing to the music, which consists of a single fuzzy bass note being held on a keyboard, it's a wonder that the film even holds together on whatever media you view it on."
5775,tt0364986,9135,13,It's such a shame then that some decent amateur performances are wasted here.
5776,tt0364986,9135,14,"No matter, Sam."
5777,tt0364986,9135,15,I'm sure you've made five figures on this flick in rentals or whatever drives poor souls such as myself to view this film.
5778,tt0364986,9135,16,"Sadly, we're not laughing with you."
5779,tt0364986,9136,1,"When the film began, I was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera!"
5780,tt0364986,9136,2,"In fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie."
5781,tt0364986,9136,3,Even direct to DVD films should have production values better than this!
5782,tt0364986,9136,4,"Heck, a large percentage of the home videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values!"
5783,tt0364986,9136,5,"All too often, the film seriously appears to be made by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it on with no camera person!"
5784,tt0364986,9136,6,Closeups and anything resembling camera work are absent in some scenes where they might have worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed closeups.
5785,tt0364986,9136,7,Yecch!
5786,tt0364986,9136,8,The film is about two gay men who want to become married.
5787,tt0364986,9136,9,"As if was made almost a decade ago, their only option was marrying in Vermont times have definitely changed."
5788,tt0364986,9136,10,"However, the recent acceptance of gay marriage cannot in any way be attributed to this film if anything, it set the gay marriage supporters back instead of helping as the movie stinks and never really tries to seriously address the issue."
5789,tt0364986,9136,11,"According to the film, religious people are one dimensional idiots who carry Bibles EVERYWHERE and shoot people as well as wives who have gay husbands are narrow minded when they learn their spouses have been living a lie go figure."
5790,tt0364986,9136,12,I'm sure glad it gives an honest chance to both sides on the issue!
5791,tt0364986,9136,13,The bottom line nothing about the film shows any professionalism at all and I even hesitate to call this a film.
5792,tt0364986,9136,14,It's more like a home movie and doesn't even merit a listing on IMDb or even inclusion on IMDb's Bottom 100 list of the worst rated films of all time.
5793,tt0364986,9136,15,"The acting is horrible, the writing is horrible, the direction if there even is any is horrible, the camera work is horrible and the plot is horrible."
5794,tt0364986,9136,16,It's a home movie!!
5795,tt0364986,9136,17,There is nothing positive I can say about this in any way except that it makes the films of Ed Wood seem like Oscar contenders in comparison and I am sure the ghost of Mr.
5796,tt0364986,9136,18,Wood is smiling every time someone watches this mess!
5797,tt0364986,9136,19,I don't care if you are gay or straight this film is not worth your time and I don't know how they managed to create DVDs of it.
5798,tt0364986,9136,20,I assume one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his free time!
5799,tt0364986,9136,21,"Seriously, this gives new meaning to the word 'bad'!"
5800,tt0364986,9136,22,"By the way, if the one lady in the film WAS a real lawyer, wouldn't the ability to read be an important prerequisite.!"
5801,tt0364986,9136,23,I'm just sayin'.
5802,tt0364986,9136,24,"Finally, with gay marriage being such a serious and important topic, can't we have a film that's BETTER than THIS that addresses the issue.!"
5803,tt0364986,9136,25,"This one, sadly, only invites laughter."
5804,tt0364986,9137,1,"What can I say, this is a piece of brilliant film making that should have won an Oscar."
5805,tt0364986,9137,2,A copy should be kept safe in a secure vault for posterity.
5806,tt0364986,9137,3,It should be required viewing for all high school students across the world.
5807,tt0364986,9137,4,"Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the most genius writer/director/producer/chef/babysitter/walmart greeter to ever grace the cinema world with his art."
5808,tt0364986,9137,5,Where do I begin with this one.
5809,tt0364986,9137,6,Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur was so completely breathtaking!
5810,tt0364986,9137,7,"And Mraovich as Arthur, wow, he is so attractive I'm surprised he didn't go for Mr."
5811,tt0364986,9137,8,Universe.
5812,tt0364986,9137,9,I couldn't contain myself during the nude scene.
5813,tt0364986,9137,10,I loaned this movie to my brother and he called me on the phone saying how Arthur's nude scene turned him gay.
5814,tt0364986,9137,11,"I am totally supportive of course, because of this film and it's beautifully crafted lessons in tolerance."
5815,tt0364986,9137,12,"Why just yesterday I burned down a church and I wrote ""for Sam and Arthur"" in its smoldering ashes."
5816,tt0364986,9137,13,The cinematography was the best thing about this film.
5817,tt0364986,9137,14,"When that Fed Ex plane took to the skies amid the palm trees of Vermont, I wept!"
5818,tt0364986,9137,15,"Why, I never even knew they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel on Fed Ex planes before this film."
5819,tt0364986,9137,16,It opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities.
5820,tt0364986,9137,17,"This film inspired me to enroll in Sam Mraovich's school of Screen writing, Acting, Directing, Composing, Casting, Producing, Production Design and Real Estate."
5821,tt0364986,9137,18,"I just want to say, ""Thank you, Mr."
5822,tt0364986,9137,19,Mraovich.
5823,tt0364986,9137,20,Thank you for bringing this creation into the world.
5824,tt0364986,9137,21,"We can never re pay you enough."""
5825,tt0364986,9138,1,"Worst film ever, this is a statement that people here on IMDb often throw around."
5826,tt0364986,9138,2,"Whether it's an Uwe Boll movie, bad classics like Manos The Hands Of Fate or the latest no brains summer action fest from Michael Bay, people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they're posting that there is nothing worse in the movie world."
5827,tt0364986,9138,3,"I envy these people, because they're blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit hole of crap movie making really goes."
5828,tt0364986,9138,4,"There are films out there so bad, so hideous, so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their awfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that bad."
5829,tt0364986,9138,5,"Ladies and Gentlemen, i present to you Ben and Arthur, an 85 minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it's a lot like a violent car crash, you know it's awful but you can't stop looking at it."
5830,tt0364986,9138,6,"The brainchild of self proclaimed ""hollywood actor, director"" and may i add beached whale Sam Mraovich, this film is legendarily terrible."
5831,tt0364986,9138,7,Let me give you a hint of how ego driven this project was.
5832,tt0364986,9138,8,"Mr Mraovich not only directed this film, he wrote it, produced it, executive produced it, scored it, edited it and then finally starred in it."
5833,tt0364986,9138,9,This is a man so blinded by his own ego and so believing of his non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child he fails to recognise just how catastrophic his bastard creation really is.
5834,tt0364986,9138,10,"Everything in this film fails on an epic level, the acting is the worst you will ever witness, the plot is the most ridiculous, the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard."
5835,tt0364986,9138,11,"I'm aware i've gone on a bit of a tangent here, but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it, i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel, but the truth is it wasn't even shot on film, it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust."
5836,tt0364986,9138,12,"Don't get me wrong, i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting, for example as much as i disliked it The Blair Witch Project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film."
5837,tt0364986,9138,13,"Ben and Arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on, even if this film was shot on a budget of 20 million with Hollywoods finest actors it would still suck, the plot is that atrocious, and the characters are even worse."
5838,tt0364986,9138,14,One of the main characters Arthur who is portrayed by non other than Sam Mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds ever put in a film.
5839,tt0364986,9138,15,You'll dislike him within 5 minutes of the start of the film and by the end of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing.
5840,tt0364986,9138,16,Apparently Mr Mraovich forgot that we're supposed to root for the hero.
5841,tt0364986,9138,17,"I don't want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you'll experience watching this film which i urge you not to pay for so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is, tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie."
5842,tt0364986,9138,18,"In one cut we hear one of the main characters say how ""they know a good lawyer and will give HIM a call"" the shot fades out then fades back in and this HIM they spoke of earlier is actually a woman, quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think."
5843,tt0364986,9138,19,"The second is simple, seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to Vermont, we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area."
5844,tt0364986,9138,20,I've never been to Vermont personally but i'm certain you won't find any palm trees there.
5845,tt0364986,9138,21,Imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by 10 and it still won't fully prepare you for Ben and Arthur.
5846,tt0364986,9138,22,"Imagine the absolute worst film you've seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still won't be on the same level as Ben and Arthur, this film is really that bad."
5847,tt0364986,9138,23,"However we should be glad in a way, films like this are a true rarity."
5848,tt0364986,9138,24,They give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves or that we can be screenwriters.
5849,tt0364986,9138,25,Simply because we'll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we'll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this.
5850,tt0364986,9138,26,"The real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered, and it is called Ben and Arthur."
5851,tt0364986,9139,1,I don't know what it is about this movie director Sam Mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie.
5852,tt0364986,9139,2,"I would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist, but this movie may be the most important of all time."
5853,tt0364986,9139,3,This movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt 'The Worst Movie Ever Made'.
5854,tt0364986,9139,4,"I've seen bad movies in my lifetime, but this somehow breaks what I considered bad into something much more hard to imagine."
5855,tt0364986,9139,5,"Everything in this movie is hilarious, but the single funniest thing is that Mraovich himself considers this to be a great movie."
5856,tt0364986,9139,6,Oh wow...
5857,tt0364986,9140,1,Phew I don't what to say.
5858,tt0364986,9140,2,This is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers.
5859,tt0364986,9140,3,Some of the acting reminded me of John Waters' early offerings.
5860,tt0364986,9140,4,Perhaps I should take that back I don't want to insult Waters' ability as a director/storyteller.
5861,tt0364986,9140,5,"I particularly loved the lawyer taking about the ""full faith and credibility"" clause."
5862,tt0364986,9140,6,"It's ""full faith and credit,"" by the way!"
5863,tt0364986,9140,7,"This also reminds me of ""The Conrad Boys,"" where the main actor is also the writer, director, film editor, etc."
5864,tt0364986,9140,8,"Those sort of multi involved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability albeit a stunt, some might say to pull something off like that."
5865,tt0364986,9141,1,"Oh man, what was Sam Mraovich thinking."
5866,tt0364986,9141,2,"What was anyone who was involved in this ""film"" thinking."
5867,tt0364986,9141,3,"Mraovich is the head of nearly everything of ""Ben and Arthur"": Director, writer, producer also EXECUTIVE producer!, caster, lead star you name it, he did it."
5868,tt0364986,9141,4,And he Mraovich sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making.
5869,tt0364986,9141,5,So what is wrong with this film.
5870,tt0364986,9141,6,Everything.
5871,tt0364986,9141,7,"The film is about two gay lovers, Ben Jamie Brett Gabel and Arthur Mraovich groan."
5872,tt0364986,9141,8,Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people.
5873,tt0364986,9141,9,"To make things worse, Ben's crazy ""ex wife"" they don't exactly divorce, Tammy Julie Belknap is steaming mad that Ben's left her for another man and demands Ben that they get back together saying that she can be gay, too!"
5874,tt0364986,9141,10,"and Arthur's Christian devoted, excessively hypocritical, equally batty as Tammy brother, Victor, is hell bent on making Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church."
5875,tt0364986,9141,11,The film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs ie.
5876,tt0364986,9141,12,"Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married they go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees; they fly back on a FedEx cargo plane hope they were comfy in a wooden crate, plus many, many more and plot holes to boot Victor calls killing Arthur ""The Final Plan"" which later changes to ""The Final Deed""; Arthur and the private intern detective drive the same car, blah, blah, blah."
5877,tt0364986,9141,13,"The ""actors"" are all very bad and are way, way over the top; the script is laughably horribleone such example is ""I don't make sense."
5878,tt0364986,9141,14,You don't make sense!
5879,tt0364986,9141,15,"I make sense, that's who makes sense!"""
5880,tt0364986,9141,16,"and there so much more wrong with the ""movie"" that I can't write them all down."
5881,tt0364986,9141,17,"However, the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about ""Ben and Arthur"" is that Sam Mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic see his fake reviews for ""Ben & Arthur"" and obvious comments by him on YouTube.."
5882,tt0364986,9141,18,Mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is.
5883,tt0364986,9141,19,"So, to conclude, forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever ""Ben and Arthur"" will knock them right off that title, even Paris Hilton movies look like ""The Dark Knight"" compared to the monstrosity known as ""Ben and Arthur""."
5884,tt0364986,9142,1,Just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself.
5885,tt0364986,9142,2,"Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is, although it has to be one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen!"
5886,tt0364986,9142,3,"Never bothered to post a comment on here before, but this piece of crap really warrants it."
5887,tt0364986,9142,4,Firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical.
5888,tt0364986,9142,5,"Brother of the lead character either Ben or Arthur, I forget which is which, and frankly it's never very clear wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight because homosexuality is abhorrent to Christians, but apparently mass murder isn't."
5889,tt0364986,9142,6,Then there's some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple's ex wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint.
5890,tt0364986,9142,7,"This leads to nothing, but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole ""film"" ""I don't make sense."
5891,tt0364986,9142,8,You don't make sense!
5892,tt0364986,9142,9,"That's who makes sense!""."
5893,tt0364986,9142,10,Brilliant.
5894,tt0364986,9142,11,"Then there's the acting, which is just atrocious."
5895,tt0364986,9142,12,It must be seen to be believed.
5896,tt0364986,9142,13,"My personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman, who is clearly reading her lines off of something, yet still managing to mess them up."
5897,tt0364986,9142,14,Enough said.
5898,tt0364986,9142,15,The gay couple couldn't be less convincing.
5899,tt0364986,9142,16,"There's the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy, and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts."
5900,tt0364986,9142,17,Only fatter.
5901,tt0364986,9142,18,And less talented.
5902,tt0364986,9142,19,"The ""film"" has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still, and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing."
5903,tt0364986,9142,20,The whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on.
5904,tt0364986,9142,21,Yep.
5905,tt0364986,9142,22,"But anyways, we all know how terrible this thing is, so I'd like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the ""film"" provides."
5906,tt0364986,9142,23,When the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape.
5907,tt0364986,9142,24,Hilarious.
5908,tt0364986,9142,25,Mildread!
5909,tt0364986,9142,26,"No idea what relation she is to the main characters sometimes they know her, sometimes they don't, but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless."
5910,tt0364986,9142,27,Hilarious.
5911,tt0364986,9142,28,The stoned lawyer.
5912,tt0364986,9142,29,"Already mentioned her, but she's so funny she's worth another mention."
5913,tt0364986,9142,30,The evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests.
5914,tt0364986,9142,31,The evil brother's anti gay potion.
5915,tt0364986,9142,32,The evil brother's cats.
5916,tt0364986,9142,33,"The ending, which I won't give away because it MUST be seen to be believed."
5917,tt0364986,9142,34,"I warn you though, make sure you're not eating at the time!!!!"
5918,tt0364986,9142,35,The tub of lard main character/director/producer gets naked.
5919,tt0364986,9142,36,It's foul.
5920,tt0364986,9142,37,"Basically, Ben and Arthur is indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most comical thing you'll see for a long time."
5921,tt0364986,9142,38,"Literally, nothing is good about this excuse for a film, the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times."
5922,tt0364986,9143,1,as an actor I really like independent films but this one is amateur at best.
5923,tt0364986,9143,2,The boys go to Vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont.
5924,tt0364986,9143,3,Pines yes palms no.
5925,tt0364986,9143,4,And the same for the wedding service again nice grove of palm trees.
5926,tt0364986,9143,5,When the boys are leaving VT they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is Federal Express.
5927,tt0364986,9143,6,Did they ship themselves Overnight in a crate.
5928,tt0364986,9143,7,Come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur.
5929,tt0364986,9143,8,The Christian brother is far gayer than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo.
5930,tt0364986,9143,9,The two should have switched roles.
5931,tt0364986,9143,10,The minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible.
5932,tt0364986,9143,11,Applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time
5933,tt0364986,9144,1,"This movie is just truly awful, the eye candy that plays Ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this movie."
5934,tt0364986,9144,2,"The writer/director/producer/lead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these times, but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causes."
5935,tt0364986,9144,3,"The script is poor, the casting very ordinary, but the dialogue and acting is just woeful."
5936,tt0364986,9144,4,The homo hating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors I think I've seen more passion in an corn flakes ad.
5937,tt0364986,9144,5,"The acting is stiff, and the dialogue forced a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlight."
5938,tt0364986,9144,6,"I'm just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution, and if he is thinking of doing so, I have some advise JUST DON'T DO IT."
5939,tt0364986,9145,1,"Let me first state that I enjoy watching ""bad"" movies."
5940,tt0364986,9145,2,It's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones.
5941,tt0364986,9145,3,This film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way.
5942,tt0364986,9145,4,"This vehicle for Sam Mraovich's delusional ego doesn't just border on talentless ineptitude, it has redefined the very meaning of the words."
5943,tt0364986,9145,5,This should forever be the barometer for bad movies.
5944,tt0364986,9145,6,Sort of the Mendoza line for film.
5945,tt0364986,9145,7,Mr.
5946,tt0364986,9145,8,"Mraovich writes, directs, and stars as blunt object Arthur Sailes battling scorned wives and the Christian forces of evil as he and his partner Ben ""dead behind the eyes"" Sheets struggle for marital equality."
5947,tt0364986,9145,9,As a libertarian I believe gays should have a right to get married.
5948,tt0364986,9145,10,Ben & Arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes.
5949,tt0364986,9145,11,"The portrayal of all things Christian are so ugly and ham fisted, trademark Mraovich, that you can't possibly take any of them seriously."
5950,tt0364986,9145,12,"Arthur's brother Victor, the bible toting Jesus freak, is so horribly over the top evil/effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role."
5951,tt0364986,9145,13,"That's because Sam ""multitasking"" Mraovich was also casting director."
5952,tt0364986,9145,14,The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself.
5953,tt0364986,9145,15,"When you think leading man do the words pasty, balding, and chubby come to mind."
5954,tt0364986,9145,16,"Sam also delivers lines like domino's pizza, cold and usually wrong."
5955,tt0364986,9145,17,"The final tally: you suck at writing, directing, acting and casting."
5956,tt0364986,9145,18,That's the Ed Wood quadruple crown.
5957,tt0364986,9145,19,Congratulations you horrible little man.
5958,tt0364986,9146,1,Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again.
5959,tt0364986,9146,2,If he does he should be arrested on the spot...at the very least for petty larceny.
5960,tt0364986,9146,3,Anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated.
5961,tt0364986,9146,4,"This was innocently my first viewing of his ""work""...and it will my last."
5962,tt0364986,9146,5,Ed Wood looks awfully good to me right now.
5963,tt0364986,9146,6,"When I return this piece of crap to the video store, I will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf."
5964,tt0364986,9146,7,"An active supporter of gay cinema, I am incensed and angered that this warped, exceedingly untalented man child be allowed to distribute and package something like this, with a coltish pretty boy on the cover Jamie Brett Gabel, who, thankfully, has no other acting credits in IMDb and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait, and then market it as a ""movie"" rental."
5965,tt0364986,9146,8,"Trust me, this has no place being on any rack anywhere; it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word."
5966,tt0364986,9146,9,"Offensive, irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema hell, gay rights in general!"
5967,tt0364986,9146,10,"For those tempting to rent this out because of the cover, you WILL be disappointed."
5968,tt0364986,9146,11,"Gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover, and he appears once or twice without a shirt that's it."
5969,tt0364986,9146,12,"Instead, the homely Mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting, sorry looking dough boy nakedness."
5970,tt0364986,9146,13,"This ""thing"" he ""assembled"" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich."
5971,tt0364986,9146,14,"Both he and his friend Michael Habousch who, I understand, puts out similar sleazy garbage are terrible in this."
5972,tt0364986,9146,15,"Mraovich is purposely posing as a complete no talent in all fields, desperate to grab onto any ""loser"" attention he can for himself."
5973,tt0364986,9146,16,He is to be pitied.
5974,tt0364986,9147,1,"I have no idea what on earth, or beyond, could have possibly made Sam Mraovich believe that this would have been a worthy project to undertake."
5975,tt0364986,9147,2,Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made.
5976,tt0364986,9147,3,"In fact, I see no reason why it should not be at #1 on the Bottom 100."
5977,tt0364986,9147,4,"For although I have not seen, for example, SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 #5 at the time of this publication, I would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound, because even in its vapid dismalness at least Baby Geniuses 2 was professionally made."
5978,tt0364986,9147,5,"By contrast, everything, and I do mean everything, in this film is completely unprofessional."
5979,tt0364986,9147,6,The movie is intended to be an attack on the Christian Right's supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays.
5980,tt0364986,9147,7,"And I do emphasize ""intended."""
5981,tt0364986,9147,8,"Not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose, it also leaves an ugly scar."
5982,tt0364986,9147,9,"Instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple's struggle against a society that largely opposes them, it creates tired, crass stereotypes of each party involved."
5983,tt0364986,9147,10,"Ben and Arthur, the namesake couple, are portrayed as two crude, sex starved, and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so."
5984,tt0364986,9147,11,"This meets with the opposition of Ben's brother Victor, a Christian minister who, like all Christians as this movie would have us believe, is loud, prying, stupid, and violent."
5985,tt0364986,9147,12,He tries to kill Ben and Arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry.
5986,tt0364986,9147,13,Just like in real life.
5987,tt0364986,9147,14,"And if you think that's dreadful it is, you haven't seen it all."
5988,tt0364986,9147,15,The actors . here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a YouTube home comedy video.
5989,tt0364986,9147,16,"But not even Daniel Day Lewis and Marlon Brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker, for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie."
5990,tt0364986,9147,17,Every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote.
5991,tt0364986,9147,18,"For example, in one scene, Victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brother's homosexuality."
5992,tt0364986,9147,19,"But instead of portraying this idea clearly, he spits out the stupid, utterly confusing, whiny sounding line, ""You know what, I'm never going to have any nieces or nephews, okay, because you're so FED UP!"""
5993,tt0364986,9147,20,Even more glaring is the complete lack of production values.
5994,tt0364986,9147,21,"Yes, I know this ain't The Dark Knight, but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing."
5995,tt0364986,9147,22,"For example, six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds."
5996,tt0364986,9147,23,People do not teleport across a room between takes.
5997,tt0364986,9147,24,And objects do not fall FORWARD when shot!
5998,tt0364986,9147,25,Do not waste your money on Ben & Arthur.
5999,tt0364986,9147,26,"I don't care if you're 7, 17, or 107."
6000,tt0364986,9147,27,"I don't care if you're gay, straight, bi, or undecided."
6001,tt0364986,9147,28,"I don't care if you're ""just curious."""
6002,tt0364986,9147,29,I don't care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dung heap.
6003,tt0364986,9147,30,"Stay away, far away."
6004,tt0364986,9147,31,This movie's only redeeming quality is its ability to be used as a Frisbee.
6005,tt0364986,9148,1,"I was looking on Imdbs bottom 100 because i thought id never seen anything as bad as plan 9 from outerspace or Roller Ball remake, I was wrong."
6006,tt0364986,9148,2,Ben and Arthur has beaten both.
6007,tt0364986,9148,3,This out of the many countless amount of movies I've seen is the number one worst film on the i ever saw.
6008,tt0364986,9148,4,"Bad Directing ,Bad Characters ,Horrible Acting ,Horrible story There's a reason nobody but Sam ever says anything positive about this film."
6009,tt0364986,9148,5,Sam was a horrible annoying actor but his directing was so bad he may just overthrow Ed Wood.
6010,tt0364986,9148,6,The Director should be ashamed of his work unfortunately i have to give it at least 1 star but it deserves to be continued stars.
6011,tt0364986,9149,1,There is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent.
6012,tt0364986,9149,2,"Nobody in it has ever tried acting before, even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they've been glued in place."
6013,tt0364986,9149,3,Nothing looks rehearsed.
6014,tt0364986,9149,4,The film quality is terrible.
6015,tt0364986,9149,5,"Most of the 'action' takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought, swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between 'actors' as they deliver their lines."
6016,tt0364986,9149,6,"No tripod and no proper microphone either, there sound quality is terrible."
6017,tt0364986,9149,7,"Even 'Manos' fares better than this, at least they had proper equipment."
6018,tt0364986,9149,8,What plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess.
6019,tt0364986,9149,9,"Stick to home videos, preferably made by some 5 year kid trying out the video feature on daddy's new camera phone."
6020,tt0364986,9149,10,You will be in for a long search to find a movie more inept than this.
6021,tt0364986,9150,1,I made the big mistake of actually watching this whole movie a few nights ago.
6022,tt0364986,9150,2,God I'm still trying to recover.
6023,tt0364986,9150,3,This movie does not even deserve a 1.4 average.
6024,tt0364986,9150,4,IMDb needs to have 0 vote ratings possible for movies that really deserve it like this one.
6025,tt0364986,9150,5,"A 1.4 is TOO HIGH.I had heard how awful this movie was, but I really did not think a movie could actually be that bad, especially in this day and era."
6026,tt0364986,9150,6,I figured all of the cheesy god awful movies were only from the 1950s and 1960s.
6027,tt0364986,9150,7,My god was I wrong.
6028,tt0364986,9150,8,"Trust me folks, this movie REALLY IS THAT BAD."
6029,tt0364986,9150,9,It is beyond horrible; it is beyond pathetic; it is beyond any type of word that I can think of for it.
6030,tt0364986,9150,10,BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like Best Picture of the Year compared to this movie.
6031,tt0364986,9150,11,SNAKE ISLAND which up until now was the worst movie I'd ever seen looks like it deserves a few Oscars compared to this pathetic effort.
6032,tt0364986,9150,12,I seriously can not believe that the makers of this movie thought this was a legitimate serious effort of producing a Hollywood movie.
6033,tt0364986,9150,13,This has no business being called a movie.
6034,tt0364986,9150,14,"In the first 25 seconds of the film, I seriously thought I was watching some high school theater class attempting to make a short movie."
6035,tt0364986,9150,15,"Or better yet, I thought it was some Saturday night Live ripoff skit of the real thing."
6036,tt0364986,9150,16,"I mean, it looks exactly like that."
6037,tt0364986,9150,17,The acting is horrible; the whole movie almost looks like it was shot with a 20 year old VHS video camera. the special effects.......well good lord Bewitched from back in the day had better special effects than this movie.
6038,tt0364986,9150,18,The scene where he gets shot at the door is beyond laughable and beyond cheesy.
6039,tt0364986,9150,19,"I mean seriously, my Intro to Acting class from 4 years ago in college, all of us could have put together a better movie than this."
6040,tt0364986,9150,20,"And the worst part of the entire movie, where Arthur is naked in the bathroom."
6041,tt0364986,9150,21,Oh my god I almost thew up right there.
6042,tt0364986,9150,22,"I have a strong stomach, but wow that was horrible."
6043,tt0364986,9150,23,"Some people should never be naked, and he's one of them."
6044,tt0364986,9150,24,The plot of this movie just seems to go absolutely nowhere.
6045,tt0364986,9150,25,They talk about legal issues that we never hear about again; Ben talks about getting into music that we never hear about again; arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is he's running a porn shop.
6046,tt0364986,9150,26,Everything about the movie is just horrible.
6047,tt0364986,9150,27,"This really doesn't have much to do with my critique, but just so everyone knows, I am not a gay man."
6048,tt0364986,9150,28,I DO however support gay rights and believe we should all be treated as equals.
6049,tt0364986,9150,29,"And I would support any gay person in my church, unlike the cruel priest in this movie, who by the way seems to cuss every other word."
6050,tt0364986,9150,30,WHERE IS THE F#ing white out. hahaha But I didn't want anyone to think I hated this movie just because of it being about two gay guys.
6051,tt0364986,9150,31,It has nothing to do with that: This would have been just as horrible of a movie if it was Ben & Jill instead of Ben & Arthur.
6052,tt0364986,9150,32,I just watched this movie to see if it really was as bad as they say.
6053,tt0364986,9150,33,And yes it was even WORSE than I had read.
6054,tt0364986,9150,34,Let this be a warning to everyone: ONLY watch this movie if you want to just sit back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the 21st century can still be.
6055,tt0364986,9150,35,"If you watch this movie and are actually expecting a good movie or some entertainment, I have no sympathy for you whatsoever."
6056,tt0364986,9150,36,On a final thought: How in the world are there 7 movies ranked BELOW this on IMDb.
6057,tt0364986,9150,37,There is no way there are 7 movies out there that are worse than this!
6058,tt0364986,9151,1,Holy crap this movie was bad.
6059,tt0364986,9151,2,I watched it just as a joke.
6060,tt0364986,9151,3,It isn't even so bad that it's good in an unintentional way.
6061,tt0364986,9151,4,This film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry.
6062,tt0364986,9151,5,It worked really well at doing that.
6063,tt0364986,9151,6,"It's as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie PRIEST, added in a bunch of ugly dudes, took out anything interesting, funny, or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction, and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese."
6064,tt0364986,9151,7,That's all this is.
6065,tt0364986,9151,8,Cheese.
6066,tt0364986,9151,9,There isn't a single person this film could possibly connect to.
6067,tt0364986,9151,10,There isn't any universe this film could possibly take place in.
6068,tt0364986,9151,11,Why can't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy.
6069,tt0364986,9151,12,Why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is.
6070,tt0364986,9151,13,"Why couldn't they at least even tried to make it an okay film, or even a B movie."
6071,tt0364986,9151,14,"Now that I think of it, what they hell were they trying to do with this film."
6072,tt0364986,9151,15,I watched it expecting a campy love story and instead I got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying Christian brother tried to destroy it all!!!
6073,tt0364986,9151,16,"No, I'm not joking."
6074,tt0364986,9151,17,That's what it's about.
6075,tt0364986,9151,18,Does that sound good.
6076,tt0364986,9151,19,"This film is pretty ignorant against people of the Christan religion, with it's stereotyping of all Christians being loudmouthed, rude, and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible."
6077,tt0364986,9151,20,A lot of Christian people I know would never speak or act like these freaks.
6078,tt0364986,9151,21,"The film, however, is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well."
6079,tt0364986,9151,22,These have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that ROADKILL video game.
6080,tt0364986,9151,23,It's so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that I wasn't able to fully pay attention to this film.
6081,tt0364986,9151,24,"The makers of this train wreck had no strategy for set design, acting, camera angles, lighting, script, authenticity, or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting."
6082,tt0364986,9151,25,"There isn't even a single sex scene, or at least not a believable one."
6083,tt0364986,9151,26,"Jamie Brett Gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all, but his good looks were sadly put to waste."
6084,tt0364986,9151,27,This is trash.
6085,tt0364986,9151,28,"In a perfect world, this film would get voted a 0.0."
6086,tt0364986,9151,29,It's worth 0 as a film alone.
6087,tt0364986,9151,30,"A mentally handicapped nun who is blind, deaf, and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write, direct, and produce a better film, and she'd probably be a better actor as well. the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word ""film"" itself."
6088,tt0364986,9151,31,This film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format.
6089,tt0364986,9151,32,I could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x mas tree and then record that and I've already made a film that will always be better than BEN & ARTHUR by at least half.
6090,tt0364986,9151,33,There are only two things worse than death.
6091,tt0364986,9151,34,Torture and watching BEN & ARTHUR.
6092,tt0364986,9151,35,"I'm a homosexual and I will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me, and I don't think I've ever been more offended by an entire film than I was by the first five seconds of this film alone."
6093,tt0364986,9151,36,"If this movie was a mistake, I will personally find a way to change the famous phrase ""It's okay to make mistakes"" to ""It's okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was BEN & ARTHUR."""
6094,tt0364986,9151,37,"You know how people always say things like, ""Good things come out of everything!""."
6095,tt0364986,9151,38,I think that BEN & ARTHUR was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of.
6096,tt0364986,9151,39,To call this movie the worst movie I've ever seen would be giving it WAY too much credit.
6097,tt0364986,9151,40,It's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it's very own.
6098,tt0364986,9151,41,"There are good movies, there are bad movies, and then there's BEN & ARTHUR."
6099,tt0364986,9151,42,This is BEN AND ARTHUR.
6100,tt0364986,9152,1,Intrigued by the synopsis every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it.
6101,tt0364986,9152,2,This is my second and I assure you it will be my last purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video.
6102,tt0364986,9152,3,"As far as I am concerned, this DVD is nothing but a blatant rip off."
6103,tt0364986,9152,4,"I do not make this observation lightly ¬ñ I am a major collector of videos, gay and mainstream, and I can state with some authority and without hesitation that BEN AND ARTHUR is quite simply the worst film I have ever sat through in my life."
6104,tt0364986,9152,5,Period.
6105,tt0364986,9152,6,"My collection boasts over 1,600 films 93% on them on DVD and of those, well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed."
6106,tt0364986,9152,7,"I hardly own every gay movie ever made, but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released, and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film."
6107,tt0364986,9152,8,"Sometimes, this makes for a pleasant surprise Aimee & Jaguar, It's In The Water, Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally."
6108,tt0364986,9152,9,"So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right, one of my favorite subjects, I decided to take the plunge sight unseen, despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title, VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS."
6109,tt0364986,9152,10,"That film was pretty bad, but compared to BEN AND ARTHUR, it viewed like GONE WITH THE WIND."
6110,tt0364986,9152,11,So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR.
6111,tt0364986,9152,12,Plenty!
6112,tt0364986,9152,13,"To begin with, the ""plot"" such as it was, was totally ridiculous."
6113,tt0364986,9152,14,"This film almost made me sympathetic to the Christian Right ¬ñ we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay, but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls like this even makes sense."
6114,tt0364986,9152,15,"The writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all, and several plot points reflect no logic, follow up or connection to the story."
6115,tt0364986,9152,16,"Murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist / right wing conflict on both sides, and the acting is so bad that it's difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired."
6116,tt0364986,9152,17,The characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting.
6117,tt0364986,9152,18,"This film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever, and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves."
6118,tt0364986,9152,19,"The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q Connection purchase, VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS, is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue."
6119,tt0364986,9152,20,"Hardly a distinction, since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is."
6120,tt0364986,9152,21,"It is an embarrassment to Queer culture, and I intend to warn everyone I possibly can before they waste their money on it."
6121,tt0364986,9152,22,"At $9.95 this film would have been way overpriced; I understand that it's soon to be re priced under $20, which is STILL highway robbery."
6122,tt0364986,9152,23,"I paid the original price of $29.95, and I never felt more cheated in my life."
6123,tt0364986,9152,24,"The only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews ¬ñ I have seen ""user reviews"" for this film on numerous websites, and there is always one or two that ""praise"" the director / writer / actor in such a way that it's obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this Ed Wood wannabe."
6124,tt0364986,9152,25,How sad.
6125,tt0364986,9152,26,How desperate.
6126,tt0364986,9152,27,I just wish IMDb would allow you to assign zero stars or even minus zero.
6127,tt0364986,9152,28,"If ever a film deserved it, this is it."
6128,tt0364986,9153,1,"I have never posted a review before, but I had to do it for this film!"
6129,tt0364986,9153,2,"This film is SO bad, I found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody."
6130,tt0364986,9153,3,But it ISN'T.
6131,tt0364986,9153,4,"It is truly, un self consciously BAD."
6132,tt0364986,9153,5,This is a serious attempt that flops gloriously.
6133,tt0364986,9153,6,"Other reviewers have pointed out the film's many flaws, so I'll try not to repeat these, but I do urge you to see this film."
6134,tt0364986,9153,7,"Throughout it I was either speechless, literally gasping with disbelief, or rolling on the floor in hysterics."
6135,tt0364986,9153,8,I haven't had so much fun watching a film in years.
6136,tt0364986,9153,9,"In fact, I'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it's the kind of movie that needs to be shared."
6137,tt0364986,9153,10,"My favorite parts: When Arthur auditions to be a go go boy his dancing is unbelievable The gratuitous nudity the director/leading actor just had to get a nude shot in The preacher's office with its cardboard and crayon rendition of Christ Of course, the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings what narrative function does this play.!."
6138,tt0364986,9153,11,"The ex wife's wrestling match with Ben to get possession of her gun The detailed sequence wherein Arthur kills the preacher; he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match Yes, the gay religious fanatic brother with his bleached hair and WeHo fashions And, my favorite, the use of Joplin's ""The Entertainer"" as the opening soundtrack and ""Pachebel's Canon in D Major"" as the closing soundtrack!"
6139,tt0364986,9153,12,the list goes on and on a MUST SEE!!!
6140,tt0364986,9154,1,THE.
6141,tt0364986,9154,2,WORST.
6142,tt0364986,9154,3,FILM.
6143,tt0364986,9154,4,EVER.
6144,tt0364986,9154,5,"MADE.After watching this supposedly gay made film, I suspect someone rounded up a brain damaged half blind neo nazi and had him make the worst gay film ever, all in some deluded attempt to attack gay culture."
6145,tt0364986,9154,6,"I had to stop the movie and call a friend to come over just so I had someone to scoff at when I paused the movie out of shock, disbelief and outrage at such sheer stupidity."
6146,tt0364986,9154,7,"On top of all the horrible writing and acting and illogical and stupid plot, its just a poorly made film."
6147,tt0364986,9154,8,A dog with a handycam tied to its tail could have churned out better.
6148,tt0364986,9154,9,"Seriously, after reading the few positive reviews this movie has here, I suspect the writer must have a half a dozen IMDb accounts."
6149,tt0364986,9154,10,"Anyone who says this film is even watchable as anything other than a joke, is a liar or being paid heavily to say so."
6150,tt0364986,9155,1,This film was the worst film I have ever viewed.
6151,tt0364986,9155,2,"It was like a ""homework assignment"" for a film class."
6152,tt0364986,9155,3,"It totally misses the mark when it comes to the ""message"" it is TRYING to relay."
6153,tt0364986,9155,4,"Characters are over exaggerated, poor acting and as for a plot...well it is utterly ridiculous."
6154,tt0364986,9155,5,"The cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film, the co actor is handsome and that's about it."
6155,tt0364986,9155,6,Moral of this movie: NEVER JUDGE A MOVIE BY IT'S COVER!
6156,tt0364986,9155,7,"Save your time, money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than I."
6157,tt0364986,9155,8,It was painful to watch and quite frankly I am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and distribute it!
6158,tt0364986,9156,1,Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10.
6159,tt0364986,9156,2,"Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, stared, and produced this movie."
6160,tt0364986,9156,3,"Sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director, and left the acting to somebody who could act. this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production. there was nobody to tell him, ""Sam this is bad, really bad""."
6161,tt0364986,9156,4,"Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was the only good point, but he could have been so much better with a good director, and better actors to work with."
6162,tt0364986,9156,5,"This movie is so bad i think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie twice. the acting and direction was so bad, this movie was turned into a comedy. you just had to laugh, and in the wrong places."
6163,tt0364986,9156,6,A second good point....this would make a great date movie. after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
6164,tt0364986,9157,1,"Your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video, not film."
6165,tt0364986,9157,2,"The story is convoluted, and the production is amazingly sloppy."
6166,tt0364986,9157,3,"Note, for example, that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in Vermont, where they've gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony, the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees."
6167,tt0364986,9157,4,"Their ceremony in Vermont takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palms, which wouldn't last five minutes in the New England climate."
6168,tt0364986,9157,5,"On yet another airplane trip, the establishing shot depicts a FedEx cargo plane taking off."
6169,tt0364986,9157,6,Presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage.
6170,tt0364986,9157,7,"As for the plot, this movie expects you to believe that Victor, the devoutly Christian brother of Arthur, is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his BROTHER is gay."
6171,tt0364986,9157,8,"Not only that, but the pastor eventually sets Victor up with a hit man to have Ben and Arthur killed ""to purge their souls of sin."""
6172,tt0364986,9157,9,Apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments.
6173,tt0364986,9157,10,"Were it not for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all."
6174,tt0364986,9158,1,Oh my GOD.
6175,tt0364986,9158,2,I bought this movie and...
6176,tt0364986,9158,3,I...watched...the...whole...thing. . .
6177,tt0364986,9158,4,"Okay, it's going to be alright..."
6178,tt0364986,9158,5,I'l know I'll be okay in a month or two.
6179,tt0364986,9158,6,Some time soon I hope to be rid of the flash backs.
6180,tt0364986,9158,7,I was going to eat something after the movie but I just can't seem to get up the courage to try and hold any food down at the moment.
6181,tt0364986,9158,8,Bad.
6182,tt0364986,9158,9,Yes bad.
6183,tt0364986,9158,10,Very BAD.
6184,tt0364986,9158,11,BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD.
6185,tt0364986,9158,12,"Wait, bad doesn't seem to get the message across in quite the right way."
6186,tt0364986,9158,13,Hmm...
6187,tt0364986,9158,14,There isn't a word to describe just how awful.... not awful...
6188,tt0364986,9158,15,Hmm disgustingly horribly casted/acted/filmed/directed/written.
6189,tt0364986,9158,16,Now I don't know what to do but throw it out.
6190,tt0364986,9158,17,Possibly burn it I wouldn't want it to end up at the bottom of an architectural dig a thousand years from now.
6191,tt0364986,9158,18,"The worst movie ever since ""Hey Happy"""
6192,tt0364986,9159,1,"If an auteur gives himself 2 credits before the main title and about 15 more credits before the movie starts, and the first shot shows the auteur rolling around on a bed in lycra bike shorts, it won't be a surprise to observe that said auteur has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex."
6193,tt0364986,9159,2,The kind of look that might be useful to a homosexual aversion therapist.
6194,tt0364986,9159,3,Others have given this thing the dishing it deserves.
6195,tt0364986,9159,4,For me the most pitiable moment came when the trip from LA was signified by a plane landing at what appeared to be LAX; and the return was signified by a shot of a Fedex cargo plane.
6196,tt0364986,9160,1,This movie was laughably bad.
6197,tt0364986,9160,2,A friend rented it from Netflix and made me watch it.
6198,tt0364986,9160,3,There are so many gaffes and goofs that it's impossible to even bother getting to know the characters and the plot.
6199,tt0364986,9160,4,How about these for example...
6200,tt0364986,9160,5,"The ""Vermont Airport"" surrounded by palm treesBen's miraculously appearing shirt during a phone conversationThe priest's palatial office... complete with a folding card table deskThere is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie."
6201,tt0364986,9160,6,"But even if you look past the technical flaws, you'll find horrid acting and casting."
6202,tt0364986,9160,7,I was most tickled by the casting of a flamboyantly gay actor to play the right wing religious zealot brother.
6203,tt0364986,9160,8,"His opening scene, sitting in his immaculate apartment, stroking his kitty cat, was hilarious."
6204,tt0364986,9160,9,I applaud the writer/director/producer/editor/star/caterer/cast dentist/composer and whatever else he did on this move for actually getting a movie like this distributed.
6205,tt0364986,9160,10,"If you have nothing better to do, it could be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking game but don't rent it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage."
6206,tt0364986,9161,1,"...well, pop this into the DVD, waste an hour and a half of your life that you will never get back, and find out."
6207,tt0364986,9161,2,Acting.
6208,tt0364986,9161,3,What acting.
6209,tt0364986,9161,4,Production values. ...
6210,tt0364986,9161,5,Production. ...
6211,tt0364986,9161,6,Values.
6212,tt0364986,9161,7,Story.
6213,tt0364986,9161,8,Don't get me started.
6214,tt0364986,9161,9,"After many years of posting on IMDb, I never thought I would see a film so bad that I truly wished for a lower rating than one."
6215,tt0364986,9161,10,"I always have found at least a reason or two to see merit if only in the intent or the effort of the writer, the director, the cast, or the producer."
6216,tt0364986,9161,11,"In this case, they're all the same guy !"
6217,tt0364986,9161,12,"who really needs to get a handle on the fact, at least as demonstrated by this worthless waste of video tape, that he has no talent."
6218,tt0364986,9161,13,"I mean it would be a reasonable excuse if this were some junior high schooler's ""production"" for his first cinema class, but the referenced ""artist"" behind this dreck was twenty six at the time of this miscarriage."
6219,tt0364986,9161,14,Just how did this ever get made.
6220,tt0364986,9161,15,Who in their right mind ever wrote a check for this.
6221,tt0364986,9161,16,"Moreover, don't let the box cover fool you: there's not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good ""exposure"" of the hunk on that cover."
6222,tt0364986,9161,17,"Two final items: there was one second when this ""film"" had redeeming value: the aforementioned ""talent"" gets roundly punched out by his lover."
6223,tt0364986,9161,18,I cheered!
6224,tt0364986,9161,19,"And, I did learn one thing from this ""film.""."
6225,tt0364986,9161,20,"There are times when something is so very bad that it is, indeed, truly very funny."
6226,tt0364986,9161,21,But not in any comical manner; it's just sadly humorous.
6227,tt0364986,9161,22,Very sadly humorous.
6228,tt0369226,7650,1,"I know I'm in the minority, but..."
6229,tt0369226,7650,2,Uwe Boll is about as talented as a frog.
6230,tt0369226,7650,3,Not even a toad; just a frog.
6231,tt0369226,7650,4,He's reminiscent of about a hundred other no talent hacks who churn out one useless crap fest after another.
6232,tt0369226,7650,5,This movie.
6233,tt0369226,7650,6,Is a crap fest.
6234,tt0369226,7650,7,Slater's talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe he's got other things like his failed relationship on his mind.
6235,tt0369226,7650,8,"Reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons, been severely hit on the head and MADE to forget her acting lessons, or has one of the worst directors in the history of film."
6236,tt0369226,7650,9,"I'm voting on the third choice, myself, although the other two are always possible."
6237,tt0369226,7650,10,Uwe Boll has never done a single thing from which I've derived even the slightest pleasure.
6238,tt0369226,7650,11,"Frankly, I'm satisfied that he made this stinker."
6239,tt0369226,7650,12,"I was concerned with Bloodrayne competing with ""Underworld: Evolution"" for ticket sales."
6240,tt0369226,7650,13,"Now, I'm confident that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean NOTHING, to worry about."
6241,tt0369226,7650,14,"This rates a 1.0/10 rating for this messy, convoluted crap fest, from...the Fiend :."
6242,tt0369226,7651,1,It should come as no shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie.
6243,tt0369226,7651,2,"To put it bluntly, it's as if a dung monster defecated, ate the result, and then vomited."
6244,tt0369226,7651,3,The final product would still outshine this movie.
6245,tt0369226,7651,4,Seemingly based on an ancient !
6246,tt0369226,7651,5,"Atari video game, the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of demons, and ancient civilizations."
6247,tt0369226,7651,6,"Something about there being two worlds, that of darkness and that of light."
6248,tt0369226,7651,7,Guess which one's ours.
6249,tt0369226,7651,8,"Oh, and 10,000 years ago a really super duper advanced civilization opened the portal, demons came over and had a blast, then wiped out the civilization."
6250,tt0369226,7651,9,"Which is why we've never heard of them, conveniently enough."
6251,tt0369226,7651,10,"Christian Slater, perhaps pining for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher to whom Something Bad happened when he was 10 years old."
6252,tt0369226,7651,11,He's hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization.
6253,tt0369226,7651,12,"Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long ago civilization."
6254,tt0369226,7651,13,"But Carnby believed he wasn't going to be able to find the answers he sought, so he left the group."
6255,tt0369226,7651,14,"But see, these beasties are out, and they get their prey in varying ways, such as gutting them, splitting them down the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or just turning them into killing zombies."
6256,tt0369226,7651,15,"Yes, it's another zombie movie."
6257,tt0369226,7651,16,That's about as distilled I can make the plot.
6258,tt0369226,7651,17,It's pretty convoluted and incomprehensible.
6259,tt0369226,7651,18,"In similar movies, one might see the intrepid researcher/adventurer figure things out a step at a time, and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher, it's a lot of fun."
6260,tt0369226,7651,19,But when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context... not so much fun.
6261,tt0369226,7651,20,"The acting is dreadful, save for Slater, who although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie showed he was capable of carrying the acting load."
6262,tt0369226,7651,21,He had to; get this Tara Reid is cast as a museum curator!
6263,tt0369226,7651,22,"Honest to goodness, I thought I'd seen the casting of a lifetime when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies."
6264,tt0369226,7651,23,"But Reid here matches Richards, crappy emoting for crappy emoting."
6265,tt0369226,7651,24,"Hightlights include Reid pronouncing ""Newfoundland"" as ""New Fownd Land,"" Reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed, throaty monotone kinda like she'd been on an all night bender for the past week before filming, Reid a museum curator, mind you spending a lot of the movie in a midriff bearing top and hip hugger jeans."
6266,tt0369226,7651,25,"Oh yeah, she was as believable as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes."
6267,tt0369226,7651,26,"Oh, why must the pretty ones be so dumb."
6268,tt0369226,7651,27,Note: I don't think Tara Reid's all that good looking.
6269,tt0369226,7651,28,She looks like she's in perpetual need of food.
6270,tt0369226,7651,29,"Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable, except perhaps for Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders of 713."
6271,tt0369226,7651,30,"Dorff's character wasn't terribly well developed, but nothing in the movie was, from the sets to the characters to Tara Reid."
6272,tt0369226,7651,31,But I digress.
6273,tt0369226,7651,32,"Anyway, the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace, but director Uwe Boll tosses in a pounding, mind deadening soundtrack; it's so loud you can't hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes!"
6274,tt0369226,7651,33,That can't be right.
6275,tt0369226,7651,34,"Given the acting level, however, perhaps thanks are in order to Mr."
6276,tt0369226,7651,35,Boll.
6277,tt0369226,7651,36,"Oh, and a fun note."
6278,tt0369226,7651,37,The opening moments of the movie include narration... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time.
6279,tt0369226,7651,38,Remember the first Star Wars.
6280,tt0369226,7651,39,You heard that now familiar Star Wars theme while the prologue crawled.
6281,tt0369226,7651,40,There was surely no need for narration; why do I need some doofus to read what's on the screen for me.
6282,tt0369226,7651,41,Were the producers simply looking out for blind people.
6283,tt0369226,7651,42,Maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud they were also looking out for hard of hearing people.
6284,tt0369226,7651,43,"Also, the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl then lost it."
6285,tt0369226,7651,44,Bizarre.
6286,tt0369226,7651,45,"Alone in the Dark is a loud, dopey mishmash of dreadful acting, an incoherent script, and ham handed directing."
6287,tt0369226,7651,46,Hardly a note rings true.
6288,tt0369226,7651,47,There's so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise.
6289,tt0369226,7651,48,"Even in the dark, the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison."
6290,tt0369226,7651,49,"Ironically, since there were only three other people in the theater, I watched this Alone in the Dark."
6291,tt0369226,7651,50,I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way.
6292,tt0369226,7651,51,"I can't quite give this the lowest rating, because I had low hopes for it to begin with and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it."
6293,tt0369226,7651,52,"It's atrocious, although Slater redeems himself a tiny bit."
6294,tt0369226,7652,1,"In 1967, mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named Abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness."
6295,tt0369226,7652,2,"When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed."
6296,tt0369226,7652,3,"Twenty two years ago, the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens Matthew Walker, who performed experiments with orphan children."
6297,tt0369226,7652,4,"On the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby Christian Slater, who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America, and is chased by a man with abilities."
6298,tt0369226,7652,5,"When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth."
6299,tt0369226,7652,6,"With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac Tara Reid and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr."
6300,tt0369226,7652,7,"Richard Burke Stephen Dorff, and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures."
6301,tt0369226,7652,8,"In spite of having a charismatic good cast, leaded by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, ""Alone in the Dark"" never works and is a complete mess, without development of characters or plot."
6302,tt0369226,7652,9,"The reason may be explained by the ""brilliant"" interview of director Uwe Boll in the Extras of the DVD, where he says that ""videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore""."
6303,tt0369226,7652,10,"Further, his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty five years old."
6304,tt0369226,7652,11,"Sorry, but I find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations."
6305,tt0369226,7652,12,"I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says."
6306,tt0369226,7652,13,"Further, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr."
6307,tt0369226,7652,14,Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong.
6308,tt0369226,7652,15,My vote is three.
6309,tt0369226,7652,16,"Title Brazil: ""Alone in the Dark ¬ñ O Despertar do Mal"" ""Alone in the Dark ¬ñ The Awakening of the Evil"""
6310,tt0369226,7653,1,"First off I'd like to say that if I had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10, then I'd give it a 4."
6311,tt0369226,7653,2,"It's not that I'm a tough critic, it's just that this movie is THAT bad."
6312,tt0369226,7653,3,"Everything from the story, to the directing, to the editing is awful."
6313,tt0369226,7653,4,"The story is not even halfway decent to begin with you can't expect much since it is based on a video game, something I was not aware of going into the movie but the directing and editing made it even worse."
6314,tt0369226,7653,5,"The movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones; some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, don't even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don't show any feelings toward each other."
6315,tt0369226,7653,6,You could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'd still be disappointed.
6316,tt0369226,7653,7,"Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money, and if you don't pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life."
6317,tt0369226,7653,8,So do yourself a favor and don't watch it.
6318,tt0369226,7654,1,"I remember reading all the horrible, horrible reviews for this film when it came out."
6319,tt0369226,7654,2,I meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks.
6320,tt0369226,7654,3,The only other movie to manage that is Gigli.
6321,tt0369226,7654,4,"When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it was."
6322,tt0369226,7654,5,I couldn't think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible.
6323,tt0369226,7654,6,"After seeing it, I can understand."
6324,tt0369226,7654,7,"First off, let me say that this film is not without some cool shots."
6325,tt0369226,7654,8,"There's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun, which I thought was neat."
6326,tt0369226,7654,9,And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it.
6327,tt0369226,7654,10,Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid.
6328,tt0369226,7654,11,"If bad acting was a sin, then Hell would've chucked Tara Reid right out since she's so unbelievably awful in this movie it's unthinkable."
6329,tt0369226,7654,12,"And of all the roles, she plays a curator."
6330,tt0369226,7654,13,"Now if she played a dumb, empty headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character."
6331,tt0369226,7654,14,"Apparently, Uwe Boll didn't realize that, although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie, people would see it."
6332,tt0369226,7654,15,He just didn't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad.
6333,tt0369226,7654,16,And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping.
6334,tt0369226,7654,17,I couldn't tell.
6335,tt0369226,7654,18,Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you'll ever see in a movie.
6336,tt0369226,7654,19,"I mean, I'd give House of the Dead an F and I only do that for very few movies but HotD would score at least a B compared to this screwed up piece of junk."
6337,tt0369226,7654,20,"The movie starts off with a very, very long narration that causes immediate confusion and read by a horrible narrator and from there, the cuts are really, really dumb."
6338,tt0369226,7654,21,There's this one point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that's been destroyed and the screen blackens out.
6339,tt0369226,7654,22,"When it comes back, Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly, an entire army has joined them."
6340,tt0369226,7654,23,Huh.
6341,tt0369226,7654,24,And someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie.
6342,tt0369226,7654,25,"At one point, a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it."
6343,tt0369226,7654,26,"Tara Reid's earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater walks away from a dead comrade, you can see her begin to get up."
6344,tt0369226,7654,27,As for the story...
6345,tt0369226,7654,28,I was really lost.
6346,tt0369226,7654,29,"Something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone ""opens the path"" or something and all the evil monsters pop out."
6347,tt0369226,7654,30,"It's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film that get, quite simply, BORING."
6348,tt0369226,7654,31,I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was.
6349,tt0369226,7654,32,"I didn't laugh, but I still think it's stupid."
6350,tt0369226,7654,33,"Very, very, very stupid."
6351,tt0369226,7655,1,We should all congratulate Uwe Boll.
6352,tt0369226,7655,2,He's done the unthinkable.
6353,tt0369226,7655,3,He may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on IMDb!
6354,tt0369226,7655,4,He's like some kind of cinematic cockroach.
6355,tt0369226,7655,5,"No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these movies are, he manages to keep making them."
6356,tt0369226,7655,6,"I know, he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute, complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe."
6357,tt0369226,7655,7,It wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy.
6358,tt0369226,7655,8,I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games.
6359,tt0369226,7655,9,"Even the latest one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of game play."
6360,tt0369226,7655,10,"There was a good movie to be made out of Edward Carnby's adventures, but this is not it."
6361,tt0369226,7655,11,Now Uwe Boll has gotten his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning.
6362,tt0369226,7655,12,"What's next, Silent Hill."
6363,tt0369226,7655,13,Doom.
6364,tt0369226,7655,14,I can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game to movie adaptations if he's not stopped.
6365,tt0369226,7655,15,"Someone needs to take away his line of credit, or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title any more."
6366,tt0369226,7655,16,"Think about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore."
6367,tt0369226,7655,17,No way.
6368,tt0369226,7655,18,A new House of the Dead game comes out for X Box and nobody's gonna care.
6369,tt0369226,7655,19,"The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll."
6370,tt0369226,7655,20,"So if any of you out there work for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher... please warn them."
6371,tt0369226,7655,21,This movie itself is not even worth reviewing.
6372,tt0369226,7655,22,I can't separate what I didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it.
6373,tt0369226,7655,23,"Literally, everything about it sucks."
6374,tt0369226,7655,24,"The writing, the acting, the music, the CG effects, the editing."
6375,tt0369226,7655,25,"I thought that if I waited until it came out on DVD and then rented it with low expectations, I wouldn't be disappointed."
6376,tt0369226,7655,26,"Boy, was I wrong."
6377,tt0369226,7655,27,"Never underestimate Uwe's ability to turn out a big, steaming pile of BOLL sht."
6378,tt0369226,7656,1,Alone in The Dark is one of my favorite role playing games of all time.
6379,tt0369226,7656,2,"I remember spending whole nights facing the PC screen, trying to escape that mansion and actually being startled at times when monsters came surprisingly charging in."
6380,tt0369226,7656,3,"Now, mind you I am weary of ""computer game generated"" movies."
6381,tt0369226,7656,4,"I don't remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre, although some are entertaining enough to be watchable."
6382,tt0369226,7656,5,"And yet, I am such a big fan of the game that I couldn't resist."
6383,tt0369226,7656,6,"My rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the game's, it would be OK."
6384,tt0369226,7656,7,"Man, those were 90 minutes which seemed like 300 of my life that I'll never get back."
6385,tt0369226,7656,8,"If I had that chance, I would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead."
6386,tt0369226,7656,9,"This isn't even in the ""so bad it's funny"" category."
6387,tt0369226,7656,10,You would think even Christian Slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb.
6388,tt0369226,7656,11,"Now, Tara Reid..."
6389,tt0369226,7656,12,I'm not complaining about her presence.
6390,tt0369226,7656,13,"However, if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene, which I totally understand and support hey, I'm a guy!"
6391,tt0369226,7656,14,I've seen more of her body on press conferences.
6392,tt0369226,7656,15,There is no plot to speak of.
6393,tt0369226,7656,16,Won't waste your time pitching it to you.
6394,tt0369226,7656,17,The credibility of the story sinks below 'I did not have sex with Ms.
6395,tt0369226,7656,18,Lewinski'.
6396,tt0369226,7656,19,"The acting is but a few notches above 'Street Fighter', which, by the way, being one of the worst movies I've seen, I would recommend OVER this one."
6397,tt0369226,7656,20,"Kids, I recommend the Video Game."
6398,tt0369226,7656,21,"It has far better story, acting and much more thrills."
6399,tt0369226,7656,22,"As for the movie, here's a spoiler it STINKS!"
6400,tt0369226,7656,23,Wait for the porno version.
6401,tt0369226,7657,1,"There should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible."
6402,tt0369226,7657,2,"RE was a survival horror game, and a damn effective one at that, yet Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along."
6403,tt0369226,7657,3,"Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as Resident Evil, so of course, there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie."
6404,tt0369226,7657,4,"Instead, Alone in the Dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies."
6405,tt0369226,7657,5,"The plot, despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter, is the largest of many problems with the movie."
6406,tt0369226,7657,6,"The movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important, as after a minute passes, the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them."
6407,tt0369226,7657,7,"Then there's something about an orphanage, some artefacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on."
6408,tt0369226,7657,8,"Characters move in and out of the plot like candy, some having huge build ups for meaningless deaths."
6409,tt0369226,7657,9,"Basically, what I can understand is that some demons got released, and Edward Carnby Slater has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him."
6410,tt0369226,7657,10,"He finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an ex girlfriend anthropologist Reid, who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason."
6411,tt0369226,7657,11,"Then, out of nowhere, all hell breaks loose, and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander Dorff, who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby."
6412,tt0369226,7657,12,"It's all ridiculous, and the reason I don't really understand it isn't just because it's complicated and jumbled, but it leaves no room for anyone to really care."
6413,tt0369226,7657,13,"Instead, I highly recommend that, if you must see this film, bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion."
6414,tt0369226,7657,14,"The action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little, right."
6415,tt0369226,7657,15,"Too bad, this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made, with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens."
6416,tt0369226,7657,16,"Considering that this is based on a horror game, not an action game, it is especially annoying."
6417,tt0369226,7657,17,"The first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst I have ever had to witness, and the rest isn't all that great either."
6418,tt0369226,7657,18,"The demons look somewhat cool, though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect."
6419,tt0369226,7657,19,Scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict.
6420,tt0369226,7657,20,It's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night.
6421,tt0369226,7657,21,The acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing.
6422,tt0369226,7657,22,"Slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie, though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on."
6423,tt0369226,7657,23,"The same is true of Dorff, who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot."
6424,tt0369226,7657,24,"Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be, background sex appeal, as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning."
6425,tt0369226,7657,25,"In all, this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies."
6426,tt0369226,7657,26,"If they keep ruining the spirit like this, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing Middle Easterns with an AK 47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens."
6427,tt0369226,7657,27,"Unlike Resident Evil, however, this one doesn't deserve a second chance, as I don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is."
6428,tt0369226,7657,28,"It's bland, uninteresting and unexciting."
6429,tt0369226,7657,29,"This is the movie equivalent of diarrhea; it's all thrown together, nothing really fits and, in the end, you're just glad it's over."
6430,tt0369226,7657,30,TOTAL: 4%
6431,tt0369226,7658,1,Alone in the Dark is Uwe Boll's kick in the nuts to Hollywood after House of the Dead's punch in the face.
6432,tt0369226,7658,2,If anything it proves just how much of a master manipulator Boll is.
6433,tt0369226,7658,3,"After forcing Artisan out of business over the flop that was House of the Dead, one can only assume the normally credible Lion's Gate Films only released AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisan's assets."
6434,tt0369226,7658,4,"Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film making ability, plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movie's framework."
6435,tt0369226,7658,5,"But then that's the point, isn't it."
6436,tt0369226,7658,6,Boll isn't trying to make a coherent film because he isn't trying to direct Alone in the Dark.
6437,tt0369226,7658,7,He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood.
6438,tt0369226,7658,8,"Alone in the Dark, like House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are ""announced"" or in ""pre production""."
6439,tt0369226,7658,9,"These aren't movies to be directed, but investment portfolios."
6440,tt0369226,7658,10,Every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law Boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years.
6441,tt0369226,7658,11,"The more bomb projects he can release within that time frame, the more money he and his investors can gain."
6442,tt0369226,7658,12,Why bother making a good movie when a bad movie's making you a mint anyway.
6443,tt0369226,7658,13,The result is movies like the awfulness of Alone in the Dark.
6444,tt0369226,7658,14,"Alone in the Dark, like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current trend for lazy film making."
6445,tt0369226,7658,15,"And to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood, congratulations, by making a cult figure out of the man, you're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety."
6446,tt0369226,7658,16,"For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php.id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php.s=&threadid=21699 As an aside, just don't ask me how he's getting his cast lists together."
6447,tt0369226,7658,17,"Unless the actors are in on the investment scam somehow, that mystery has still to be uncovered."
6448,tt0369226,7659,1,Alone In The Dark is one BAD movie and tied with Deuce Bigalow for worst movie of the year.
6449,tt0369226,7659,2,I wish that was ALL I had to say but of course the IMDb stipulates a word count and all that.
6450,tt0369226,7659,3,I'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie.
6451,tt0369226,7659,4,"A low budget dreck like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos."
6452,tt0369226,7659,5,"Or a huge budget disgrace like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff."
6453,tt0369226,7659,6,You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos happen because the director hasn't a clue.
6454,tt0369226,7659,7,"Movies like this happen because the director is a stupid, money grabbing idiot who simply doesn't care about his audience."
6455,tt0369226,7659,8,It's more shocking when you consider that Uwe Boll The mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt has created something that only happens once in a blue moon.
6456,tt0369226,7659,9,The really terribly bad horror film.
6457,tt0369226,7659,10,Everything about it is a mess.
6458,tt0369226,7659,11,"Cheesy CGI, bad plot, insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack."
6459,tt0369226,7659,12,Alone In The Dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody.
6460,tt0369226,7659,13,Woo hoo!
6461,tt0369226,7659,14,Review over.
6462,tt0369226,7659,15,"Give me a bud, roll on 2006 and may I NEVER speak of this again."
6463,tt0369226,7659,16,Don't watch this film.
6464,tt0369226,7660,1,"0's Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C."
6465,tt0369226,7660,2,"Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson."
6466,tt0369226,7660,3,Directed by Uwe Boll.
6467,tt0369226,7660,4,Based on the video game director Uwe Boll attempts to recreate the game into an action packed nail biter sadly he doesn't succeed.
6468,tt0369226,7660,5,Instead he makes one of the worst movies ever MADE!
6469,tt0369226,7660,6,"Even though he gets minor celebrity such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line, and some basic relativity of what's going on in the dark and the light."
6470,tt0369226,7660,7,The movie bounces all around and Uwe Boll has no creative control.
6471,tt0369226,7660,8,And not to mention the bad CGI used on making the monsters.
6472,tt0369226,7660,9,"Even though they did look cool and the feedings were well, a little lame."
6473,tt0369226,7660,10,Honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made.
6474,tt0369226,7660,11,My final rating 0/10.
6475,tt0369226,7661,1,The title of worse film of all time is one that gets handed out quickly and often.
6476,tt0369226,7661,2,"Most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of real candidates: Plan 9 from Outer Space, Battlefield Earth, and the Adventures of Pluto Nash."
6477,tt0369226,7661,3,As I watched the 90 minute bore I found it difficult to even stay awake even while I was trying so hard to laugh at the film.
6478,tt0369226,7661,4,But alas I felt alone in the dark I was gonna try to avoid the pun but I couldn't resist as I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends.
6479,tt0369226,7661,5,Alas my friends and I had to provide comedy throughout the film.
6480,tt0369226,7661,6,So... about the film itself.
6481,tt0369226,7661,7,Lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film.
6482,tt0369226,7661,8,"The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xenos in Aliens they even call them Xenos, and the creatures in Pitch Black."
6483,tt0369226,7661,9,The can turn invisible at random and I assure you it is random and get hurt by light.
6484,tt0369226,7661,10,Also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something resembling a zombie.
6485,tt0369226,7661,11,All of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997.
6486,tt0369226,7661,12,The action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow.
6487,tt0369226,7661,13,People shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post.
6488,tt0369226,7661,14,Light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your pupils burn from overwork while bad rock music blares in the background.
6489,tt0369226,7661,15,And those were the high points.
6490,tt0369226,7661,16,The story revolving around a paranormal investigator Slater whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife beater Tshirt with a trench coat and not shaving for 2 days.
6491,tt0369226,7661,17,An archaeologist Reid who is rather inept.
6492,tt0369226,7661,18,And a government agentDorff whose lines involve barking order.
6493,tt0369226,7661,19,All three should be ashamed at their performances not that they have really ever done a good a job before and the casting director should be ashamed.
6494,tt0369226,7661,20,Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers in the film I guess.
6495,tt0369226,7661,21,The film contains the single most awkward love scene I have ever seen on film between the two.
6496,tt0369226,7661,22,Then comes the plot.
6497,tt0369226,7661,23,Quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all.
6498,tt0369226,7661,24,The rest is illogical at best.
6499,tt0369226,7661,25,The plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars.
6500,tt0369226,7661,26,The film begins with text and a voice explaining the back story.
6501,tt0369226,7661,27,This opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible.
6502,tt0369226,7661,28,This opening narration is later repeated adnausem in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film.
6503,tt0369226,7661,29,And the ending did not make one ounce of sense.
6504,tt0369226,7661,30,"Not only did it not make sense in the world of the film, it simply did not make sense."
6505,tt0369226,7661,31,Finally the direction of one Uwe Boll.
6506,tt0369226,7661,32,"Disgrace, thats all that can be said."
6507,tt0369226,7661,33,His use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense.
6508,tt0369226,7661,34,His lack of direction with the actors.
6509,tt0369226,7661,35,Just watch Reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot.
6510,tt0369226,7661,36,The complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects.
6511,tt0369226,7661,37,And finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers.
6512,tt0369226,7661,38,I payed a $1.50 to see this show at a second run theater.
6513,tt0369226,7661,39,And while the laughs me and my friends provided made it worth every quarter I would advise people to avoid paying any more for this film.
6514,tt0369226,7661,40,Grab about 3 friends and split the rental cost and tear this movie a new one.
6515,tt0369226,7661,41,Shame on you Uwe Boll.
6516,tt0369226,7661,42,Shame on you Tara Reid.
6517,tt0369226,7661,43,Shame on you Christian Slater.
6518,tt0369226,7661,44,Shame on you Stephen Dorff.
6519,tt0369226,7661,45,Shame on anyone who was associated with this film.
6520,tt0369226,7662,1,This should be my kind of movie.
6521,tt0369226,7662,2,"Even if it sucked, it still should have been right up my alley; hell, I like ""Congo,"" and ""Allan Quatermaine"" movies."
6522,tt0369226,7662,3,I have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies.
6523,tt0369226,7662,4,Let's go over why I decided to watch this in the first place.1.
6524,tt0369226,7662,5,Horror/Sci fi almost always intrigues me 2.
6525,tt0369226,7662,6,"I'm a big fan of archaeology, and this movie does involve a rare treasure."
6526,tt0369226,7662,7,3
6527,tt0369226,7662,8,Super natural enemies with quality FX.
6528,tt0369226,7662,9,4
6529,tt0369226,7662,10,Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy.
6530,tt0369226,7662,11,5
6531,tt0369226,7662,12,Tara Reid is hot.
6532,tt0369226,7662,13,"So this movie had potential, at least in the cheese horror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass."
6533,tt0369226,7662,14,"The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do..."
6534,tt0369226,7662,15,"I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic."
6535,tt0369226,7662,16,But now on to some of the many faults.
6536,tt0369226,7662,17,Tara Reid.
6537,tt0369226,7662,18,"Even though the movie as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is truly awful."
6538,tt0369226,7662,19,"We're not just talking bad, I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for worst performance of the year."
6539,tt0369226,7662,20,"I don't know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely."
6540,tt0369226,7662,21,Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn.
6541,tt0369226,7662,22,"I mean this isn't just bad, it is laughably bad."
6542,tt0369226,7662,23,"Oh, and for those of you curious, she doesn't get naked, only down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene."
6543,tt0369226,7662,24,"Even with Reid's performance, perhaps the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10 year old."
6544,tt0369226,7662,25,"I hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watching the DVD, otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real time."
6545,tt0369226,7662,26,"The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course."
6546,tt0369226,7662,27,"In his adult life Slater was recruited by some Unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something."
6547,tt0369226,7662,28,"Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess, you never really know unless it was in one of those voice overs I zoned out during."
6548,tt0369226,7662,29,"The movie starts with Slater hunting artifacts, obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a ""Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities."""
6549,tt0369226,7662,30,"I may have the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea."
6550,tt0369226,7662,31,"There is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth no reason given, experiments on children, super demon/alien human hybrids, ""photonic"" bullets the demon things can't stand sunlight and, of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone."
6551,tt0369226,7662,32,"Jesus, I can't even being to wade through the clich√©d elements."
6552,tt0369226,7662,33,The script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth.
6553,tt0369226,7662,34,"I mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil."
6554,tt0369226,7662,35,"Oh right, humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race."
6555,tt0369226,7662,36,I guess he's infected.
6556,tt0369226,7662,37,How did that happen.
6557,tt0369226,7662,38,Oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself.
6558,tt0369226,7662,39,How the hell did that happen.
6559,tt0369226,7662,40,"Why and where did he get the super slugs oh yes, they use the old sci fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which ""fuse"" with the spine of their hostOf course, Slater is, like Blade, half super slug powered, but his slug ""didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock,"" thank god."
6560,tt0369226,7662,41,"Oh, and the people with these ""fused"" spines, have no idea they're half alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies."
6561,tt0369226,7662,42,Yeah we get zombies.
6562,tt0369226,7662,43,"So lots of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is."
6563,tt0369226,7662,44,"Also, the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle."
6564,tt0369226,7662,45,"Not the very worst thing you'll see, but a truly bad movie."
6565,tt0369226,7663,1,"Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slaterusually great as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as...well it's STEPHEN DORFF FOR Christ SAKE!!!!"
6566,tt0369226,7663,2,I personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort.
6567,tt0369226,7663,3,You guys are on.
6568,tt0369226,7663,4,"Heres an idea, just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices,a movie about the most brilliant neuro physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this, heres the clincher they have to be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton."
6569,tt0369226,7663,5,I knew you guys would love that.
6570,tt0369226,7663,6,Seriously though you owe me $7.50.
6571,tt0369226,7664,1,"Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter."
6572,tt0369226,7664,2,Have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions.
6573,tt0369226,7664,3,Could this be it.
6574,tt0369226,7664,4,Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world.
6575,tt0369226,7664,5,Why is this question never answered.
6576,tt0369226,7664,6,Why was the opening text crawl incoherent.
6577,tt0369226,7664,7,Why would a nun she sure seemed nice!
6578,tt0369226,7664,8,hand over 20 orphans to a madman.
6579,tt0369226,7664,9,Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver.
6580,tt0369226,7664,10,Why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage.
6581,tt0369226,7664,11,Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for sex.
6582,tt0369226,7664,12,Or did I just answer my own question.
6583,tt0369226,7664,13,Why would even a non archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer.
6584,tt0369226,7664,14,"Why would modern computers still display green pre Tron era grid outlines of objects, complete with little ""bleeps""."
6585,tt0369226,7664,15,And must all movie explosive timers have digital displays.
6586,tt0369226,7664,16,Why doesn't ANYTHING in this movie make any sense.
6587,tt0369226,7665,1,"Honestly, I can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence life is simply too short."
6588,tt0369226,7665,2,"What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark succeeds in only three things: 1."
6589,tt0369226,7665,3,"It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons."
6590,tt0369226,7665,4,2
6591,tt0369226,7665,5,It manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of them.and3.
6592,tt0369226,7665,6,It utterly disgraces the classic PC game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film making.
6593,tt0369226,7665,7,"Doctor Boll, if that is indeed what you are I'm thinking proctology here, what on Earth are you doing in a director's chair."
6594,tt0369226,7666,1,"I usually start by relaying the premise of the film, but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review, let me preface it by saying that I'm someone who likes most films just check my other reviews."
6595,tt0369226,7666,2,"Alone in the Dark is a film by director Uwe Boll, whose film right before this one was House of the Dead 2003."
6596,tt0369226,7666,3,"Like Alone in the Dark, it was also a film adaptation of a video game."
6597,tt0369226,7666,4,Almost everyone hated it.
6598,tt0369226,7666,5,"Well, I loved it."
6599,tt0369226,7666,6,I even gave it a 10 out of 10!
6600,tt0369226,7666,7,"My point in stating this which will surely turn some readers off immediately is that if even I hated Alone in the Dark, there must be something wrong with it."
6601,tt0369226,7666,8,The Premise: Who am I kidding.
6602,tt0369226,7666,9,"Attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the United States' budget, but here it goes anyway."
6603,tt0369226,7666,10,Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe.
6604,tt0369226,7666,11,"The Indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the ""second world"", which was evil in nature."
6605,tt0369226,7666,12,"The bad stuff wiped them out, but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key."
6606,tt0369226,7666,13,"Later, some scientist/government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal, and specifically this tribe, decided to experiment on some kids, to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world."
6607,tt0369226,7666,14,Believe it or not everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film it's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice over also reading it to us.
6608,tt0369226,7666,15,"Then, there was something about the kids being in an orphanage, but the government takes them back out, and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics, and there are super humans roaming around, and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on."
6609,tt0369226,7666,16,"In fact, the exposition never really stops."
6610,tt0369226,7666,17,It's like a neverending backstory from hell.
6611,tt0369226,7666,18,"There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films, maybe 25."
6612,tt0369226,7666,19,But not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film.
6613,tt0369226,7666,20,"In addition to the mystical lost Indian tribe and the superhumans, we also get monsters that resemble a cross between Alien and a werewolf, worms that invade your body and turn into snake like aliens, tunneling worms underground, zombies, Starship Trooper like wars, evil scientists, underground lairs, gold mines, spooky warehouses, impalements, big mostly unused museums, government conspiracies, golden trunks pulled out of the sea, nuns, explosions, complex backstabbing plots, a very ambiguous romance, car chases, home invasions, kitchen sinks . . . wait, I can't remember if that last one was in the film."
6614,tt0369226,7666,21,"Even more amazingly amusingly., in Fangoria #240, producer Shawn Williamson was quoted as saying, ""We're spending much more time on story, being very meticulous about that""."
6615,tt0369226,7666,22,"Tara Reid called Alone in the Dark ""a smarter film""."
6616,tt0369226,7666,23,Let me not mislead anyone.
6617,tt0369226,7666,24,"A lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film, but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else."
6618,tt0369226,7666,25,"I usually had no idea what any setting's relation was to any other setting, why we were there, or what anyone was doing at least when each scene began."
6619,tt0369226,7666,26,"It's just a random mishmash of settings and clich√©s, as if director Uwe Boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers."
6620,tt0369226,7666,27,"Then when he was done, he and editor Richard Schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice, then reassembled it by throwing the I Ching."
6621,tt0369226,7666,28,"Sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel which is a combination of short, varied, unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work, but perhaps that's being too generous."
6622,tt0369226,7666,29,I'm not sure Boll would get work if this were his reel.
6623,tt0369226,7666,30,"Just as I tend to at least like most films, I tend to like most actors and most performances."
6624,tt0369226,7666,31,It's very rare that I say that a performance was bad.
6625,tt0369226,7666,32,"Well, Tara Reid was bad here and I'm someone who usually likes Reid."
6626,tt0369226,7666,33,I don't know what happened.
6627,tt0369226,7666,34,"For a large percentage of the film, they just move her around the set like a prop."
6628,tt0369226,7666,35,They might as well have just bought a blow up doll.
6629,tt0369226,7666,36,That would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings.
6630,tt0369226,7666,37,Maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that's usually reserved for entertaining mother in laws.
6631,tt0369226,7666,38,"And speaking of that dialogue, a lot of Alone in the Dark plays like a Godzilla film without Godzilla."
6632,tt0369226,7666,39,"By that, I mean that it's a lot of pseudo scientific gobbledy gook."
6633,tt0369226,7666,40,"At least in Godzilla films, there's a campiness to it, because they know how ridiculous it is, and there's a big payoff in that we get to see Godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something."
6634,tt0369226,7666,41,"Just what Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are doing here, besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents, is difficult to say."
6635,tt0369226,7666,42,"I can't say that I thought anyone in the film had a decent performance, although maybe Slater at least saw the cigar."
6636,tt0369226,7666,43,I think that's unprecedented for me.
6637,tt0369226,7666,44,"Still, I didn't give this film a 1."
6638,tt0369226,7666,45,"There was some competent cinematography, even if Boll and Schwadel made mincemeat out of it, and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good."
6639,tt0369226,7666,46,"Heck, even the novelette prologue wasn't so bad."
6640,tt0369226,7666,47,I actually thought the film had promise at that point.
6641,tt0369226,7666,48,But this may just be the worst film I've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more.
6642,tt0369226,7667,1,"The definition of an abomination as defined by Webster's Dictioary is ""a cause of abhorrence or disgust."""
6643,tt0369226,7667,2,"If someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for Alone in the Dark, please let me know because this is the best I can come up with."
6644,tt0369226,7667,3,"However, I do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is."
6645,tt0369226,7667,4,I went to see this film with two of my roommates.
6646,tt0369226,7667,5,"One has very similar tastes to me, the other is an action/adventure flick guru."
6647,tt0369226,7667,6,"This latter guy usually doesn't care about the size of the plot holes, as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied."
6648,tt0369226,7667,7,That being said we entered the theater for the Friday viewing of Alone in the Dark.
6649,tt0369226,7667,8,Little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater.
6650,tt0369226,7667,9,When it started I knew why immediately.
6651,tt0369226,7667,10,"It begins with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately I have to admit it only gets worse from there."
6652,tt0369226,7667,11,The opening scene is a 5 minute scroll text that is narrated.
6653,tt0369226,7667,12,"Yet, I understand why it was narrated."
6654,tt0369226,7667,13,The director must have understood that only illiterate people would even ascertain the thought of PAYING to see this movie.
6655,tt0369226,7667,14,"Yet, not only is this first scene the longest scroll text in the history of cinema, but it also makes no sense."
6656,tt0369226,7667,15,It seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies.
6657,tt0369226,7667,16,"One is about an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal, the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans."
6658,tt0369226,7667,17,"If you are reading this and are confused, you are not alone."
6659,tt0369226,7667,18,"Then the awful storyline, acting, effects, and camera work begin."
6660,tt0369226,7667,19,Tara Reid is horrendous as an actress.
6661,tt0369226,7667,20,She does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum curator.
6662,tt0369226,7667,21,"Slater is just bad, not convincing, and has no chemistry with Reid."
6663,tt0369226,7667,22,The plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man.
6664,tt0369226,7667,23,The entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like: What is this.
6665,tt0369226,7667,24,And what is going on.
6666,tt0369226,7667,25,Other than this scrolling garbage we have a few narrated sequences by Slater himself.
6667,tt0369226,7667,26,Are they good.
6668,tt0369226,7667,27,NO.
6669,tt0369226,7667,28,Do they explain anything.
6670,tt0369226,7667,29,NO.
6671,tt0369226,7667,30,Do we at any point as an audience have the slightest inkling as to why we should care what happens.
6672,tt0369226,7667,31,"Once again, NO.Then we have a random sex scene."
6673,tt0369226,7667,32,"We are told that Slater and Reid are together, yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another."
6674,tt0369226,7667,33,But then BAM...sex scene.
6675,tt0369226,7667,34,Once again I don't know.
6676,tt0369226,7667,35,"A good, oh i don't know, 30 seconds after that woeful scene ends we have a gunfight with 20 or so military and a similar number of alien things."
6677,tt0369226,7667,36,This is set to a heavy metal track and causes more brain hemorrhaging than one ever thought possible.
6678,tt0369226,7667,37,And if that wasn't enough...
6679,tt0369226,7667,38,There exists no main villain.
6680,tt0369226,7667,39,"There is the scientist and there are the ""alien"" things."
6681,tt0369226,7667,40,At one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost.
6682,tt0369226,7667,41,Why.
6683,tt0369226,7667,42,How did he become the supreme commander of these things.
6684,tt0369226,7667,43,Why do they listen to him.
6685,tt0369226,7667,44,Once again I have no idea.
6686,tt0369226,7667,45,The movie ends with Slater and Reid walking in an evacuated city.
6687,tt0369226,7667,46,Why was the city evacuated.
6688,tt0369226,7667,47,Did the alien things break through.
6689,tt0369226,7667,48,Did the military tell them.
6690,tt0369226,7667,49,Who knows...and by this point who cares.
6691,tt0369226,7667,50,I didn't and you won't.
6692,tt0369226,7667,51,"But to top it off, Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing."
6693,tt0369226,7667,52,Even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight.
6694,tt0369226,7667,53,"And thats right, you guessed it, it the middle of the &%$ing day and it's bright as can be."
6695,tt0369226,7667,54,"Maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses, I don't know and I don't care."
6696,tt0369226,7667,55,"Now after the movie ended I ran outside the theater, all 6 foot 6 inches of me, waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie."
6697,tt0369226,7667,56,Even my gung ho action/adventure roommate who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of explosion into 1 film to be the greatest thing ever created admitted that plot holes were very evident in this film.
6698,tt0369226,7667,57,To sum up this CRAP FEST i give it a 0.0/10 and would give it lower if I could.
6699,tt0369226,7667,58,"Unequivocally, the worst movie ever made."
6700,tt0369226,7667,59,I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.
6701,tt0369226,7668,1,"The minute the forward started, I knew we were in for trouble!"
6702,tt0369226,7668,2,The premise is laughable at best.
6703,tt0369226,7668,3,"The story line was even worse, if that is possible."
6704,tt0369226,7668,4,The acting was stiff and the actors gave off a sense of inexperience.
6705,tt0369226,7668,5,"You expect more from the likes of Slater, Reid and Dorff."
6706,tt0369226,7668,6,Lines were delivered as if from a robot.
6707,tt0369226,7668,7,"And I'm sorry, I like Reid but she was VERY unbelievable as an archaeologist."
6708,tt0369226,7668,8,Slater and Dorff picked a lousy film to try and stage their comebacks.
6709,tt0369226,7668,9,The continuity was off through out the entire film.
6710,tt0369226,7668,10,"The creatures weren't bad, but they really weren't good either."
6711,tt0369226,7668,11,"Bottom line, I want that ninety minutes of my life back."
6712,tt0369226,7668,12,"They can keep the money, but give me the time!"
6713,tt0369226,7668,13,What a waste.
6714,tt0369226,7669,1,This movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen.
6715,tt0369226,7669,2,However this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess.
6716,tt0369226,7669,3,It almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid.
6717,tt0369226,7669,4,"If you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film."
6718,tt0369226,7669,5,"I can't go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that Ed Wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece."
6719,tt0369226,7669,6,"To start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen/heard, this thing has got to be five minutes long."
6720,tt0369226,7669,7,"On top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read."
6721,tt0369226,7669,8,Then we meet Mr.
6722,tt0369226,7669,9,"Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line."
6723,tt0369226,7669,10,"Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does."
6724,tt0369226,7669,11,"Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us!"
6725,tt0369226,7669,12,"Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type."
6726,tt0369226,7669,13,"All in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video, I know that I got a kick out of it, I mean lets all be honest here, sometimes its comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others."
6727,tt0369226,7670,1,Well where do I begin my story..
6728,tt0369226,7670,2,"I went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the Actors that were in it, and that it was supposed to be a horror movie."
6729,tt0369226,7670,3,"Well I figured out within the first 20 minutes, what a poor decision I had made going out seeing this movie."
6730,tt0369226,7670,4,"The Plot was crap, and so was the script."
6731,tt0369226,7670,5,The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically.
6732,tt0369226,7670,6,The cast couldn't have been more plastic looking.
6733,tt0369226,7670,7,Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker...like they dragged on for no particular reason.
6734,tt0369226,7670,8,Very poor editing.
6735,tt0369226,7670,9,All in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money.
6736,tt0369226,7670,10,Boo.
6737,tt0369226,7671,1,The movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes.
6738,tt0369226,7671,2,It gives the basic summary of what is going on.
6739,tt0369226,7671,3,This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect.
6740,tt0369226,7671,4,"Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them."
6741,tt0369226,7671,5,The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie.
6742,tt0369226,7671,6,"Not only does the plot change, but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie."
6743,tt0369226,7671,7,"I have never played the video game, but know people who have."
6744,tt0369226,7671,8,From my understanding whether you've played the game or not this movie does not get any better.
6745,tt0369226,7671,9,Save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters.
6746,tt0369226,7672,1,"Obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie, so don't even look at the credits at the end, you'll only hold it against them."
6747,tt0369226,7672,2,"Nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed out after 10 minutes, and they were the lucky ones."
6748,tt0369226,7672,3,"The 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien."
6749,tt0369226,7672,4,"The creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters, so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began."
6750,tt0369226,7672,5,"Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is."
6751,tt0369226,7672,6,"If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and you don't pass out, you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film."
6752,tt0369226,7672,7,"The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing of the 'Queen Mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this."
6753,tt0369226,7672,8,"If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin at the video store."
6754,tt0369226,7672,9,"If there's any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you."
6755,tt0369226,7673,1,I don't know where to begin.
6756,tt0369226,7673,2,Tara Reid needs to be stopped before she's put in another movie.
6757,tt0369226,7673,3,"Stephen Dorff looks like he got his character's motivation from Val Kilmer in ""Top Gun""."
6758,tt0369226,7673,4,Slater sleepwalks through this dreck.
6759,tt0369226,7673,5,"The direction, editing, sound do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a gunfight., costumes bulletproof vests with muscles on them, and hey, there's no discernible plot either."
6760,tt0369226,7673,6,"It amazes me that no one attached to the project stopped and said, ""hey guys, this just doesn't make any sense, let's start over""."
6761,tt0369226,7673,7,Hopefully Slater's career can rebound from this disaster.
6762,tt0369226,7673,8,Hands down the worst film I've ever seen.
6763,tt0369226,7674,1,"True, there are many movies much worse then this movie."
6764,tt0369226,7674,2,"This movie was no Manos: The Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 yes, I have seen them both.. twice but at the same time this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs."
6765,tt0369226,7674,3,"Predator Yes, even that movie surpassed this."
6766,tt0369226,7674,4,Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars it is so bad.
6767,tt0369226,7674,5,"Razzie awards lookout, your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters."
6768,tt0369226,7674,6,This film I'm talking about is of course Alone in the Dark.
6769,tt0369226,7674,7,I'll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad.
6770,tt0369226,7674,8,"Acting I'll first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film next to the ending credits, which played 'Wish I had An Angel', the acting."
6771,tt0369226,7674,9,"Christian Slater must be proud of himself, he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze."
6772,tt0369226,7674,10,"Though all his awful dialog he had to speak, it made me wonder why he just didn't walk off the set halfway."
6773,tt0369226,7674,11,Perhaps it was because of Stephen Dorff being in the film as well somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it.
6774,tt0369226,7674,12,Tara Reid is a bad actress but good looking and that's all that really matters in films like these.
6775,tt0369226,7674,13,"That is not to say the acting was perfect though, it was average, not good, and perhaps the only thing in the film not good."
6776,tt0369226,7674,14,"The Soundtrack Except for 'Wish I had An Angel', the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears, perhaps to disguise the awful story something I will get to soon."
6777,tt0369226,7674,15,A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged.
6778,tt0369226,7674,16,The Directing Directed by Hollywoods favorite director Uwe Ball who brought us the classic House of the Dead.
6779,tt0369226,7674,17,"Telling us ""Yes, movies can get this utterly bad and that's just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies""."
6780,tt0369226,7674,18,At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball.
6781,tt0369226,7674,19,"Without being told I would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo, brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked."
6782,tt0369226,7674,20,The director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall.
6783,tt0369226,7674,21,"On the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action, the camera stops for some reason."
6784,tt0369226,7674,22,The Producing Who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb.
6785,tt0369226,7674,23,I pity the fool... sometimes.
6786,tt0369226,7674,24,Sometimes I'm glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag.
6787,tt0369226,7674,25,The Writing / Storyboard Trying to Analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I possibly could with it right after but I will still attempt it.
6788,tt0369226,7674,26,Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments.
6789,tt0369226,7674,27,He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud.
6790,tt0369226,7674,28,Then it fast forwards many years later where he's a paranoia detective.
6791,tt0369226,7674,29,"He get's attacked by some zombie that can't be shot to death, kills it and moves on with life."
6792,tt0369226,7674,30,Later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows.
6793,tt0369226,7674,31,"Yeah, the plot is bad, really really bad."
6794,tt0369226,7674,32,"The film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes, which felt like 100, of random text about an untrue civilization called the Abskani."
6795,tt0369226,7674,33,"The film goes not to have one twist after another, more then the audience can handle, more then the audience wants to handle, more then the audience could ever care about."
6796,tt0369226,7674,34,This storyline is rock bottom bad that even Double Dragon does better.
6797,tt0369226,7674,35,"Overall, miss out on this movie."
6798,tt0369226,7674,36,I gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0.
6799,tt0369226,7675,1,Can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever.
6800,tt0369226,7675,2,"Answer: Yes, and this is one of them."
6801,tt0369226,7675,3,After helming the appalling 'House of the Dead' director Uwe Boll has now cast his less than talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation.
6802,tt0369226,7675,4,Don't these guys get it.
6803,tt0369226,7675,5,"To anyone who can't understand, here it is in block capitals for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES!"
6804,tt0369226,7675,6,"The acting here is, at best, sub standard."
6805,tt0369226,7675,7,The set design and special effects are poor.
6806,tt0369226,7675,8,"Unlike the video game which did have its scary moments the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or menace."
6807,tt0369226,7675,9,Pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper.
6808,tt0369226,7675,10,The main culprit is the director.
6809,tt0369226,7675,11,Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush.
6810,tt0369226,7675,12,"Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored."
6811,tt0369226,7675,13,Why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets.
6812,tt0369226,7675,14,Avoid at all costs.
6813,tt0369226,7676,1,I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark.
6814,tt0369226,7676,2,"It was so bad, I could hardly believe what I was seeing."
6815,tt0369226,7676,3,"There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed."
6816,tt0369226,7676,4,"The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it."
6817,tt0369226,7676,5,"There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation."
6818,tt0369226,7676,6,"In fact, many action scenes just began on their own, coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track."
6819,tt0369226,7676,7,"While I was watching this movie I kept asking ""Where is this happening."
6820,tt0369226,7676,8,"What's going on."""
6821,tt0369226,7676,9,"The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines."
6822,tt0369226,7676,10,Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design.
6823,tt0369226,7676,11,ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room.
6824,tt0369226,7676,12,"The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements."
6825,tt0369226,7676,13,"So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes."
6826,tt0369226,7676,14,"They were here, now they're there."
6827,tt0369226,7676,15,"This was happening, now that's happening."
6828,tt0369226,7676,16,Random scenes with little rhyme or reason.
6829,tt0369226,7676,17,I had a lot of fun watching it.
6830,tt0369226,7676,18,Definitely not worth nine bucks though.
6831,tt0473310,6606,1,"Please Don't hate me but i have to be honest, watching this movie, i had a lot of fun,,It's a Movie with a Stupid Cast and Stupid Songs!!!"
6832,tt0473310,6606,2,Unnecessary songs!!!

6838,tt0473310,6606,8,Sounded like a Playboy Song Stupid Song...
6839,tt0473310,6606,9,Other than Songs.
6840,tt0473310,6606,10,The Movie was OK This was Ram Gopal Verma's Own Adaptation...
6841,tt0473310,6606,11,If you think like that you will like this movieWell this movie only Depends on the Viewer and on his judgement whether he/she thinks this movie is total Copy He/She would want to hit her Head on the Cinema Seat OR if he/She Thinks of the Directors Own Look he/she would be relaxed and take a look at this movieAnyways I looked at both ways i would Congratulate and Abuse Ram Gopal for this Disaster that he made...
6842,tt0473310,6606,12,Well Some other Things that bothered that The CAST was Incredibly BadAmitabh Bachchan As Babban/Gabbar Amitabh in his own Movie Remake Funny what was the Director Thinking Ajay Devgan As Heero/VeeruBobby Deol Could have been Better Prashant Raj As Raj/JaiAbhishek was Meant for this role Despite doing a Special Appearance in the Mehbooba song Sushmita Sen As Radha/DurgaJaya Bachchan was Right Tabu was Right for this Role Nisha Kothari As Ghungroo/BasantiI think Esha Deol would have been Great Mohanlal As Narishma/ThakurMohanlal Is So Cute....
6843,tt0473310,6606,13,"Oops Sorry hehehehe, He Was OK I could not Think of anyoneThe Movie would have Even FAIRED a LIttle if the Cast was OKI movie wasn't even exciting, the movie was just OK , Just for watchingThe Overall RatingDirection..."

6847,tt0473310,6606,17,"5/10 Unnecessary in the Movie, could have been better, Easy on the Ears on to be played in PC's and IPod's and Stuff Cast..."
6848,tt0473310,6606,18,1/10Total ...
6849,tt0473310,6606,19,3/10Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
6850,tt0473310,6607,1,"Not as bad as some are making it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared to the original."
6851,tt0473310,6607,2,In my opinion Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh try not to compare to Gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect.
6852,tt0473310,6607,3,"Other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest of the film is flawed."
6853,tt0473310,6607,4,"Character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the DVD case."
6854,tt0473310,6607,5,The worst part of the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj.
6855,tt0473310,6607,6,Nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open.
6856,tt0473310,6607,7,As for Prashant Raj seriously who is this guy. where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks..
6857,tt0473310,6607,8,"His acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died."
6858,tt0473310,6607,9,"Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion. overall, RGV's Aag is worth watching for Amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance."
6859,tt0473310,6608,1,its a gem movie if anyone who hasn't seen movie sholey he cant understand what is going on there. a thakur call men for catching a big terrorist who is like god and even police don't know abut him but these ppl do.biggest advantage of film is its speed u never know what is going on and the part is completed. actors are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time pass of songs. and what u cant forget is the cool dialouge which seems to come in very long time but u cant understand them so easily try hard for that and last word i haven't seen movie complete due to a brain roast so plz tell me ditz end if it have
6860,tt0473310,6609,1,"I cannot say that Aag is the worst Bollywood film ever made, because I haven't seen every Bollywood film, but my imagination tells me that it could well be."
6861,tt0473310,6609,2,"This film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director, and I for one be believe he has been successful in his mission."
6862,tt0473310,6609,3,No A list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with it.
6863,tt0473310,6609,4,"But lets not just blame the director here, there is the cinematographer, who looks like he's rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award."
6864,tt0473310,6609,5,"There is the over dramatic score, that hopes to carry you to the next scene."
6865,tt0473310,6609,6,"The lighting man, who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other, and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene."
6866,tt0473310,6609,7,"And, of course the actors!"
6867,tt0473310,6609,8,"Some of them are by no means newcomers, else all could be forgiven here."
6868,tt0473310,6609,9,"The ensemble of actors in Aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re make of India's most loved movie of all time, 'Sholay'."
6869,tt0473310,6609,10,"One must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film, they are A list and willing participants to something that, let's face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation..."
6870,tt0473310,6609,11,"So it begs the question, Amitabh aside for now, did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original."
6871,tt0473310,6609,12,Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film.
6872,tt0473310,6609,13,"Don't be stupid, of course he didn't, this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walk."
6873,tt0473310,6609,14,"I truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film, which only succeeds in polluting everyone's mind when they watch the original."
6874,tt0473310,6610,1,This movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop.
6875,tt0473310,6610,2,"Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie ""Sholay"", but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and... i guess leave all the good parts of the movie acting, script, songs, music, comedy, action etc out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew."
6876,tt0473310,6610,3,"Waste of money, waste of time."
6877,tt0473310,6610,4,"After making movies like Rangeela, Satya, and Company he pulled a Coppola Godfather on us; What were you thinking RGV."
6878,tt0473310,6610,5,"Anyways, the story is, though hard to follow, is almost like the Old sholay."
6879,tt0473310,6610,6,"Ajay Devgan playing Heero Beeru, sholay and Ajay, new kid on the block playing Ajay Jay,sholay."
6880,tt0473310,6610,7,"Both ""bad yet funny"" friends help a cop capture a bad guy first."
6881,tt0473310,6610,8,"Later in the movie, now Retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan."
6882,tt0473310,6610,9,"In case you haven't been watching Bollywood movies, the Good guys win in the end."
6883,tt0473310,6610,10,There I just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!
6884,tt0473310,6611,1,"In a variant of Sholay , Ram Gopal Verma ventures into what can be called an unknown territory where the blockbuster takes a new shape."
6885,tt0473310,6611,2,The Thakur goes south.
6886,tt0473310,6611,3,Mohanlal as Narsimha the police inspector whose family has been killed seeks vengeance Madrasi style.
6887,tt0473310,6611,4,The accent is totally South Indian in contrast to Thakur from the north.
6888,tt0473310,6611,5,The severing of the hands of Thakur by Gabbar is also cut down to the fingers in Aag.
6889,tt0473310,6611,6,So make up costs are cut down because there is no effort to hide the hands instead only a long shouldered Kurta covers up for the cut fingers.
6890,tt0473310,6611,7,"Moreso in the climax where the Thakur uses his legs and says""Tere Liye to mere paer hi kaafi hai"" here Narsimha uses his finger stubs to fire a gun and kill the villain."
6891,tt0473310,6611,8,"Babban, the new avtar of gabbar is also different."
6892,tt0473310,6611,9,He is not from Bihar or UP.
6893,tt0473310,6611,10,He is Bambaiya.
6894,tt0473310,6611,11,Gabbar's infamous laugh is also in two instalments this time and is more subdued.
6895,tt0473310,6611,12,Babban asks for Diwali instead of Holi and romances Urmila the replacement of Helen in Mehbooba. he also dances and enjoys dancing with Abhisheh who plays Jalal Agha in Mehbooba.
6896,tt0473310,6611,13,Babban is more intelligent this time.
6897,tt0473310,6611,14,He tosses the apple and asks the question that made Isaac Newton discover laws of gravitation.
6898,tt0473310,6611,15,Basanti is more verbose than the Auto driver Ghungroo.
6899,tt0473310,6611,16,Nisha Kothari cannot play the auto driver and looks too artificial using words like 'entertain' and 'too much' with gay abandon.
6900,tt0473310,6611,17,Viru was fun whereas Ajay Devgun is a misfit for the role.
6901,tt0473310,6611,18,The God Speaks to Basanti incident and the shooting lessons and the Koi Haseena song and the water tank sequences are painful.
6902,tt0473310,6611,19,The water tank turns into a well and the drunk Devgun is so bad in the sequence that the audience would have wanted him to commit suicide.
6903,tt0473310,6611,20,Jai was composed and serious.
6904,tt0473310,6611,21,Prashant Raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him.
6905,tt0473310,6611,22,But he also bungles on the Mausi sequence.
6906,tt0473310,6611,23,He is not as romantic as Jai with the mouth organ .
6907,tt0473310,6611,24,Jaya's role played by Sushmita changes careers.
6908,tt0473310,6611,25,A pure housewife turns into a doctor this time plunging into full time social service after her husband is killed.
6909,tt0473310,6611,26,She too lacks the pain that Jaya displayed.
6910,tt0473310,6611,27,Her flirtations with Jai are more open this time.
6911,tt0473310,6611,28,Samba gets a bigger role this time as Tambe.
6912,tt0473310,6611,29,He does not have to point guns and answer questions of Gabbar this time.
6913,tt0473310,6611,30,He follows Babban wherever he goes and is a bodyguard with more visibility outside the den.
6914,tt0473310,6611,31,Horses give way to Jeeps and auto.
6915,tt0473310,6611,32,The Gabbar's hideout here keeps changing and Ramgarh becomes Kaliganj.
6916,tt0473310,6611,33,All in all it is more of a spoof than anything else.
6917,tt0473310,6611,34,RGV comes up with his own interpretation of the classic.
6918,tt0473310,6611,35,But we remember the original so well even after three decades that our minds refuse to accept stylized versions and changed dialogues.
6919,tt0473310,6611,36,So we call it a spoof.
6920,tt0473310,6611,37,So Mr.
6921,tt0473310,6611,38,RGVSholay and Farhan Akhtar Don and JPDuttaUmrao jaan stop making remixes and start making originals.
6922,tt0473310,6612,1,I downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site the Quality was kinda good!
6923,tt0473310,6612,2,"I was watching the movie with high expectations though i knew it was a flop, especially as the film has superstar Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a villain."
6924,tt0473310,6612,3,I though at least actors like him would have done some worth to their roles.
6925,tt0473310,6612,4,But unfortunately Mr Bachchan failed to impress as villain this proved that nobody can compete AMJAD KHAN's magic Rgv's trial to re kindle the past backfired royally!
6926,tt0473310,6612,5,"Sholay, the old one is a milestone in Indian cinema with an all star cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too."
6927,tt0473310,6612,6,A good actor like Ajay Devgan's TALENTS ARE wasted and his performance was average.
6928,tt0473310,6612,7,"Prashant Raj, a newcomer doesn't know what acting is ."
6929,tt0473310,6612,8,Nisha Kothari proved she is one of the worst actresses we have I don't know how she is still in RGV's crew Urmila & Abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion Mohanlal tried his best and Susmitha Sen's work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie It was a Total carnage of the original Sholay
6930,tt0473310,6613,1,Iam a Big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma but i could not believe that he made this movie. i was really disappointed.
6931,tt0473310,6613,2,Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag doesn't come anywhere close to the real Sholay.
6932,tt0473310,6613,3,It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer.
6933,tt0473310,6613,4,Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between the characters .
6934,tt0473310,6613,5,There is no camaraderie between HeeroAjay Devgan and RajPrashant raj.
6935,tt0473310,6613,6,There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together.
6936,tt0473310,6613,7,The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable.
6937,tt0473310,6613,8,Amitabh Bachchan should not have done this movie.
6938,tt0473310,6613,9,Ajay and Sushmita sen was trying their best but no use.
6939,tt0473310,6613,10,Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation ineffective and rather pointless.
6940,tt0473310,6613,11,Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language.
6941,tt0473310,6613,12,Rest of the cast was below expectation.
6942,tt0473310,6613,13,The comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie.
6943,tt0473310,6613,14,Ram Gopal Varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this Aag.
6944,tt0473310,6613,15,But there is no fire.
6945,tt0473310,6614,1,Sholay: Considered to be one of the greatest films.
6946,tt0473310,6614,2,I always wondered if they would ever remake being the classic it is.
6947,tt0473310,6614,3,That was the time RGV announced this movie and I was somewhat excited to see it.
6948,tt0473310,6614,4,"I always thought that maybe this will be a good movie, but every week we would here RGV change something."
6949,tt0473310,6614,5,"And the movie is a very B Grade movie, something that I had not hoped."
6950,tt0473310,6614,6,"I really tried looking for positives, but I promised to keep Sholay out of my mind."
6951,tt0473310,6614,7,The cinematography is awesome.
6952,tt0473310,6614,8,The movie tries to be its own.
6953,tt0473310,6614,9,But that is the up side.
6954,tt0473310,6614,10,The action sequences are weak.
6955,tt0473310,6614,11,The screenplay had potential.
6956,tt0473310,6614,12,The biggest flaw is editing.
6957,tt0473310,6614,13,None of the scenes excite you.
6958,tt0473310,6614,14,"For example, the comedy sequences felt very out of place and forced."
6959,tt0473310,6614,15,Ironic because comedy was just as entertaining in the original.
6960,tt0473310,6614,16,And none of the characters are developed.
6961,tt0473310,6614,17,And no scenes will linger until the end.
6962,tt0473310,6614,18,And the ending was very disappointing.
6963,tt0473310,6614,19,The biggest question is acting.
6964,tt0473310,6614,20,"Amitabh Bachchan was good as Gabbar Singh, nothing great."
6965,tt0473310,6614,21,"It seemed as if they concentrated too much on his look, that the character only looks menacing, but you don't get creeped out."
6966,tt0473310,6614,22,"Mohanlal is barely in the movie, but he impresses in his few scenes."
6967,tt0473310,6614,23,Ajay Devgan was decent.
6968,tt0473310,6614,24,"It wasn't so much the performance, he gave it his all, it was the weak script."
6969,tt0473310,6614,25,"Prashant Raj is very confident, and has potential to make it far with better movies."
6970,tt0473310,6614,26,"I had most expectations for Sushmita Sen, who was probably the best of the lot."
6971,tt0473310,6614,27,"She was expressive, but this still was not enough."
6972,tt0473310,6614,28,Nisha Kothari surprised me.
6973,tt0473310,6614,29,"She seemed disinterested for the most part, but her emotional scene after her friend's death was quite good."
6974,tt0473310,6614,30,"Seems as if she needs to find a director who will help her talent, not her cute looks."
6975,tt0473310,6614,31,But what disappointed me most was chemistry.
6976,tt0473310,6614,32,Ajay Devgan and Prashant Raj didn't look like friends.
6977,tt0473310,6614,33,Ajay Nisha were not a strong couple.
6978,tt0473310,6614,34,No passion was to be found between Sushmita and Prashant.
6979,tt0473310,6614,35,And Amitabh and Mohanlal did not the hateful passion they needed.
6980,tt0473310,6614,36,"As for songs, they pretty much suck."
6981,tt0473310,6614,37,Urmila's Mehbooba was too overblown and I pretty much slept through it.
6982,tt0473310,6614,38,It was however nicely danced.
6983,tt0473310,6614,39,"The Holi number was enjoyable, but not memorable."
6984,tt0473310,6614,40,Same went for the other songs.
6985,tt0473310,6614,41,"For someone who looked forward to this movie, I was heavily disappointed."
6986,tt0473310,6614,42,"I had high hopes for RGV because of his Jungle, but seems as if he lost his talent during the shooting of this movie."
6987,tt0473310,6614,43,But hopefully he regains his talent for Sarkar Raj.
6988,tt0473310,6614,44,But this movie is best forgotten.
6989,tt0473310,6614,45,All the positives still do not make up for the boring movie it is.
6990,tt0473310,6615,1,Once in a while in Indian cinema there comes along a movie like Sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie.
6991,tt0473310,6615,2,And den just once in a whilehopefully we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own.
6992,tt0473310,6615,3,"A standard so low, it can never be broken."
6993,tt0473310,6615,4,Ram Gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance.
6994,tt0473310,6615,5,To take a classic like Sholay and assassinate it is totally unforgivable and I can't believe he almost called the movie RGV ki Sholay.
6995,tt0473310,6615,6,"Although Sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it, the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever."
6996,tt0473310,6615,7,What Aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly u'll need a contest to pick the worst.
6997,tt0473310,6615,8,"The realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of ""actors"" parading along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events."
6998,tt0473310,6615,9,"One star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote. its time for RGV to wake up to the reality of his failure and conjure up another ""different"" plot that can be categorized under cinema."
6999,tt0473310,6616,1,"I must tell you right up front, I am certainly NOT an authority on Bollywood films and have only seen a handful."
7000,tt0473310,6616,2,"However, if you've never seen one, DON'T start with this one!"
7001,tt0473310,6616,3,"I have greatly enjoyed the ones I've seen up until this one, but I just couldn't stand this one."
7002,tt0473310,6616,4,I also must tell you up front that I could not finish this film it was that annoying.
7003,tt0473310,6616,5,So why was it so annoying.
7004,tt0473310,6616,6,1
7005,tt0473310,6616,7,There is a character named 'Rambha' in the film.
7006,tt0473310,6616,8,He is even more annoying than Jar Jar Binks which I never would have believed would have been possible.
7007,tt0473310,6616,9,He is so #@^!
7008,tt0473310,6616,10,# annoying!!
7009,tt0473310,6616,11,He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think was meant to be comic relief.
7010,tt0473310,6616,12,"Instead, he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to die...slowly!"
7011,tt0473310,6616,13,"His voice, his mannerisms and his obnoxiousness he just didn't seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in and he needed to die!"
7012,tt0473310,6616,14,2
7013,tt0473310,6616,15,The heroes had the amazing ability to dodge AK 47 bullets with ease.
7014,tt0473310,6616,16,I kid you not there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles!!
7015,tt0473310,6616,17,"And, again and again, they avoided taking a single bullet AND beat up the ruffians!!!"
7016,tt0473310,6616,18,"This made Stallone's actions in ""Rambo II"" look mundane!!"
7017,tt0473310,6616,19,3
7018,tt0473310,6616,20,"The film was so gosh darn loud, in your face and intense it practically made my brain bleed!!"
7019,tt0473310,6616,21,It was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth!!
7020,tt0473310,6616,22,"Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and action, action, action...this movie is clearly designed for someone who can't take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100% action.4."
7021,tt0473310,6616,23,The two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense...none whatsoever!
7022,tt0473310,6616,24,"Perhaps if you are the most ardent action and Bollywood fan you can stand this film, but as for me I can see why it's on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list."
7023,tt0473310,6616,25,Wow...this film is bad AND intensely bad!!
7024,tt0473310,6617,1,Truly shows that hype is not everything.
7025,tt0473310,6617,2,Shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife.
7026,tt0473310,6617,3,Amitabh as always is solid.
7027,tt0473310,6617,4,Ajay Devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke.
7028,tt0473310,6617,5,The leading lady is such a waste of an actor.
7029,tt0473310,6617,6,Such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry.
7030,tt0473310,6617,7,With movies as such I have decreased the amount of bollywood movies I watch.
7031,tt0473310,6617,8,RGV has been making very crappy movies for a while now.
7032,tt0473310,6617,9,Time to get different actors.
7033,tt0473310,6617,10,Hrithek anyone.
7034,tt0473310,6617,11,Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back.
7035,tt0473310,6617,12,Every other leading lady is a half naked wanna be.
7036,tt0473310,6617,13,Pffffft.
7037,tt0473310,6618,1,OVERALL PERFORMANCE : At last the long waiting AAG hits the screens.
7038,tt0473310,6618,2,"Unfortunately, it couldn't set progressive fire in the audience."
7039,tt0473310,6618,3,The first best thing to talk about the movie is The idea of remaking the mighty SHOLAY.
7040,tt0473310,6618,4,And Varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie.
7041,tt0473310,6618,5,"If he repeated the same Ramghad backdrop, people will again say there is nothing new in this."
7042,tt0473310,6618,6,Different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy.
7043,tt0473310,6618,7,"Right from the start of his career with SIVA in Telugu, he had been using the same lighting and kind of background."
7044,tt0473310,6618,8,I seriously dunno this guy Varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis GODFATHER.
7045,tt0473310,6618,9,It's all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH.
7046,tt0473310,6618,10,Why would some body use so many Dutch angles and extreme closeup shots!!!!!!!
7047,tt0473310,6618,11,The shot division is lame.
7048,tt0473310,6618,12,"Characters couldn't carry an emotion, performances are not to their mark, Storytelling is worse, Background is really really terrible."
7049,tt0473310,6618,13,Babban: Amitabhz been over prioritized to his job.
7050,tt0473310,6618,14,"VARMA produced great villains like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of Hindi Cinema."
7051,tt0473310,6618,15,There's no comparison of Gabbar with Babban.
7052,tt0473310,6618,16,"Babban is a more psycho rather than a villain, still he has a soft corner for his brother It's a gift in this movie."
7053,tt0473310,6618,17,Amitabhz performance is not to his mark.
7054,tt0473310,6618,18,His appearance itself is pathetic.
7055,tt0473310,6618,19,"The scar on his nose, symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema."
7056,tt0473310,6618,20,What ever they worked on Babban is not successful.
7057,tt0473310,6618,21,Babban is no comparison with Gabbar.
7058,tt0473310,6618,22,Narsimha: The first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands.
7059,tt0473310,6618,23,"If varma did that , it would be like teaching ABCD to a Bachelor degree holder."
7060,tt0473310,6618,24,Itz good he opened the secret early.
7061,tt0473310,6618,25,But the flashback is pathetic.
7062,tt0473310,6618,26,Varma couldn't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark.
7063,tt0473310,6618,27,Durga: The only character with betterment.
7064,tt0473310,6618,28,This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story.
7065,tt0473310,6618,29,"Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo: No body bothers or at least considers these character."
7066,tt0473310,6618,30,The utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz.
7067,tt0473310,6618,31,These characters carry nothing to this movie.
7068,tt0473310,6618,32,"RAMGOPALVARMA: His quality is degrading, diminishing."
7069,tt0473310,6618,33,AAG totally can be treated as a C grade movie.
7070,tt0473310,6618,34,"Sholay is a fire of revenge, problem of a town, meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by Dharmendra."
7071,tt0473310,6618,35,AAG never carried an emotion with its characters.
7072,tt0473310,6618,36,Storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters.
7073,tt0473310,6618,37,"Don't compare AAG with sholay, still u will not like it."
7074,tt0473310,6618,38,If you dare watch this movie.
7075,tt0473310,6618,39,You will be burnt alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
7076,tt0473310,6619,1,This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in the cinema!!
7077,tt0473310,6619,2,Could not wait for it to end.
7078,tt0473310,6619,3,"To make matters worse it is given a 12A certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot, just bodies slumping to the ground, even Babban getting killed was cut out!!!"
7079,tt0473310,6619,4,Too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as I think the makers knew it would flop disastrously!!
7080,tt0473310,6619,5,Amitabhs acting was great but that 'Basanti' wannabe and the other idiot who plays Devgans mate can't even act.
7081,tt0473310,6619,6,Devgan was wasted!!
7082,tt0473310,6619,7,I would not watch this for free again and I advise all others who read this to do just the same YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!
7083,tt0473310,6620,1,"I can't come up with appropriate enough words to describe the horror I felt sitting in that cinema watching Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag, the director's half hearted attempt to pay tribute to that classic Bollywood western, Sholay."
7084,tt0473310,6620,2,The biggest problem with Varma's remake is that he doesn't even try to make a credible film.
7085,tt0473310,6620,3,It's evident in every single frame of this movie that Varma's heart is just not in it.
7086,tt0473310,6620,4,"What you see on screen is a bad joke at best, a gimmick on the part of the filmmaker, and it pains you to see what little regard he actually shows for a film he claims he's been a fan of all his life."
7087,tt0473310,6620,5,"I've seen several bad films over the years, but I can't remember one that's been as much of a torture to sit through as this one."
7088,tt0473310,6620,6,"Consider yourself very brave if you're able to survive the entire film, because it tests your patience like few films have before."
7089,tt0473310,6620,7,"Varma may borrow his plot and characters from the original film, but his version is trite and hollow and doesn't have any of the spirit and energy of Sholay."
7090,tt0473310,6620,8,"Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag is actually a mockery of that timeless gem because it turns out to be everything that the original film was not way over the top, too long too boring, and entirely mindless."
7091,tt0473310,6620,9,Much loved moments from Sholay are parodied by Varma and for that you want to wring his neck.
7092,tt0473310,6620,10,"One of the most memorable scenes in Sholay in which Dharmendra as Veeru climbs up the watertank and threatens to jump down to his death is turned around in this film with Ajay Devgan playing Hero, pulling a pistol to his head threatening to shoot himself."
7093,tt0473310,6620,11,How you wish he'd pulled the trigger and spared us all the agony.
7094,tt0473310,6620,12,"Not only does Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag fail as a remake of Sholay, it's a pretty bad effort even as a stand alone film."
7095,tt0473310,6620,13,"The eardrum damaging background score sounds more like someone clanging vessels in the kitchen, and the camera work alternates between dramatic and head spinning."
7096,tt0473310,6620,14,Partners in this terrible crime of bringing this ridiculous film to screen are the film's mostly dead as wood actors.
7097,tt0473310,6620,15,"Sushmita Sen as Devi the widow takes both her role and the film too seriously, punctuating her lines with pauses, staring into camera for effect, and generally performing like her life depends upon it."
7098,tt0473310,6620,16,"Mohanlal as Narsimha, struggles with his Hindi dialogue and looks embarrassed to be delivering some of the stupidest lines in his illustrious career."
7099,tt0473310,6620,17,Newcomer Prashant Raj playing Jai equivalent Raj has no acting chops to speak of and can't strum up any of the brooding intensity Amitabh Bachchan brought to the part in the original film.
7100,tt0473310,6620,18,"As Hero, the new age Veeru, Ajay Devgan is entirely hopeless, failing miserably in his attempts at comedy."
7101,tt0473310,6620,19,"But the film's weakest link, easily the most shocking casting decision is Nisha Kothari as Ghunghroo, who steps into the shoes of Hema Malini as Basanti, the endearing airhead from Sholay."
7102,tt0473310,6620,20,"Nisha Kothari is not only the worst actress in this country, but possibly the worst actress in this whole wide world, she gives the word annoying a whole new meaning, and she makes you want to slit your wrists every time she's on screen."
7103,tt0473310,6620,21,"And then, there is Amitabh Bachchan playing Babban Singh, Ramgopal Varma's version of Hindi cinema's most popular villain Gabbar Singh."
7104,tt0473310,6620,22,"The only actor in this ensemble who recognises the film's over the top tone and plays along accordingly, Bachchan constructs a menacing character who is a treat to watch."
7105,tt0473310,6620,23,"He's meant to be a comic book villain who snarls and sneers and hisses and hams, and he does all of that to good effect."
7106,tt0473310,6620,24,"But because he's trapped in such a doomed enterprise, his performance doesn't really help elevate the film in any way."
7107,tt0473310,6620,25,"No surprises here, I'm going with zero out of ten and two thumbs down for Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag, it one's of those painful movie watching experiences you wouldn't subject even an enemy to."
7108,tt0473310,6620,26,It's not like Varma hasn't handled a remake before.
7109,tt0473310,6620,27,"With Sarkar he gave us a smart, gripping take on The Godfather, and it's a pity he's made this Sholay bhature out of such a much loved classic."
7110,tt0473310,6620,28,"Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag is his worst career decision ever, it's also a dark spot on his resume he'll be embarrassed of forever."
7111,tt0473310,6620,29,I suspect this film will go down in movie history as Ramgopal Varma Ka Daag.
7112,tt0473310,6621,1,Something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot.
7113,tt0473310,6621,2,"The movie, that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema, fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making."
7114,tt0473310,6621,3,"The best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning, that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistake."
7115,tt0473310,6621,4,The editing is poor.
7116,tt0473310,6621,5,Direction is crap.
7117,tt0473310,6621,6,Acting is out of this worldomg!
7118,tt0473310,6621,7,The characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes.
7119,tt0473310,6621,8,I wouldn't watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it.
7120,tt0473310,6622,1,"I, like many other Bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay."
7121,tt0473310,6622,2,This movie was not it.
7122,tt0473310,6622,3,"Thank god they didn't let them use the name ""Sholay"" in the movie title."
7123,tt0473310,6622,4,Ram Gopal's remake is not worthy of the title.
7124,tt0473310,6622,5,"The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out of place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie I have ever seen."
7125,tt0473310,6622,6,You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast.
7126,tt0473310,6622,7,"The only non paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie."
7127,tt0473310,6622,8,"Abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding to Ash."
7128,tt0473310,6622,9,"Save your money, your mind and your time, don't bother with this movie or the DVD when that comes out."
7129,tt0473310,6623,1,First of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie nothing less than this available.
7130,tt0473310,6623,2,"The film fails in every department be it screenplay, direction, characterization or acting."
7131,tt0473310,6623,3,"1 To start with, the name of the movie is really C class though the movie itself match up to the name."
7132,tt0473310,6623,4,2 Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character.
7133,tt0473310,6623,5,"3 In Sholay Gabbar Singh has reward of 50,000 on him which was convincing."
7134,tt0473310,6623,6,Here in Aag the figure was 100 crores for Babban Amitabh Bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero's and had only few men bikes to commute with all automatic guns.
7135,tt0473310,6623,7,Making a Sholay like movie in Mumbai type setup in modern time doesn't look convincing.
7136,tt0473310,6623,8,"4 As for Nisha Kothari, somebody needs to tell her that she doesn't know acting."
7137,tt0473310,6623,9,Why is Ram Gopal Verma casting her again and again .
7138,tt0473310,6623,10,5 Mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do.
7139,tt0473310,6623,11,6 Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie.
7140,tt0473310,6623,12,7 Legendry role played by Lila Misra Mausi of Basanti in Sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some Gangu Mummy.
7141,tt0473310,6623,13,Ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie.
7142,tt0473310,6623,14,Enough of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag.
7143,tt0473310,6623,15,8 Should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru..pathetic to the greatest extent.
7144,tt0473310,6623,16,"To summarize, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic."
7145,tt0473310,6623,17,Please don't waste money and time on this movie.
7146,tt0473310,6623,18,"I think watching Aap Ka Surror which I thought was the worst movie possible would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and miserable direction."
7147,tt0473310,6623,19,"Thanks, Saurabh"
7148,tt0473310,6624,1,This film was absolutely...ugh i can't find the word oh wait... crap!
7149,tt0473310,6624,2,I mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring.
7150,tt0473310,6624,3,I nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth.
7151,tt0473310,6624,4,Ram Gopal Varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original Sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake.
7152,tt0473310,6624,5,What was he trying to do.
7153,tt0473310,6624,6,Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for Black.
7154,tt0473310,6624,7,Ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at.
7155,tt0473310,6624,8,What was Amitabh doing.
7156,tt0473310,6624,9,He's destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films.
7157,tt0473310,6624,10,First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from Bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and I'm telling you he's already past half his way.
7158,tt0473310,6624,11,I mean all this is really good for the other actors like Shah Rukh Khan who's getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of Amitabh.
7159,tt0473310,6624,12,I never really liked him because he thinks he's God and i just knew Abhishek was going to be in that movie.
7160,tt0473310,6624,13,If you want to save your ¬£17.75 and spend it on something good go watch Heyy Babyy because that's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one in the charts!
7161,tt0473310,6625,1,this is the first time I'm writing a comment on a movie on IMDb. but i had to write it for this one. its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture. from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gonna be bad. the acting is pathetic.
7162,tt0473310,6625,2,"I'm a big fan of Ajay devgan loved him in bhagat singh but he is at his worst in this movie. amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one, but somehow the fear is missing. prashant raj is a non actor. and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari. i have no clue why the director took her in this movie. the background score is repetitive. somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar, the color theme, the background score, the camera angles, but it didn't work."
7163,tt0473310,6625,3,PLEASE Don't WATCH IT
7164,tt0473310,6626,1,"i saw the film and i got screwed, because the film was foolish and boring. i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled ""sholay"". the cast and crew was bad. the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle. amithab bachan's acting is poor, i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year,sure. nobody did justice to their work, including Ajay devagan. this film don't deserve any audiences. i bet that this film will flop."
7165,tt0473310,6626,2,"""FINALLY THIS MOVIE SUCKS"""
7166,tt0473310,6627,1,What's happening to RGV.
7167,tt0473310,6627,2,He seems to repeat himself in every movie.
7168,tt0473310,6627,3,Has he run out of creative ideas.
7169,tt0473310,6627,4,"If he has, time to take a back seat."
7170,tt0473310,6627,5,Went to see the movie with great anticipation of course not once did I imagine it would be anywhere near the original.
7171,tt0473310,6627,6,"I knew it wouldn't, the promos said it all."
7172,tt0473310,6627,7,"But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treat, after all isn't he the same guy who directed Sathya and Company."
7173,tt0473310,6627,8,Or is he.
7174,tt0473310,6627,9,I have my doubts after watching Aag.
7175,tt0473310,6627,10,"I am not going to talk about the plot or the story, as most of it is taken from the original, if you are really dying to go and see this one, you could play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own!"
7176,tt0473310,6627,11,"So Veeru becomes Heero how corny is that., guess Heeru wouldn't sound that great."
7177,tt0473310,6627,12,"Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero, the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in Company sounds fake."
7178,tt0473310,6627,13,The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo Nisha Kothari doesn't exists at all.
7179,tt0473310,6627,14,In fact the more charming Nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes.
7180,tt0473310,6627,15,This reaches a peak by the end.
7181,tt0473310,6627,16,"Raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others, he is a guy to watch in the future."
7182,tt0473310,6627,17,"I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh."
7183,tt0473310,6627,18,"There is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl, instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl."
7184,tt0473310,6627,19,The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha.
7185,tt0473310,6627,20,I am afraid I don't have the patience to write more.
7186,tt0473310,6628,1,If the scale went negative I would be happier.
7187,tt0473310,6628,2,"Seeing Sushmita Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story."
7188,tt0473310,6628,3,"The choice of angles, choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story."
7189,tt0473310,6628,4,"Oh, if the songs and dances haven't caused you to rip your ears off your head, first."
7190,tt0473310,6628,5,"The film could have been made twice at 1.25 hours, and been pretty good, kinda like ""Seven Samurai"" but the director and writer didn't go that direction, even if the ""townsfolk"" finally find their backbone and want to help."
7191,tt0473310,6628,6,"This movie fails on so many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script name any aspect of this film it was BAD probably the food from the caterer was bad too."
7192,tt0473310,6628,7,I have never in 6 years of watching Indian Bollywood movies seen something this badly made.
7193,tt0473310,6629,1,"If you have seen the Sholay of 1975, Don't watch this movie."
7194,tt0473310,6629,2,"If you have NOT seen the Sholay of 1975, Go WATCH IT."
7195,tt0473310,6629,3,But do not watch this movie.
7196,tt0473310,6629,4,This movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of Sholay.
7197,tt0473310,6629,5,Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best Probably the only 40 mins of the reel that shouldn't be burnt.
7198,tt0473310,6629,6,"If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with his character, it would still be worth a watch."
7199,tt0473310,6629,7,But as Insp.
7200,tt0473310,6629,8,"Narsimha, Mohanlal doesn't do justice to his talent."
7201,tt0473310,6629,9,"Ajay DevganHeero is extremely mundane and the only reason i think, they cast Prashant Raj in the role of Raj is because he has a striking resemblance to Amitabh of his young days."
7202,tt0473310,6629,10,"Sushmita Sen carries herself well, with grace and make up."
7203,tt0473310,6629,11,"But the award for the ""WORST performance and any role till date"" must go to Nisha Kothari."
7204,tt0473310,6629,12,She manages to degrade her acting to such levels that even high school drama would would outshine her performance.
7205,tt0473310,6629,13,"If you have a mortal enemy, take him to this movie. :"
7206,tt0473310,6630,1,This so called remake is terrible.
7207,tt0473310,6630,2,I went to see this tonight.. on the first day as the anticipation and hype was too much for me to handle.
7208,tt0473310,6630,3,"But within the first half an hour, we knew that this is a disaster."
7209,tt0473310,6630,4,It not only does not match the hype created but also insults the original blockbuster.
7210,tt0473310,6630,5,"The script had loopholes, the editing was untidy quite a few times."
7211,tt0473310,6630,6,Mohanlal who is an excellent actor did an okay job.
7212,tt0473310,6630,7,Amitabh was alright.. the director wanted to portray how evil his character is but he went a bit overboard which resulted in it being forceful.
7213,tt0473310,6630,8,Ajay who is especially smooth in these kind of roles was also a disappointment.
7214,tt0473310,6630,9,Lets not even get started about the new guy Prashant.. one wouldn't be proud to start off a career with something like this.
7215,tt0473310,6630,10,Rajpal Yadav who was thrown in for a few laughs couldn't even get a smile out of anyone because of his forceful humor and the shrill voice.
7216,tt0473310,6630,11,Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today.
7217,tt0473310,6630,12,"All in all, RGV who I thought was one of the most talented and gifted directors India has had.. failed miserably."
7218,tt0473310,6630,13,He took up such a huge challenge and responsibility to remake what is known as the best Hindi movie ever and made a mess out of it.
7219,tt0473310,6631,1,Ram Gopal Verma has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director.
7220,tt0473310,6631,2,"He had done a remake/reworking of Godfather with Sarkar, and succeeded tremendously."
7221,tt0473310,6631,3,Ditto for Lolita which he made as Nishaabd.
7222,tt0473310,6631,4,Sholay is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most.
7223,tt0473310,6631,5,"Unfortunately, he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake."
7224,tt0473310,6631,6,"The acting ranged from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan being suitably menacing as the villain Babban."
7225,tt0473310,6631,7,The songs were awful and forgettable.
7226,tt0473310,6631,8,The Mehbooba Mehbooba song came off as a second rate music video.
7227,tt0473310,6631,9,"The worst part was the pacing, and the dialogues which were forgettable."
7228,tt0473310,6631,10,"Watching the movie in a theatre, I found myself waiting for the intermission, and then for the ending."
7229,tt0473310,6631,11,"Some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film."
7230,tt0473310,6631,12,"Ultimately, one of the worst movies made by Ram Gopal Verma."
7231,tt0473310,6632,1,What on earth has become of our dear Ramu.
7232,tt0473310,6632,2,"Is this the same man who made Sarkar, Satya, and Comapny."
7233,tt0473310,6632,3,I refuse to believe so.
7234,tt0473310,6632,4,"If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he has clearly jumped off the high cliff he has ascended by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all times."
7235,tt0473310,6632,5,This movie is made to fall like a brick.
7236,tt0473310,6632,6,"I was cringing to leave the theater, but I was forced to sit because I wouldn't have been able to take my car out of the parking lot before others also left."
7237,tt0473310,6632,7,"Else, nothing would have made me sit beyond interval."
7238,tt0473310,6632,8,This movie is nowhere close to Sholay.
7239,tt0473310,6632,9,It doesn't even come near it within a mile.
7240,tt0473310,6632,10,"I believe Ramu surely loves The Godfather more than Sholay, since Sarkar was a classic piece of work."
7241,tt0473310,6632,11,"I read Ramu's interview a couple of days back, in which the interviewer said that Ramu doesn't sleep for more than 4 hours a day, that too not at a stretch."
7242,tt0473310,6632,12,"I completely agree with this now, as his lack of sleep has probably taken its toll on the movie."
7243,tt0473310,6632,13,There is no power in the performance.
7244,tt0473310,6632,14,Amitabh Bachchan doesn't even look scary.
7245,tt0473310,6632,15,He looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers I saw earlier.
7246,tt0473310,6632,16,Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she didn't have many dialogs in fact none if I remember clearly.
7247,tt0473310,6632,17,"She opened her mouth in this movie, and has found a place in history."
7248,tt0473310,6632,18,"The new guy playing Jai's role seems to have that brash look, but didn't manage Jai's role at all."
7249,tt0473310,6632,19,I cant go on...
7250,tt0473310,6632,20,Im sorry... my pain is too big for me to manage right now.
7251,tt0473310,6632,21,I promised myself throughout the movie that I will watch the original Sholay once more just to see that it is still there.
7252,tt0473310,6632,22,Bottom Line: Horrible movie.
7253,tt0473310,6632,23,The media and critics are going to cook Ramu's goose.
7254,tt0473310,6632,24,"And just to remind all readers once more, I am one of the biggest Ramu fans, and even I cant spare him for this act."
7255,tt0865957,9541,1,I suppose many people comment/review their first movie on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or horrible I'm writing due to the latter.
7256,tt0865957,9541,2,"I was excited for the sequel to ""Wargames"" .."
7257,tt0865957,9541,3,"I thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content, I felt it was worth watching more than once."
7258,tt0865957,9541,4,"This being 2008, I had high hopes for what they would do with this film."
7259,tt0865957,9541,5,"Computers, Gaming, Terror, Military over zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film, and ""Wargames: The Dead Code"" had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick."
7260,tt0865957,9541,6,"The movie failed on pretty much every level, but I particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects."
7261,tt0865957,9541,7,"""The Dead Code"" was a 1990's air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms."
7262,tt0865957,9541,8,"Meanwhile, Will Farmer is button mashing about 7,000 commands none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen."
7263,tt0865957,9541,9,"Until finally he ""wins"" by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people nobody is near the gas."
7264,tt0865957,9541,10,"Because he beat 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes, this tells RIPLEY the real life war machine that he is a high level terror threat."
7265,tt0865957,9541,11,Even though any 5 16 year old could complete this same task The government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity.
7266,tt0865957,9541,12,"They say things like ""He has expert knowledge of bio terror"" ..."
7267,tt0865957,9541,13,He displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the Wiki entry on Bio Terror.
7268,tt0865957,9541,14,So then a movie long chase scene with about .01% of the budget and excitement of any of the Bourne titles ensues.
7269,tt0865957,9541,15,They have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter.. sometimes they are mad they barely miss him.. but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him.
7270,tt0865957,9541,16,Ugh...
7271,tt0865957,9541,17,"I would write more.. but I already wasted 1.5 hours watching this, I would rather watch the Broderick and Joshua play tic tac toe for 1.5 hours."
7272,tt0865957,9542,1,I don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said.
7273,tt0865957,9542,2,Honestly I have only myself to be angry with.
7274,tt0865957,9542,3,"I should have know better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but I loved War Games so I indulged my whim."
7275,tt0865957,9542,4,I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life.
7276,tt0865957,9542,5,From the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game I knew I was in for a ride though the land that good writing forgot.
7277,tt0865957,9542,6,"The list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so long I would crash IMDb if I tried to post it."
7278,tt0865957,9542,7,To those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me.
7279,tt0865957,9542,8,I am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung.
7280,tt0865957,9543,1,"Let's face it if you rented a STDVD sequel of a forgotten 80's gem, and expected it to be better than the aforementioned, then you are an idiot."
7281,tt0865957,9543,2,Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has filled so easily.
7282,tt0865957,9543,3,"Movies like this don't need spoilers, because YOU already know them."
7283,tt0865957,9543,4,"The ""plot"" for this ""film"", is as follows: Nerd meets girl; girl likes nerd; nerd likes girl; nerd gets accidentally involved with Top Secret Government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by Government suits in the other country; nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the ""film""; nerd and girl are captured; the Top Secret Government computer gets crazy; nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer; nerd beats Top Secret Computer by using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames ""film""; nerd saves the day; nerd gets laid."
7284,tt0865957,9543,5,The end.
7285,tt0865957,9543,6,"The acting, script, effects, score, and cinematography are what you would expect B grade."
7286,tt0865957,9543,7,"Some familiar faces are in here, and unless you are a mega fan of Colm Feore, then you should avoid this one."
7287,tt0865957,9543,8,"Granted, the movie won't make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it, so if you like cheap looking STDVD sequels, then you are right at home."
7288,tt0865957,9543,9,"Sadly, Mathew Broderick was too involved with some ""masterpiece"", that he couldn't even do a five second cameo in this one."
7289,tt0865957,9543,10,But can you blame him.
7290,tt0865957,9544,1,I didn't enjoy this film.
7291,tt0865957,9544,2,I thought the acting wasn't very good and the story was boring.
7292,tt0865957,9544,3,A 20year old computer saving the day.
7293,tt0865957,9544,4,"I thought that this was just slightly far fetched, even for a film."
7294,tt0865957,9544,5,"I couldn't figure out why they couldn't just turn it off, why not take a sledgehammer to it."
7295,tt0865957,9544,6,"Its a shame, but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered."
7296,tt0865957,9544,7,"This film could have been a 21st century version of the old film, it wasn't."
7297,tt0865957,9544,8,"If that is what you want to watch, do not watch this film!"
7298,tt0865957,9544,9,"Even if the old computer hadn't have turned up to save day, this would still, in my opinion, be a very very cheesy flick.."
7299,tt0865957,9545,1,"Will Farmer Lanter plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and Ripley, the super government computer, designed to profile potential terrorists, tracks him because Will borrowed by hacking some money from his next door neighbor's bank account to pay for a class trip to play chess in Philadelphia."
7300,tt0865957,9545,2,"The next door neighbor whose computer Will was fixing, has relatives in the mid east who thru their bank send money to the neighbor's bank , and Ripley sees a terrorist connection."
7301,tt0865957,9545,3,Ripley has the power to call up missile strikes.
7302,tt0865957,9545,4,"Oh, oh!"
7303,tt0865957,9545,5,This version of War Games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the War Games movie in the early 1980s.
7304,tt0865957,9545,6,"Well, the electronic industry has so much more to work with these days."
7305,tt0865957,9545,7,Makes sense.
7306,tt0865957,9545,8,"So the movie dazzles us with fantastic CGI on computer screens, and once Joshua, the forerunner to Ripley, is found operational, we are left with watching computer against computer and the humans are cringing, hoping, praying¬Ö.sort of, oh oh ing, OMG ing, and more cringing hoping things will go their way."
7307,tt0865957,9545,9,"In other words we are now experiencing a made for TV type movie, and it's Oh Hum Time."
7308,tt0865957,9545,10,Go back to the 1980s and watch the original War Games movie.
7309,tt0865957,9545,11,It's much better.
7310,tt0865957,9545,12,"But, we really have to ask ourselves: are we making computers too intelligent where one day, in time, they will rule us."
7311,tt0865957,9545,13,Hmmm¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö..
7312,tt0865957,9545,14,Violence: Yes.
7313,tt0865957,9545,15,Sex: No.
7314,tt0865957,9545,16,Nudity: No.
7315,tt0865957,9545,17,Language: No.
7316,tt0865957,9546,1,If you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece.
7317,tt0865957,9546,2,How could it be worse more you ask.
7318,tt0865957,9546,3,Well...at least in the first one you had Ally Sheedy jogging in a sports bra.
7319,tt0865957,9546,4,"Other than updated graphics, modern day themes such as terrorists, modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story."
7320,tt0865957,9546,5,Anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story was going.
7321,tt0865957,9546,6,And for anyone that didn't see the first one...well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once.
7322,tt0865957,9546,7,Maybe in another 23 years Hollywood will try again.
7323,tt0865957,9547,1,A below average looking video game is turned into some sort of conspiracy to have the next terrorist discovered in the USA backyard.
7324,tt0865957,9547,2,Welcome to the lunacy of cheaply made direct to video movies.
7325,tt0865957,9547,3,Its full of no name actors and actresses with little valuable plot.
7326,tt0865957,9547,4,"Anyway, this strange game goes on and our ""hero"" bets real money and does good at it."
7327,tt0865957,9547,5,"It is sort of like gambling, except the gambling part is gone and it sucks."
7328,tt0865957,9547,6,Instead its an online game with little real value and you get authorities on your tail if you do good.
7329,tt0865957,9547,7,What makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs battle it out somehow and all is saved in the end.
7330,tt0865957,9547,8,I will leave the viewer to see how it all comes to fruition.
7331,tt0865957,9547,9,"Overall, not even worth a $1 rental."
7332,tt0865957,9547,10,"Borrow it, please."
7333,tt0865957,9547,11,"""D """
7334,tt0865957,9548,1,I can't believe I watched this expecting more.
7335,tt0865957,9548,2,It starts out OK.
7336,tt0865957,9548,3,This movie pushes the limits of reality way to far!!
7337,tt0865957,9548,4,At least the first one was somewhat realistic.
7338,tt0865957,9548,5,It rips off the first movie and even mentions the Joshua Project.
7339,tt0865957,9548,6,Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie.
7340,tt0865957,9548,7,"It does have one good message in it though, WATCH OUT FOR BIG BROTHER!!!"
7341,tt0865957,9548,8,The movie just makes it seem like Big Brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality.
7342,tt0865957,9548,9,That was very aggravating.
7343,tt0865957,9548,10,Even the make up on the actors was completely bad.
7344,tt0865957,9548,11,Some of the acting is pretty good.
7345,tt0865957,9548,12,Some of the acting is really bad though.
7346,tt0865957,9548,13,The script was OK at some points and completely messed up at other parts.
7347,tt0865957,9548,14,This movie plays on convenience about every five minutes.
7348,tt0865957,9548,15,"Like I said, I can't believe I watched it expecting more."
7349,tt0865957,9548,16,I think I am gonna pop in the original to get back to earth...
7350,tt0865957,9548,17,Q
7351,tt0865957,9549,1,I wondered why John Wood was not playing Dr.
7352,tt0865957,9549,2,Falken until I watched the film.
7353,tt0865957,9549,3,"BAD plot, bad science, bad acting and overall a bad film."
7354,tt0865957,9549,4,Please don't watch this film.
7355,tt0865957,9549,5,"Rent the original ""War Games"" if you are feeling nostalgic."
7356,tt0865957,9549,6,I didn't like the bending of the plot to beat the terrorist threat idea either.
7357,tt0865957,9549,7,In the first film W.O.P.R was built because Russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the U.S.A.
7358,tt0865957,9549,8,In this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat.
7359,tt0865957,9549,9,"Politics aside, one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end."
7360,tt0865957,9549,10,No such insight is offered in this film.
7361,tt0865957,9550,1,"After Highlander 2 which I am still in denial about, I thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad."
7362,tt0865957,9550,2,I was wrong.
7363,tt0865957,9550,3,"I loved the original Wargames, however, this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie."
7364,tt0865957,9550,4,The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked.
7365,tt0865957,9550,5,Whoever wrote this movie knew NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS except how to use a word processor.
7366,tt0865957,9550,6,I doubt he or she even watched the original movie.
7367,tt0865957,9550,7,The acting isn't even convincing.
7368,tt0865957,9550,8,"Please save yourselves, under no circumstances watch this movie."
7369,tt0865957,9550,9,I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn the TV off.
7370,tt0865957,9550,10,THIS MOVIE WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE.
7371,tt0865957,9551,1,This is one of the worse movies that I have ever seen in my entire life.
7372,tt0865957,9551,2,"I wish I could travel back in time and do the following:1 Find out where the ""movie"" ""War Games The Dead Code"" was filmed 2 Watch the original WAR GAMES with my current computer knowledge AND the eyes of a 1983 preteen."
7373,tt0865957,9551,3,3 Break into the pentagon computer in the 80's with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered.
7374,tt0865957,9551,4,"4 Reprogram the WHOPPER to NUKE the location of THE DEAD CODE minutes prior to its first day of filming 5 Come back to the present, have a beer and get Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to ""flash"" my memory blank of the whole event, especially my original viewing of ""The Dead Code"" 6 Have another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7 Be happy until the next bad remake of a GOOD 80's movie.8 Did I forget the have Jar Jar killed."
7375,tt0865957,9551,5,I am not sure if I would have to travel into the future for that.
7376,tt0865957,9551,6,Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
7377,tt0865957,9552,1,Just plain good old stupid.
7378,tt0865957,9552,2,"I mean really stupid, not the good stupid like Killer Tomatoes, or Ed Wood movies, this is probably the most stupid movie I ever have seen."
7379,tt0865957,9552,3,To give this movie an golden Turkey is an insult to turkeys.
7380,tt0865957,9552,4,To call this movie dumb is offensive even to dumb people.
7381,tt0865957,9552,5,If this is the future of American cinema and art we are better off to really start world war 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after.
7382,tt0865957,9552,6,Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult to my single braincell off....
7383,tt0865957,9552,7,This is a really good movie if you are suicidal.
7384,tt0865957,9553,1,"No wonder this was released straight to DVD here in Australia, no redeeming features what so ever."
7385,tt0865957,9553,2,"The dialog was hokey, the acting, awful and the script sucked!!"
7386,tt0865957,9553,3,"Whoever thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or follow up to the far superior John Badham film, Wargames from the 80s, well they must of been on something cause it was a bad idea!!"
7387,tt0865957,9553,4,"Amanda Walsh was good in it as the eye candy/love interest, while Matt Lanter was good as the other main lead that is about it."
7388,tt0865957,9553,5,"I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code to anyone, check out Hackers or the original Wargames film both are better than this piece of crap!!"
7389,tt0865957,9554,1,"This is the worst, and I mean THE worst computers based movie I have ever seen."
7390,tt0865957,9554,2,The whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity.
7391,tt0865957,9554,3,I mean...
7392,tt0865957,9554,4,The guy in this movie can actually speak with computer as a real person.
7393,tt0865957,9554,5,"Now you probably think this must be some super cool high tech computer, well , it is, but he does it also with other very poor and weak computer which does not even have graphic interface.and the main idea how to overload the ""super"" computer by connecting to it via computer game on the net is really stupid."
7394,tt0865957,9554,6,My mobile phone will shut the lighting down to preserve the energy but apparently this genius computer cant decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to load computer games.there are also some other bad things about it but I just don't have time for this.
7395,tt0865957,9554,7,I just cant believe someone could actually record movie stupid as this
7396,tt0865957,9555,1,"You have to understand, when Wargames was released in 1983, it created a generation of wannabe computer hackers."
7397,tt0865957,9555,2,"The idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions, let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling."
7398,tt0865957,9555,3,"Real computers were beginning to show up in people's homes, and for the first time, society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movie's premise excitingly prescient."
7399,tt0865957,9555,4,"Granted, a talking computer that balanced it's free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched, but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it."
7400,tt0865957,9555,5,I've probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based on.
7401,tt0865957,9555,6,"Fast forward 25 years, and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that I loathe to call a ""sequel"", called Wargames: The Dead Code."
7402,tt0865957,9555,7,I'll just dig right in.
7403,tt0865957,9555,8,"First of all, the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects."
7404,tt0865957,9555,9,You're probably very confused right now.
7405,tt0865957,9555,10,"The idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the sub game within the web site called ""The Dead Code"" where they pilot a plane over a city, spraying it with bioweapons."
7406,tt0865957,9555,11,"At some point in the game, you have to choose between ""sarin gas"" and ""anthrax"", and if you choose ""sarin"", then you're automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated."
7407,tt0865957,9555,12,"In the movie, this actually happens."
7408,tt0865957,9555,13,"However, since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious, it obviously all makes sense."
7409,tt0865957,9555,14,"Second, the avatar of the AI in this straight to DVD bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the pop up ad esquire sound bite ""play with me baby""."
7410,tt0865957,9555,15,"Because apparently in the future, advanced AI loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess, and gets into porn."
7411,tt0865957,9555,16,"Third, the motivation for these ""hackers"" is profit and women, as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie."
7412,tt0865957,9555,17,"For some reason, recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else."
7413,tt0865957,9555,18,"That may work for your average sitcom, but c'mon, you don't learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair, playing sports, and shopping at the mall, folks."
7414,tt0865957,9555,19,"The one novel thing I noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a Matt Damon movie, and then later there is the phrase, ""Good Hunting, Will""."
7415,tt0865957,9555,20,"I swear, they named the main character Will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to Mr."
7416,tt0865957,9555,21,Damon.
7417,tt0865957,9555,22,"This Will kid isn't bad, but he was certainly wasn't like any obsessive hacker I've ever met."
7418,tt0865957,9555,23,"I can't fully state how annoyed I am that this movie shares the same name as the original, because it has absolutely nothing in common with it except¬Ö Professor Falken and Joshua WOPR make a reappearance in this movie, as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom, and a dilapidated old tic tac toe machine with a higher pitched voice."
7419,tt0865957,9555,24,"After some prodding, Joshua the AI has what appears to be sex with the new AI with the porn voice, a bunch of board games flash on the big screens, and the whole ""The only way to win, is not to play"" revelation is supposed to be the crowning moment."
7420,tt0865957,9555,25,"Except that those of us who saw the original, you know, those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that."
7421,tt0865957,9555,26,A recycled ending for a movie made from last month's compost.
7422,tt0865957,9555,27,"The new movie was directed by a guy who's done 90210, and written by guys who do B movies."
7423,tt0865957,9555,28,"The original was directed by a guy who's been keeping himself busy with ""Heroes"", so you see the quality difference there."
7424,tt0865957,9555,29,"There was talk of a real remake, but I hope they don't destroy this classic all over again."
7425,tt0865957,9555,30,"I swear, if I have to, I'll visit every gambling web site until I find the one that's run by a psychotic government computer."
7426,tt0865957,9555,31,"The saving grace is that I was able to stream this on Netflix, so at least the only energy I expended watching this disaster was for breathing, clicking, and indigestion."
7427,tt0865957,9556,1,This movie is mostly chase scenes and special effects.
7428,tt0865957,9556,2,It is very weak on plot.
7429,tt0865957,9556,3,Most of the computer talk was just mumbo jumbo.
7430,tt0865957,9556,4,I watched this because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie which was based mostly on computer fact and real computer terminology.
7431,tt0865957,9556,5,This movie had none of that.
7432,tt0865957,9556,6,"Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks, but just lame."
7433,tt0865957,9556,7,It is like it was written by somebody who has no comprehension of real computers.
7434,tt0865957,9556,8,The ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game.
7435,tt0865957,9556,9,"No real hacking, so what was the point."
7436,tt0865957,9556,10,Movie was boring.
7437,tt0865957,9556,11,Lame sequel.
7438,tt0865957,9557,1,I really didn't have high expectations and I must admit that I wasn't disappointed.
7439,tt0865957,9557,2,This movie is so terrible that I felt obligated to register an account here at IMDb just to warn others not to waste their time.
7440,tt0865957,9557,3,"The storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie ""can it get any worse."""
7441,tt0865957,9557,4,"YES, it can!"
7442,tt0865957,9557,5,"somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking ""I want my 1 hour 35 minutes back!""."
7443,tt0865957,9557,6,Somebody got to pay for this!
7444,tt0865957,9557,7,I dare you to find a movie which is worst that this...
7445,tt0865957,9557,8,I really didn't have high expectations and I must admit that I wasn't disappointed.
7446,tt0865957,9557,9,This movie is so terrible that I felt obligated to register an account here at IMDb just to warn others not to waste their time.
7447,tt0865957,9557,10,"The storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie ""can it get any worse."""
7448,tt0865957,9557,11,"YES, it can!"
7449,tt0865957,9557,12,"somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking ""I want my 1 hour 35 minutes back!""."
7450,tt0865957,9557,13,Somebody got to pay for this!
7451,tt0865957,9557,14,I dare you to find a movie which is worst that this...
7452,tt0865957,9558,1,"I thought this was a sequel of some sorts, and it is meant to be to the original from 1983."
7453,tt0865957,9558,2,But a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it.
7454,tt0865957,9558,3,"I actually had very little expectations to this movie, but I just wasted 95 minutes of life."
7455,tt0865957,9558,4,"No suspense I actually feel clairvoyant, poor acting, and so filled with technical errors, so I as a computer geek just couldn't believe it."
7456,tt0865957,9558,5,They have tried to make it a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours.
7457,tt0865957,9558,6,But this is not even worthy of a low budget TV movie.
7458,tt0865957,9558,7,"Do not see this movie, this is a complete waste of time."
7459,tt0865957,9558,8,Instead get the original.
7460,tt0865957,9558,9,The theme is still valid.
7461,tt0865957,9558,10,Don't let to much power into a machine.
7462,tt0865957,9558,11,And the acting and plot is far more exiting and compelling.
7463,tt0865957,9559,1,I'll try to use words to describe this on....
7464,tt0865957,9559,2,"I saw the original, which was good in its own way, but back then I should have feared a sequel."
7465,tt0865957,9559,3,"And I was 'afraid' when I picked this one up, but now that I've seen it, I have to say, it's even worse then I thought."
7466,tt0865957,9559,4,Why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin.
7467,tt0865957,9559,5,"Let's start with the actors;they aren't all that good, but it has to be said, some make heads turn by being just plain awful."
7468,tt0865957,9559,6,But what can an actor do with a script like this one.
7469,tt0865957,9559,7,"It's trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed, any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasn't been done before, fails miserably."
7470,tt0865957,9559,8,"In a futile attempt to get it up to date, they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole 'big brother' theme , but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end."
7471,tt0865957,9559,9,"An attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the '83 original, but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad."
7472,tt0865957,9559,10,"In conclusion, if you have nothing , and I mean nothing , to do... go watch it, or play Frisbee... with the DVD.... by yourself."
7473,tt0865957,9559,11,It'll offer you the same amount of fun..
7474,tt0865957,9559,12,I promise
7475,tt0865957,9560,1,Thank God I watched this at a friend's place and did not pay for it.
7476,tt0865957,9560,2,The plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a TV show.
7477,tt0865957,9560,3,"If you have any knowledge of computers or electronics, watch out."
7478,tt0865957,9560,4,You will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence.
7479,tt0865957,9560,5,"Also, actress turned Much Music VJ Amanda Walsh displays the worst acting I have ever seen, excluding porn."
7480,tt0865957,9560,6,She's lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent.
7481,tt0865957,9560,7,He's the one that carries the movie.
7482,tt0865957,9560,8,I hate that I wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie!
7483,tt0865957,9560,9,"It's a shame that they got to call it a sequel, because I was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good."
7484,tt0865957,9561,1,"Like many others have commented before me here, I have to say that this movie is bad, but not the worst I've seen."
7485,tt0865957,9561,2,"There will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment, because I hate spoilers."
7486,tt0865957,9561,3,"I got a feeling I was watching an episode of a TV show or something, where they had gotten a hold of some extra $$$ to spend on CGI I've seen worse of those..."
7487,tt0865957,9561,4,"All in all, it is quite an insult to the viewer, at least if you have ANY knowledge about computers and/or technology at all."
7488,tt0865957,9561,5,"There are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable, and I found myself just begging for it all to end fast halfway through."
7489,tt0865957,9561,6,"In addition, there are countless ""easy way out"" scenarios, which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being..."
7490,tt0865957,9561,7,"This movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old ""Wargames"", and I think it's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel."
7491,tt0865957,9561,8,"Two stars from me, because of one thing and one thing only: the actors' performances aren't half bad, considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with."
7492,tt0865957,9561,9,"Still, they should never have signed on to this movie."
7493,tt0865957,9561,10,"Not really a career move, but I guess we all have bills to pay."
7494,tt0865957,9561,11,"To those of you who gave this movie top score...you have to be on the studio's payroll or something, that's my only explanation."
7495,tt0865957,9561,12,"To all who haven't seen this one: by all means, watch it and make up your own mind."
7496,tt0865957,9561,13,But lower your expectations to the floor and then some.
7497,tt0865957,9562,1,"I think this could've been a decent movie, and some of its parts are OK... but in whole it's a B movie."
7498,tt0865957,9562,2,"Same about the plot, parts are OK but it has several holes and oddities that doesn't quite add up."
7499,tt0865957,9562,3,"Acting is mostly OK, I've seen worse of this too. :The beginning sets the level, with cars driving in the desert, making ""cool"" but totally unnecessary jumps through some small dunes In slow motion!"
7500,tt0865957,9562,4,"Cool!, like the drivers had never seen sand before..."
7501,tt0865957,9562,5,"It gets slightly better from there, but not much."
7502,tt0865957,9562,6,"If you're gonna rent this, get another one too and use this one as a warm up."
7503,tt0865957,9562,7,Keep expectations low and it might work for you.
7504,tt0865957,9563,1,This is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hit .
7505,tt0865957,9563,2,It's set in the modern day as we see a base in Afghanistan get destroyed by a UAV right at the start.
7506,tt0865957,9563,3,And that's exactly where the movie jumps the shark.
7507,tt0865957,9563,4,UAV's aren't armed.
7508,tt0865957,9563,5,They could be but I don't think it's ever been tried for real.
7509,tt0865957,9563,6,"We get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y."
7510,tt0865957,9563,7,"We are introduced to ""hacker"" Will Farmer he's good at chemistry & electronics which doesn't make him a computer hacker & his love interest, Annie & Will's 1st attempt at hacking is not only a complete failure his IP address is also logged and Annie guessed who it was."
7511,tt0865957,9563,8,We also meet Wills mom who works for a chemical company.
7512,tt0865957,9563,9,"Wills taking money from his neighbours bank account Mr Massude isn't a hack he helped him set up the account, we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing Global Thermonuclear War & they play The Dead Code."
7513,tt0865957,9563,10,The trace the RIPLEY office are running is NOT on Will but on Massude's pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against Will.
7514,tt0865957,9563,11,Exactly why RIPLEY shut Will's machine down isn't explained he's only playing an online game. & also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well.
7515,tt0865957,9563,12,Why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable.
7516,tt0865957,9563,13,As for RIPLEY activating his mobile phone.
7517,tt0865957,9563,14,"I think not, it wasn't connected to the pc and the message wouldn't play unless he actually answered the phone so there's more bad ""hacking"" science there too."
7518,tt0865957,9563,15,"RIPLEY agents arrive at Massude's home, take him away & Will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money."
7519,tt0865957,9563,16,"Will searching for the licence plate of the car that took Massude isn't a ""hack"" as you never see him break into the DMV computer."
7520,tt0865957,9563,17,The RIPLEY agents who grab Dennis in the airport as he's looking for Will have no authority to arrest or detain him.
7521,tt0865957,9563,18,"Will's mother hadn't ""been stealing chemicals & Bio agents"" either."
7522,tt0865957,9563,19,And even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain Dennis.
7523,tt0865957,9563,20,Patriot Act or not.
7524,tt0865957,9563,21,"I don't know why Will was worried about being arrested for any crime in Canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the US.The computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against Will, his mother & Dennis wasn't sanctioned by a Government agency."
7525,tt0865957,9563,22,"The phone phreak we see Will do is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie, we also get a hack into RIPLEY which seemed too easy for such a powerful system."
7526,tt0865957,9563,23,"The ""guy"" who ran into Annie at the airport & was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with RIPLEY & the laughable notion that RIPLEY could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips."
7527,tt0865957,9563,24,"Another reference to the original movie when they mention Stephen Falken as the designer of the system RIPLEY replaced, the Joshua Project."
7528,tt0865957,9563,25,"We discover that the ""guy"" who ran into Annie is Falken not played by the original actor sadly who faked his own death."
7529,tt0865957,9563,26,"We also get to see WOPR as ""what's going to help"" them beat RIPLEY and they kept the same voice used back then."
7530,tt0865957,9563,27,"Falken & WOPR are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all the same explosion should kill Will, Annie & the Russian."
7531,tt0865957,9563,28,It's also unlikely they'd create a self contained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of.
7532,tt0865957,9563,29,"The whole ""Decontamination"" plot & idea are totally unbelievable."
7533,tt0865957,9563,30,Those kinds of orders would have to go through the President or Joint Chiefs Of Staff.
7534,tt0865957,9563,31,So yet another laughable & unbelievable idea.
7535,tt0865957,9563,32,"The IP hacks against RIPLEY aren't done by Will, he just contacts one of his friends who suggests & implements the idea."
7536,tt0865957,9563,33,It's excessively laughable that Will would get a login just from increasing RIPLEY's operating temperature.
7537,tt0865957,9563,34,Having Joshua as a backdoor into RIPLEY especially after it had been blown to bits is an incredible cop out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with.
7538,tt0865957,9563,35,"There is an awful good where RIPLEY is playing Dead Code and we see a countdown saying 17 minutes then RIPLEY says ""Decontamination in 30 minutes"", how crap is that when they can't even keep up with their own timer."
7539,tt0865957,9563,36,RIPLEY's attack mission against Philadelphia is halted far too easily in my opinion and it decides to attack Joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a Philly to Washington where RIPLEY is stationed.
7540,tt0865957,9563,37,The idea of the Nuclear exchange to make RIPLEY realise what she's doing won't work surely she'd already know if she had Joshua insider her as he'd already learnt this lesson in the original movie. is yet another nod back to the original movie.
7541,tt0865957,9563,38,Their cop out at having RIPLEY repeat Joshua's exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with.
7542,tt0865957,9563,39,If you want to point fingers for bad & stolen ideas the men to blame are Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner.
7543,tt0865957,9563,40,This is an awful movie and is best avoided.
7544,tt0865957,9564,1,"Some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen, and I understand where they're coming from, but I really have seen worse."
7545,tt0865957,9564,2,"That being said, the movies that I can recall ie the ones I haven't blocked out that were worse than this, were so bad that they physically pained every sense that was involved with watching the movie."
7546,tt0865957,9564,3,"The movies that are worse than War Games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes, or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness."
7547,tt0865957,9564,4,"War Games: The Dead Code isn't that bad, but it comes pretty close."
7548,tt0865957,9564,5,"Yes I was a fan of the original, but no I wasn't expecting miracles from this one."
7549,tt0865957,9564,6,"Let's face it the original wasn't really that great of a movie in the first place, it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek appeal to it."
7550,tt0865957,9564,7,"That's all I was hoping for, something bad, but that might have tugged at my geek strings."
7551,tt0865957,9564,8,Was that too much to ask for.
7552,tt0865957,9564,9,"Is it really not possible to do better than the original War Games, even for a straight to video release."
7553,tt0865957,9564,10,Well apparently that was too much to ask for.
7554,tt0865957,9564,11,Stay away from this movie.
7555,tt0865957,9564,12,"At first it's just bad, like ""Oh yeah, this is bad, but I'm kind of enjoying it, maybe the end will be good like in the original."""
7556,tt0865957,9564,13,"And then it just gets worse and worse, and by the end, trust me, you will wish you had not seen this movie."
7557,tt0865957,9565,1,"I can't say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen, as it had one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent movie I've ever seen."
7558,tt0865957,9565,2,Not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10+ minutes in advance.
7559,tt0865957,9565,3,"There was no subtlety to anything the movie did, no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes."
7560,tt0865957,9565,4,"Every spoken or typed line's intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to ""get into"" the movie."
7561,tt0865957,9565,5,"I found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line, and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience, far more often than I found myself enjoying the movie."
7562,tt0865957,9566,1,I see a lot of movies.
7563,tt0865957,9566,2,Saw the original wargames years ago and loved it.
7564,tt0865957,9566,3,"Computers where still ""a big mystery"" for the most of us and the movie was convincing, in it's own way."
7565,tt0865957,9566,4,"This one, however, looks like a low budget Wednesday night special."
7566,tt0865957,9566,5,"Total crap, from start to finish."
7567,tt0865957,9566,6,"The plot is so weak, you won't believe it until you see the movie which I would not recommend in the first place."
7568,tt0865957,9566,7,I can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie.
7569,tt0865957,9566,8,"But hey, with that script I would've been surprised if ANYONE could do a good job acting."
7570,tt0865957,9566,9,Lots of clich√© scenes.
7571,tt0865957,9566,10,CGI looks like it's taken out of the '86 version.
7572,tt0865957,9566,11,"Bah, no, I'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this."
7573,tt0865957,9566,12,Do NOT watch this movie.
7574,tt0865957,9566,13,Life's to short to waste it on watching crappy movies.
7575,tt0865957,9567,1,"It happened with Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with The Lost Boys in 2008 and now it's happened with another classic from the 80's Wargames... : Why, oh why, oh why won't Hollywood ever learn."
7576,tt0865957,9567,2,Leave them alone...!
7577,tt0865957,9567,3,They can't be remade...!
7578,tt0865957,9567,4,They suck....!
7579,tt0865957,9567,5,We all hate them....!.
7580,tt0865957,9567,6,"Those of you who haven't seen the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick & Ally Sheedy, go rent/buy it now....!!"
7581,tt0865957,9567,7,"The hardware may look dated, the special effects are not new millennium but it still beats this rubbish hands down...."
7582,tt0865957,9567,8,"For those of us who lived through the 80's when hacking was sexy, the Internet was something mysterious and your disks came as a 8"" floppy variety, well we now possess the wisdom to avoid this film like a Thermonuclear War!"
7583,tt0865957,9567,9,"Never before has ""a nice game of chess"" seemed the better option...."
7584,tt0887971,1207,1,"Kim Basinger stars as Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband, who gets into trouble while she's out at the local mall doing some last minute Christmas shopping."
7585,tt0887971,1207,2,"After placing a hastily scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper and sticking said paper in the windshield of a car that took up two parking spaces, she finds out the owners of the car are the Rainbow Coilition of villains comprising of a white guy, a Mexican, a Chinese guy & a black."
7586,tt0887971,1207,3,"They confront her about the note, cap a helpless security guard, and the chase is on."
7587,tt0887971,1207,4,During the course of the film Della will go for hunted to hunter as she unleashes her inner Bronson.
7588,tt0887971,1207,5,I found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller.
7589,tt0887971,1207,6,"The acting was good enough except for a few scenes, the ""Why God why"" bit was cringe worthy in it's badness though It comes undone a bit due to the sheer fact that the villains Della chases from/after are mind numbingly stupid."
7590,tt0887971,1207,7,"If they hadn't had the intellect of any given ""Home Alone"" baddie, perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the meh reaction it evokes."
7591,tt0887971,1207,8,"The unbelievability factor I'm willing to overlook as both the director & one of the producers had part in bringing ""Shoot em up"" to the screen a film which while throwing credibility out the window was immensely fun."
7592,tt0887971,1207,9,"This film while never attaining the heights of that film, was good in it's own rights."

7599,tt0887971,1208,6,The only really good part is the last 10 seconds.

7630,tt0887971,1210,3,"Message to the victim: When the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing, take that opportunity to ""RUN AWAY"", don't sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear."
7631,tt0887971,1210,4,"Message to the Director: if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot, you can't have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away!"
7632,tt0887971,1210,5,time and motion doesn't work that way.
7633,tt0887971,1210,6,It would also be nice to think that a woman doesn't have to brutally kill 4 men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home.
7634,tt0887971,1211,1,The only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes.
7635,tt0887971,1211,2,Other than that this movie is a big DUD.
7636,tt0887971,1211,3,"We have Kim Basinger, the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first 30 min. of the movie, which added nothing."
7637,tt0887971,1211,4,Then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks who took up 2 parking spaces on this busy xmas eve.
7638,tt0887971,1211,5,They begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her.
7639,tt0887971,1211,6,"From there this movie gets worse, way worse."
7640,tt0887971,1211,7,I know its only a movie and you've gotta go with the flow but she's got about a 5 min. headstart and she can't hide or find someone to help her.
7641,tt0887971,1211,8,Instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest.
7642,tt0887971,1211,9,In typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her.
7643,tt0887971,1211,10,But now she turns into one tough mofu.
7644,tt0887971,1211,11,You get the point.
7645,tt0887971,1211,12,Do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type.
7646,tt0887971,1211,13,It's so illogical you'll be questioning every scene.
7647,tt0887971,1211,14,"It is embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the cast, as well as the consumers."
7648,tt0887971,1212,1,"Overall this movie is dreadful, and should have never been made."
7649,tt0887971,1212,2,"One of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters, for example, if she is about to be attacked, you want to feel, ""Oh My God, No!"", but you don't in this case, you don't care because there is no link that has been made to know the character."
7650,tt0887971,1212,3,"In the trailer, it seemed as though the movie would be great, yet there is no suspense what so ever really."
7651,tt0887971,1212,4,There could have been maybe some mystery but there is not.
7652,tt0887971,1212,5,"""All she has is a toolbox."" was said on the DVD's back, you would think that it was carefully planned this movie, and cleverly made, but it is not, The ending, was just awful, very straight forward, and pointless too."
7653,tt0887971,1212,6,"The acting is either average or below average, maybe even lower."
7654,tt0887971,1212,7,In my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life.
7655,tt0887971,1212,8,"The ""Special Effects"" and sets were average too, nothing special what so ever."
7656,tt0887971,1212,9,"There is not much gore, or bloody violence, not much blood is shown."
7657,tt0887971,1212,10,"This movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing, yet really, its not even worth looking for, I do not recommend this to anyone, unless they are easily satisfied, by a few fights and a boring story."
7658,tt0887971,1213,1,I can't believe the likes of Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger got involved ins this piece of garbage!
7659,tt0887971,1213,2,The script is so poorly written and the directing so weak both by the same person that its hard to find more one dimension characters in a film.
7660,tt0887971,1213,3,The dialogs are so lame that this so called thriller got laughs out of the few fools that got into the theatre.
7661,tt0887971,1213,4,"The setup it's tricky, inviting you to believe you are going to watch a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out into the most stupid persecution film."
7662,tt0887971,1213,5,"Bassinger's character is so dumb, that she actually stops to scream to God ""Where are you!"""
7663,tt0887971,1213,6,"so the people after her can follow, and then takes a leak!!!!"
7664,tt0887971,1213,7,"And then she apparently got into the smallest wood in the world, I mean, she runs all over the place and the killers never loose track of her, and this happens in the middle of the night."
7665,tt0887971,1213,8,"It really makes me wonder, is that really the best writing people in Hollywood can find that they spend millions producing it."
7666,tt0887971,1214,1,A friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his that had been optioned by a movie studio.
7667,tt0887971,1214,2,To say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts I'd ever read would be a bold understatement.
7668,tt0887971,1214,3,Yet I never told him this.
7669,tt0887971,1214,4,Why.
7670,tt0887971,1214,5,"Because in a world where films like ""While She Was Out"" can be green lighted and attract an Oscar winning star like Kim Basinger, a screenplay lacking in character, content and common sense is no guarantee that it won't sell."
7671,tt0887971,1214,6,"As so many other reviewers have pointed out, ""While She Was Out"" is a dreadfully under written Woman in Peril film that has abused housewife Basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on Christmas Eve."
7672,tt0887971,1214,7,"Every gripe is legitimate, from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw dropping lapses of logic, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise."
7673,tt0887971,1214,8,"Here are a couple of things that struck me:1 I don't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk, the house IS a mess with toys."
7674,tt0887971,1214,9,"Since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves.2 Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on screen.3 Sure the film is stupid."
7675,tt0887971,1214,10,"But so are the countless ""thrillers"" I've sat through where the women are portrayed as wailing, helpless victims of male sadism."
7676,tt0887971,1214,11,"Stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her tormentors.4 I LOVED the ending!"
7677,tt0887971,1214,12,"5 Though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase, I really DO think this film should be retitled ""The Red Toolbox of Doom."""
7678,tt0887971,1215,1,"I don't often give one star reviews, but the computer won't let me do negative numbers."
7679,tt0887971,1215,2,The opening titles tell us we're in deep water already.
7680,tt0887971,1215,3,"Although this is a low budget exploitation film, there are 17 producers credited."
7681,tt0887971,1215,4,No.
7682,tt0887971,1215,5,No.
7683,tt0887971,1215,6,At the beginning of the story abusive husband Kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community.
7684,tt0887971,1215,7,The house is a pigsty.
7685,tt0887971,1215,8,"His wife, Della Kim Basinger has let the children run amok all day."
7686,tt0887971,1215,9,OK.
7687,tt0887971,1215,10,We're already in deep water.
7688,tt0887971,1215,11,Ms.
7689,tt0887971,1215,12,Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out.
7690,tt0887971,1215,13,"Uh, are these her children or grandchildren."
7691,tt0887971,1215,14,It's Christmas Eve.
7692,tt0887971,1215,15,"Della drives to the mall, a lengthy scene that could have been cut."
7693,tt0887971,1215,16,To bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on Christmas Eve.
7694,tt0887971,1215,17,Sure.
7695,tt0887971,1215,18,For a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it.
7696,tt0887971,1215,19,"We get some actual suspense in the driving scenes, though."
7697,tt0887971,1215,20,It's raining and traffic is bad.
7698,tt0887971,1215,21,First we see Della try to drive and smoke at the same time.
7699,tt0887971,1215,22,"Then later Della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time, at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone."
7700,tt0887971,1215,23,"She wanders the mall, sees an old friend from college, tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined gosh, maybe her husband is grumpy because he's going broke, but that's too complicated for the script to follow."
7701,tt0887971,1215,24,In the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films.
7702,tt0887971,1215,25,"One White boy Lukas Hass watching his career go down the toilet, one Black, one Asian, and one Hispanic."
7703,tt0887971,1215,26,Imagine a company of Up with People gone to the bad and you'll have the idea.
7704,tt0887971,1215,27,Although they have a gun she gives them attitude.
7705,tt0887971,1215,28,"A mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head, firing more than once."
7706,tt0887971,1215,29,"The parking lot is crowded as can be, people everywhere, and nobody notices."
7707,tt0887971,1215,30,"Della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area, she drives to a construction site, where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools literally at hand."
7708,tt0887971,1215,31,MAJOR spoiler ahead.
7709,tt0887971,1215,32,She drives back home.
7710,tt0887971,1215,33,The car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain.
7711,tt0887971,1215,34,"Checks on the children, goes downstairs, and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range."
7712,tt0887971,1215,35,The experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for Della.
7713,tt0887971,1215,36,"Instead we know that her children will probably spend Christmas in foster care or a group home, because the State will collect them while she answers to murder one charges."
7714,tt0887971,1215,37,The four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense.
7715,tt0887971,1215,38,"The husband, different story."
7716,tt0887971,1215,39,I'm so glad I saw this on cable.
7717,tt0887971,1215,40,If I'd seen it in a theater did it get any release.
7718,tt0887971,1215,41,I'd have been furious.
7719,tt0887971,1215,42,"As is, I'm just sad seeing talents like Ms."
7720,tt0887971,1215,43,Basinger and Mr.
7721,tt0887971,1215,44,Haas waste themselves on garbage like this.
7722,tt0887971,1215,45,"One very good thing, though."
7723,tt0887971,1215,46,This was written and directed by Susan Montford.
7724,tt0887971,1215,47,Ms.
7725,tt0887971,1215,48,Montford has not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd.
7726,tt0887971,1215,49,There is justice in the world.
7727,tt0887971,1216,1,The genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one.
7728,tt0887971,1216,2,The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY.
7729,tt0887971,1216,3,"I realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next, but this movie was so predictable, and is just not believable."
7730,tt0887971,1216,4,"I find that the more I watch this kind of movie, the more I am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger."
7731,tt0887971,1216,5,Continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid.
7732,tt0887971,1216,6,"If they took the time to make it more realistic, I might have enjoyed it a little."
7733,tt0887971,1216,7,"Having said that, you might be better off staying away from this one."
7734,tt0887971,1217,1,Its Christmas Eve and lazy and submissive housewife Della Kim Basinger receives some violent threats from her troubled and abusive husband.
7735,tt0887971,1217,2,Leaving her twin children in bed she ventures off into the night for one last shopping spree at the local mall.
7736,tt0887971,1217,3,"Its busy there and finding a parking space is nigh on impossible, Della takes umbrage at one motorist who parks in two spaces, she leaves them a note saying as much."
7737,tt0887971,1217,4,"Returning to her car after visiting the shops she is confronted by some yobs, Yup the owners of the car she left a note on, they are very angry and want some fun with her, a kindly security guard steps into assist her, but things get out of hand and the guard is shot, Della flees with the now murderous yobs in hot pursuit, they shoot at her, she looses control of her car and crashes, quickly grabbing her toolbox from the trunk, she hides in a deserted building site, but is soon caught, just before they try to rape and kill her, from her magical toolbox she produces a wrench, wounding their leader ""Chuckie"", she manages to escape again into the nearby woods, in the fracas one of the gang is killed, it just happens to be the black guy Here the night gets worse for all involved as a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues."
7738,tt0887971,1217,5,"A similar plot line to Eden Lake drew me to this, but that is where the comparisons end."
7739,tt0887971,1217,6,"This is a brainless and dumb film, shockingly scripted and horribly acted by all involved, the doe eyed Disney esquire twin kids are horrible to watch, but its Lukas Haas as Chuckie, that must take the plaudits in the bad acting department, although he is given a run for his money by the equally awful husband."
7740,tt0887971,1217,7,"As a film its plot line is completely telegraphed all the way through, even in the set up early on Della's cell phone goes dead and then in the shops her credit card has been cancelled by her hubby and she has no cash and its Christmas Eve, now where could they be going with this I wonder..."
7741,tt0887971,1217,8,"The only surprising part of this $hit is when after killing all the clich√©d bad guys with the contents of her magic toolbox, she demands Chuckie to f@ck her, if my jaw had not already been on the floor at this films awfulness, it would surely have dropped and smashed on the floor. even the ending is messed up, all the feminist grannies wanting their pound of flesh are left utterly disappointed.."
7742,tt0887971,1217,9,"I didn't think I could be further disappointed, but then I saw that Guillermo del Toro produced this dreck"
7743,tt0887971,1218,1,So this is what actress Kim Basinger has succumbed to.
7744,tt0887971,1218,2,"Mmm¬Ö to tell the truth the film's title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic, but simplicity can have its strengths."
7745,tt0887971,1218,3,Anyhow by the end of 'While She Was Out' I was left feeling rather indifferent.
7746,tt0887971,1218,4,"Not the worse despite being engulfed by negatives, but there's easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm, but compact and unbalanced late night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid, when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park."
7747,tt0887971,1218,5,"The problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material taken from a short story, along with the very variable performances."
7748,tt0887971,1218,6,"The flimsy script was poorly thought out which isn't so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off, so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events."
7749,tt0887971,1218,7,"As for the bunch of stereotypical goons led by an unconvincing Lukas Hass as a loose canon terrorizing Basinger, well they were less than threatening, but hopelessly clueless."
7750,tt0887971,1218,8,Watching Basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand don't ask me why. knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didn't elicit tension or emotion¬Ö but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up.
7751,tt0887971,1218,9,"Basinger's performance is stout like, but doesn't craft much empathy."
7752,tt0887971,1218,10,Craig Sheffer shows up as her hot headed husband.
7753,tt0887971,1218,11,Strangely I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen¬Ö thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic why would she be constantly carrying it and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug¬Ö her choices were quite disappointing.
7754,tt0887971,1218,12,"Watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty, due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead."
7755,tt0887971,1218,13,"Susan Montford's soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy, as it pretty much chugs along."
7756,tt0887971,1218,14,"I liked the opening credits though, with its hauntingly sullen score which is the most effective thing throughout the feature and polished photography."
7757,tt0887971,1218,15,No great shakes.
7758,tt0887971,1218,16,"Doesn't ask much of your time, but I wouldn't care to see it again."
7759,tt0887971,1218,17,"However with the inclusion of a Joy Division song, it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen."
7760,tt0887971,1219,1,"First of all, really Kim Basinger."
7761,tt0887971,1219,2,"Your rich banker husband leaves you alone in your beautiful, most likely paid in cash for home, and you can't even put on a decent shirt."
7762,tt0887971,1219,3,"I'm a woman, and yes, I'm going to come right out say it clean something, starting with your hair."
7763,tt0887971,1219,4,"And while you're at it, it's Christmas Eve."
7764,tt0887971,1219,5,Buy your kids some presents...or at least a Christmas tree.
7765,tt0887971,1219,6,"Don't drive 40 minutes to the crowded mall, park your car 3 miles away and cry about it the whole walk in, and simply buy wrapping paper."
7766,tt0887971,1219,7,"Also, the next time you decide to leave someone a nasty note, don't sign your name."
7767,tt0887971,1219,8,I refuse to feel sorry for Della.
7768,tt0887971,1219,9,"Obviously, due to the fact that Kim Basinger is this masterpiece's executive producer, she wants you to feel bad for the poor white blond woman."
7769,tt0887971,1219,10,We get it.
7770,tt0887971,1219,11,"Alec Baldwin is a jerk, but seriously, don't model horrible films after your own life."
7771,tt0887971,1219,12,"Also, you're in you 50s."
7772,tt0887971,1219,13,You definitely wouldn't have 8 year old twins.
7773,tt0887971,1219,14,AND THOSE NAMES.
7774,tt0887971,1219,15,Terry and Tammy.
7775,tt0887971,1219,16,Way to let your kids grow up with any decent chance of ever respecting themselves.
7776,tt0887971,1219,17,"It's also pretty fantastic to hear the characters in the film constantly call her beautiful or refer to her as a ""girl""...obviously Ms."
7777,tt0887971,1219,18,Basinger had some say about what goes in the script.
7778,tt0887971,1219,19,It's also pretty awesome how none of the criminals can fight back.
7779,tt0887971,1219,20,"Apparently, Della's magical ninja skills are impossible to beat."
7780,tt0887971,1219,21,Her driving skills are pretty nifty too.
7781,tt0887971,1219,22,"This film is so clich√©, it hurts."
7782,tt0887971,1219,23,Wahhhhh!
7783,tt0887971,1219,24,They spelled your name wrong on the tea cup.
7784,tt0887971,1219,25,Or your husband put a hole in the wall but all you can think about is buying nail polish when you're at the mall instead of maybe some plaster and paint.
7785,tt0887971,1219,26,Or the woman you went to high school with bought the teddy you were looking at.
7786,tt0887971,1219,27,Boohooo!
7787,tt0887971,1219,28,The fact that she refuses to take off that BRIGHT trench coat while running through the woods screaming and breaking everything in her path proves my point this woman is a moron.
7788,tt0887971,1219,29,"Who thinks to grab the toolbox out of the car, but not their purse, full of identifying artifacts such as your ADDRESS."
7789,tt0887971,1219,30,"I have never wanted the ""bad guys"" to succeed as much as when I watched this film."
7790,tt0887971,1219,31,"And did anyone else happen to catch the ""African American"" shirt the black guy was sporting."
7791,tt0887971,1219,32,"Oh yes, rewind and feast your eyes on perhaps the most racially stereotypical prop in a film yet."
7792,tt0887971,1219,33,Don't waste and hour and twenty minutes of your life.
7793,tt0887971,1219,34,"Instead, go do what Della couldn't figure out how to do...take care of your kids, and maybe brush your hair."
7794,tt0887971,1219,35,That powerful ballad at the end though was pretty impressive.
7795,tt0887971,1219,36,"Singing ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" in the rain while your bloody arm clings oh so tightly to your wrapping paper is about as emotional as it gets."
7796,tt0887971,1219,37,Thanks Della!
7797,tt0887971,1220,1,"She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this film shows why she also is a perennial Razzie nominee."
7798,tt0887971,1220,2,To do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money.
7799,tt0887971,1220,3,"She could do ads on why you shouldn't talk on a cell phone while driving, especially at night on the way to a crowded mall."
7800,tt0887971,1220,4,Susan Montford should stick to producing Shoot 'Em Up as she is not very good as a writer/director.
7801,tt0887971,1220,5,"She is accosted by four thugs in the mall parking lot, and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun."
7802,tt0887971,1220,6,What does she do.
7803,tt0887971,1220,7,She starts pushing and cursing them like she knows martial arts or something.
7804,tt0887971,1220,8,"She manages to get away, but gets lost in the forest after crashing."
7805,tt0887971,1220,9,Why didn't she run to someones house.
7806,tt0887971,1220,10,We get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox.
7807,tt0887971,1220,11,"Of course, their guns are no match for her wrench."
7808,tt0887971,1220,12,Ha!
7809,tt0887971,1220,13,"Of course, she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver."
7810,tt0887971,1220,14,Those poor thugs.
7811,tt0887971,1220,15,"Now, she's home for Christmas and she brought a gun!"
7812,tt0887971,1221,1,"I remember the days in which Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb Blondie,romantic interest or damsel in danger."
7813,tt0887971,1221,2,"But,everything changed when she won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent movie L.A."
7814,tt0887971,1221,3,"Confidential,and I think I was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance."
7815,tt0887971,1221,4,"However,after that moment,her career did not follow the ideal path."
7816,tt0887971,1221,5,"Sure,the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies like People I Know or The Door in the Floor,but we have never seen her again on a substantial character."
7817,tt0887971,1221,6,"The movie While She Was Out does nothing to put her on that situation; and it is not only that her character is not too tasty,but also that the movie is really crappy."
7818,tt0887971,1221,7,The screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic.
7819,tt0887971,1221,8,"However,Basinger brings some conviction to her character,and that makes this poor movie to win a few points."
7820,tt0887971,1221,9,This movie is full of clich√©s and generic villains.
7821,tt0887971,1221,10,"The work of director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly,because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone."
7822,tt0887971,1221,11,The ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous.
7823,tt0887971,1221,12,I do not recommend While She Was Out at all.
7824,tt0887971,1221,13,This film commits the capital sin of being boring.
7825,tt0887971,1222,1,This is one seriously disturbed movie.
7826,tt0887971,1222,2,"Even Though the boys deserved some of what they got.....the sadistic gruesome executions were ""slightly"" over the top."
7827,tt0887971,1222,3,The only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot.
7828,tt0887971,1222,4,"At the beginning of the movie, there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair, but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security, before the joy of what was to come."
7829,tt0887971,1222,5,"The only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if Jack Nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled, ""and, where is the batman.""."
7830,tt0887971,1222,6,Kim Basinger could have screamed.
7831,tt0887971,1222,7,Now that would have been cool!
7832,tt0887971,1223,1,What a weekend.
7833,tt0887971,1223,2,"Two days ago I watched the first half of ""War Games 2: Dead Code"", now ""While she was out""."
7834,tt0887971,1223,3,I am trying to come to a decision which one was worse in terms of pain in my mind while watching.
7835,tt0887971,1223,4,"I guess, ""While she was out"" was worse."
7836,tt0887971,1223,5,"It has all been said before in other comments: Unrealistic, illogical etc. the only thing I really have to add is that at some point I started feeling more for the evil guys than for the woman because I would have recommended her for a Darwin award if she actually died only watched first half, so I don't know."
7837,tt0887971,1223,6,Soon I was at two Darwin awards if that's even possible for her immense stupidity.
7838,tt0887971,1223,7,"And, hey: Produced by Kim Basinger."
7839,tt0887971,1223,8,"So she did not only know the script but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us, the people."
7840,tt0887971,1223,9,"I consider humans who waste considerable amounts of money to be evil because the money could have used to feed and clothe quite a few people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent, which are idiots, a good opportunity to show just how much of an idiot they are."
7841,tt0887971,1224,1,Who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie.
7842,tt0887971,1224,2,Accidental killing of a security guard... characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them... and better...
7843,tt0887971,1224,3,A red toolbox of death.
7844,tt0887971,1224,4,Please....
7845,tt0887971,1224,5,Hypothermic weak thugs...
7846,tt0887971,1224,6,Acting from hell...
7847,tt0887971,1224,7,"Stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy, thriller, voyeurism and... female ... uhm Rambo."
7848,tt0887971,1224,8,Unbelievable and it's an insult to any thinking person.
7849,tt0887971,1224,9,"Do not watch, walk away it's more horrible than you may imagine..."
7850,tt0887971,1224,10,And on top of it all it's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence...
7851,tt0887971,1224,11,"Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny, this is just pathetic and terrible."
7852,tt0887971,1224,12,Good luck next time. :
7853,tt0887971,1225,1,"Well, let me start off by saying how utterly HILARIOUS this film is, I simply couldn't keep myself from laughing at the sheer stupidity of it."
7854,tt0887971,1225,2,"Don't get me wrong, it IS well acted particularly by Bassinger but the script is just, well the mind boggles truly."
7855,tt0887971,1225,3,The premise is good and up until Della actually witnesses the murder it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill .
7856,tt0887971,1225,4,"Half way through the film the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and of course instead of lobbing it at the guy's head, she decides to pull out a screwdriver, car jack and finally a flare as in for a sinking ship respectively to kill her victims."
7857,tt0887971,1225,5,"Then there is the final line that I promise, if it doesn't have you in stitches then I will eat my own left foot."
7858,tt0887971,1225,6,"I would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned, appalling film making."
7859,tt0887971,1225,7,"Might I also suggest you watch out for the scene in the scrap yard with the guy falling from the one foot high plank of wood, gets me every time."
7860,tt0887971,1226,1,"My, how the mighty have fallen."
7861,tt0887971,1226,2,Kim Basinger is a great actress but she was definitely slumming when she took this role.
7862,tt0887971,1226,3,This movie is bad for one reason in particular: lapses in logic.
7863,tt0887971,1226,4,Its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it just looks real stupid.
7864,tt0887971,1226,5,This is the worst thriller I've ever seen and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted.
7865,tt0887971,1226,6,The story details DellaKim Basingeris just getting from buying gifts in a mall an is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid.
7866,tt0887971,1226,7,From then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools.
7867,tt0887971,1226,8,So many things are wrong with this movie.
7868,tt0887971,1226,9,"As I said this movie leaps over logic at every turn and with the exception of Kim Basinger, the acting is made for TV bad."
7869,tt0887971,1226,10,"Hell, this pseudo thriller is made for TV bad."
7870,tt0887971,1226,11,"The way she kills each of these politically correct thugs1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African American all coming together to stalk a Caucasian woman."
7871,tt0887971,1226,12,Don't you just love America.is laughable to a fault.
7872,tt0887971,1226,13,The way she killed the Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically.
7873,tt0887971,1226,14,The sex scene with the main hoodlum was so out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame.
7874,tt0887971,1226,15,I only recommend this to lovers of bad films and no one else.
7875,tt0887971,1226,16,Anybody else especially Kim Basinger fans would do well not to own this flick.
7876,tt0887971,1226,17,You don't want see an actress you respect in a film this bad now do you.
7877,tt0887971,1226,18,Of course not.
7878,tt0887971,1226,19,You were warned.
7879,tt0887971,1227,1,"Even though many people here praises this movie, I have to warn you."
7880,tt0887971,1227,2,It has no logic whatsoever.
7881,tt0887971,1227,3,"I think that Basinger does a decent job at acting, but you can't make a thriller if there is a great lack of realism."
7882,tt0887971,1227,4,This scene paints a good picture for you of the movie : while Basinger is pursued by murderous thugs she decides to sit down and gaze upon a picture she finds from her pocket.
7883,tt0887971,1227,5,"The picture is from her daughter and it reads ""we love you mommy""."
7884,tt0887971,1227,6,Who does something like that .
7885,tt0887971,1227,7,What the eff.
7886,tt0887971,1227,8,And believe me when I say that it is not nearly as stupid as some other scenes of the movie.
7887,tt0887971,1227,9,"Someone stated that this is a ""hidden gem""."
7888,tt0887971,1227,10,"Well, I have to strongly disagree, this movie has stayed hidden for a reason."
7889,tt0887971,1227,11,And it's not a gem.
7890,tt0887971,1227,12,"Oh, and please, I don't even want to start commenting about the red toolbox."
7891,tt0887971,1227,13,"It hurts my brain :D Usually the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small amounts, but this movie basically is made possible only because of the lack of logic."
7892,tt0887971,1227,14,"But, i still give it a 4 because even though it is embarrassingly flawed in logic, it has certain mood that kept me watching till the end."
7893,tt0887971,1227,15,"So if you choose to watch this, you know you have been warned."
7894,tt0887971,1228,1,Wow.
7895,tt0887971,1228,2,"Rarely have I felt the need to comment on movies lately, but this one especially is begging for a beatdown."
7896,tt0887971,1228,3,Let's start at the beginning.
7897,tt0887971,1228,4,"First, writer director Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger in the tired old victim role, complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence."
7898,tt0887971,1228,5,Let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite.
7899,tt0887971,1228,6,Montford's pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the Christmas tree with no star is laughable.
7900,tt0887971,1228,7,"When She Goes Out for some Christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night, Della is furious that somebody double parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year."
7901,tt0887971,1228,8,"She decides to do something about it, so she leaves a nasty note on the car's windshield."
7902,tt0887971,1228,9,The next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to Della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall.
7903,tt0887971,1228,10,"When she finally gets to her car, the thugs confront her about the note, a cop is killed, and she runs, and they catch up to her, and she gets away, and they chase her some more, and on and on."
7904,tt0887971,1228,11,Everything is completely predictable and uninvolving.
7905,tt0887971,1228,12,"The thugs are not scary or menacing at all, and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways."
7906,tt0887971,1228,13,This is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine.
7907,tt0887971,1228,14,Why the bad guys don't just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me.
7908,tt0887971,1228,15,"And once, just once, in a film like this, does the leader of the pack have to die last."
7909,tt0887971,1228,16,What does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept.
7910,tt0887971,1228,17,"Much of the movie simply consists of Lukas Haas running around in the woods screaming ""Della!!!"""
7911,tt0887971,1228,18,And the inclusion of Joy Division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting.
7912,tt0887971,1228,19,"The part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when Della, exhausted and hurt, cries out to the heavens, ""Where are you, God."""
7913,tt0887971,1228,20,"Where, indeed, was god when this movie was being made."
7914,tt0887971,1228,21,"I give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting, and it's not as bad as 'BTK Killer,' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film."
7915,tt0887971,1228,22,Cheers!
7916,tt0887971,1229,1,"Sorry, but aside from Kim Basinger doing a good job acting scared, this was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in awhile."
7917,tt0887971,1229,2,Logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard.
7918,tt0887971,1229,3,Yet no one seems to notice.
7919,tt0887971,1229,4,"Then, instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall, she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit."
7920,tt0887971,1229,5,"I can't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs, carrying a red toolbox, screaming for God to come help her, and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others."
7921,tt0887971,1229,6,"Please trust me, this is bad and a bit tasteless as well."
7922,tt0887971,1230,1,Words can't describe how utterly stupid this story and therefore bad this movie is!
7923,tt0887971,1230,2,"Basinger, Del Toro ... what were you thinking .."
7924,tt0887971,1230,3,So there's a mall and its parking space is totally full.
7925,tt0887971,1230,4,Basinger's character goes in to buy a cup of tea and some packaging paper.
7926,tt0887971,1230,5,"When she comes out, the whole place is so empty, that nobody hears two gunshots fired nearby .."
7927,tt0887971,1230,6,"Even though she lives there, when she drives away from the baddies, she goes to the most remote and godforsaken place possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place .."
7928,tt0887971,1230,7,COME ON !!!
7929,tt0887971,1230,8,"I won't even go into the infamous red toolbox, since other people have done that before."
7930,tt0887971,1230,9,Let alone how she kills the moronic thugs one by one.
7931,tt0887971,1230,10,"This is so stupid, without the least bit of logic, I can only warn you watching it, it's a TOTAL waste of time, honestly !!"
7932,tt0887971,1231,1,Della Myers Kim Basinger is an upper class housewife that lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband Kenneth Craig Sheffer.
7933,tt0887971,1231,2,"Della gives all the attention to the twins, neglecting their house and her appearance and upsetting Kenneth."
7934,tt0887971,1231,3,"On the Christmas Eve, she drives to the local mall in the night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts, and she does not find any parking space available."
7935,tt0887971,1231,4,"When she sees an old car parked on two spots, she leaves a message to the owner calling him ""selfish jerk""."
7936,tt0887971,1231,5,"When the mall closes, Della's car is hold by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks ¬ñ Chuckie Lukas Haas, the Afro American Huey Jamie Starr, the Chinese American Vingh Leonard Wu and the Latin Tom√°s Luis Ch√°vez."
7937,tt0887971,1231,6,"When the security guard of the mall protects her, he is shot on the head by Chuckie, Della speeds up her car trying to escape from the criminals."
7938,tt0887971,1231,7,However she crashes her truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang.
7939,tt0887971,1231,8,"She takes the toolbox and hides in the wood, fighting against the gang to survive."
7940,tt0887971,1231,9,"A couple of days ago, I saw the trailer of ""While She Was Out"" and I was anxious to watch the DVD."
7941,tt0887971,1231,10,"Unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie, and I am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clich√©s."
7942,tt0887971,1231,11,Della Myers is presented as an insecure and neglectful housewife and inexistent as wife; the motherhood is her only interest in her concept of family.
7943,tt0887971,1231,12,She is chased by four mean criminals but she defeats them with a toolbox that seems to be the Batman's utility belt.
7944,tt0887971,1231,13,"Therefore, the plot is so absurd that irritates."
7945,tt0887971,1231,14,"The gang of criminals is formed by the favorite clich√© of American movies, with an Afro American, a Chinese American and a Latin together with an American lord to be politically correct."
7946,tt0887971,1231,15,"Kim Basinger has a decent acting, but their children are too young for a fifty five year old woman."
7947,tt0887971,1231,16,My vote is four.
7948,tt0887971,1231,17,"Title Brazil: ""Enquanto Ela Est√° Fora"" ""While She Was Out"""
7949,tt0887971,1232,1,"It says that a girl named Susan Montford both wrote and directed this ""movie."""
7950,tt0887971,1232,2,No wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing.
7951,tt0887971,1232,3,She made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career.
7952,tt0887971,1232,4,This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium.
7953,tt0887971,1232,5,"The fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs, is the blatant and complete lack of LOGIC.After she leaves the mall, she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her."
7954,tt0887971,1232,6,"Tell me, what woman would aggressively SHOVE a potential attacker while being surrounded, and insult them verbally."
7955,tt0887971,1232,7,"I don't mean after an attack had already started, because then of course it's completely normal for someone to fight back."
7956,tt0887971,1232,8,But she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level.
7957,tt0887971,1232,9,"No woman would do that unless she 1 had a weapon, 2 has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close, and so is relatively safe from harm, or 3 the attackers are so young, and weak looking that she's pretty sure she can take them."
7958,tt0887971,1232,10,"None of that applied in this situation, so she was just acting like someone that's asking to get raped or mugged."
7959,tt0887971,1232,11,"And by the way, when the security guard approached, as SOON as he came within viewing distance of Kim Basinger, why wouldn't she immediately either run towards him for help, or scream.."
7960,tt0887971,1232,12,"When she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head, she drives into a deserted part of town, and crashes."
7961,tt0887971,1232,13,"She had a good three minute lead on the pursuers, instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing, she gets out her Red Toolbox and starts messing around under her hood."
7962,tt0887971,1232,14,"I understand she was trying to fix her car, but she should've ran."
7963,tt0887971,1232,15,"I didn't even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie, because I loathe people who do that in their reviews, but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that I have to comment on it."
7964,tt0887971,1232,16,"Why would she carry a loud, Red Toolbox as she's trying to sneak away in the dark."
7965,tt0887971,1232,17,"When she does get caught, one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox."
7966,tt0887971,1232,18,"First she resists, then eventually opens it."
7967,tt0887971,1232,19,And takes out a wrench.
7968,tt0887971,1232,20,"This scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect I have to break it down, it's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie."
7969,tt0887971,1232,21,"When asked to open the box, she's resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didn't open it, in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touch/push/open/manipulate, and once that hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs that device, only to have that device automatically dispense a chemical/shoot him in the face/render him unconscious, which was the hero's plan all along."
7970,tt0887971,1232,22,"It feels like that's what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here, as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a WRENCH and dispatches one of the thugs, and somehow GETS AWAY from him and the three other thugs."
7971,tt0887971,1232,23,"Throughout the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this suburban house wife, sneaking around the woods as she carries her Red Toolbox, taking out various tools used as weapons to KILL HER ATTACKERS.When she was running away, how did she end up moving BACK to where the thugs were."
7972,tt0887971,1232,24,I think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude.
7973,tt0887971,1232,25,She somehow crept up on them when I thought she was moving AWAY from them.
7974,tt0887971,1232,26,"Finally, this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she's being chased in the first place is because from the thugs' perspective, she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier, and so they felt they had to kill her."
7975,tt0887971,1232,27,How ridiculous.
7976,tt0887971,1232,28,"As one of the thugs even said, they could've just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from, no one but her had seen them anyway, and she probably didn't get the license plate."
7977,tt0887971,1232,29,"Even if these possibilities wouldn't work in their favor, how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder."
7978,tt0887971,1233,1,"Oh my god. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old. the plot, the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace."
7979,tt0887971,1233,2,"I am not usually this critical about any movie, cause every person has his/her style."
7980,tt0887971,1233,3,"But this movie, however, was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008."
7981,tt0887971,1233,4,"I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown, and i think it should stay like this, for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke."
7982,tt0887971,1233,5,"I advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies, or even simply movies to stay far away from this one."
7983,tt0995752,10019,1,Kareena Kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm.
7984,tt0995752,10019,2,Akshay Kumar...
7985,tt0995752,10019,3,Anil Kapoor....
7986,tt0995752,10019,4,Maybe Saif....
7987,tt0995752,10019,5,Kareena Kapoor in a bikini.....
7988,tt0995752,10019,6,Good Banner..
7989,tt0995752,10019,7,Kareena Kapoor in a bikini.....
7990,tt0995752,10019,8,Not one good reason not to see this movie....
7991,tt0995752,10019,9,Or so i thought ........
7992,tt0995752,10019,10,Didnt these people make JBJ...
7993,tt0995752,10019,11,Why o Why did i forget that.
7994,tt0995752,10019,12,For all the criticism the first half of the movie isn't that bad...
7995,tt0995752,10019,13,There is some intrigue and YOU FEEL A SORT OF IRRITATION MIXED WITH EXCITEMENT THAT I FELT WHEN SEEING GUY RITCHIE MOVIES LIKE LOCK STOCK AND SNATCH.Kareena Kapoor is sizzling in a very skinny model sort of way.
7996,tt0995752,10019,14,Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar as only he can be.
7997,tt0995752,10019,15,"Anil Kapoor is annoying but kind of funny, YOU ALMOST FORGET THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND HIM.Saif is sidey ala Main Khiladi.. once again."
7998,tt0995752,10019,16,"There is the occasional laugh and a few chuckles, and a few goosebumps during the kareena saif love story kareena in the rain, behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm."
7999,tt0995752,10019,17,BUT MOSTLY THIS HALF PROMISES MORE THAN IT DELIVERS.....
8000,tt0995752,10019,18,WHICH MAKES THE SECOND HALF ALL THE MORE UNBEARABLE....
8001,tt0995752,10019,19,There was almost a cheer when the interval came not only because because of the wet kareena because of what people thought were the things to come.
8002,tt0995752,10019,20,INSTEAD WE WERE TREATED TO MIND NUMBING TORTURE WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO PUT IN WORDS.Saif suddenly seam like a comic sidekick...
8003,tt0995752,10019,21,"SUDDENLY THE SEXY KAREENA LOOKS ANOREXIC, YOU REALISE THAT THE SECOND LAST FLOOR IS NOW EMPTY AND HER FACE LOOKS TO BIG FOR HER BODY only girls can notice this and make other guys notice the second last floor was my observation."
8004,tt0995752,10019,22,ANIL KAPOOR AND HIS SIDEKICKS GET ON YOUR NERVES.Akshay Kumar is the only one who carries off the madness to some extent but even he become intolerable after a while.
8005,tt0995752,10019,23,ALL THE WHILE YOU ARE SUBJECTED TO ONE ABSURDITY AFTER THE OTHER.WHY..!!
8006,tt0995752,10019,24,WHAT..!!!
8007,tt0995752,10019,25,WHEN.!!!
8008,tt0995752,10019,26,WHERE.!!!
8009,tt0995752,10019,27,WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS...
8010,tt0995752,10019,28,"A collective gasp went trough the audience before every song in the second half, which were ordinary even without the movie around it."
8011,tt0995752,10019,29,Cannot relieve the trauma anymore....
8012,tt0995752,10019,30,"CONCLUSION.THIS MOVIE STARTS OF AS A BUZZ WHICH YOU FEEL COULD EVEN TURN OUT TO A HIGH BUT ENDS UP SLOWLY MOVING TOWARDS A HEADACHE AND THEN RAPIDLY TURNS INTO A FULL BLOWN MIGRAINE ATTACK.Please don't watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest.+s Cast, Akshay Kumar, first half.+/ s what, when, how, who to much confusion.need a book to fill this.+s cast, the whole second half need many pages to fill this.total 3/10 im trying to avoid the 1s and 2s too not seem to extreme but make no mistake this movie is unwatchable no matter how decent the first half is."
8013,tt0995752,10020,1,"Vijay Krishna Acharya's 'Tashan' is a over hyped, stylized, product."
8014,tt0995752,10020,2,"Sure its a one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this one."
8015,tt0995752,10020,3,Why.
8016,tt0995752,10020,4,The films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby.
8017,tt0995752,10020,5,"Script is king, without a good script even the greatest director of all time cannot do anything."
8018,tt0995752,10020,6,Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars appearing in it.
8019,tt0995752,10020,7,But nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland.
8020,tt0995752,10020,8,Thumbs down!
8021,tt0995752,10020,9,"Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor."
8022,tt0995752,10020,10,But how could he okay a role like this.
8023,tt0995752,10020,11,"Akshay Kumar is great actor, in fact he's the sole saving grace."
8024,tt0995752,10020,12,Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot.
8025,tt0995752,10020,13,"She looks stunning and leaves you, all stand up."
8026,tt0995752,10020,14,Saif Ali Khan doesn't get his due in here.
8027,tt0995752,10020,15,"Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted.'"
8028,tt0995752,10020,16,Tashan' is a boring film.
8029,tt0995752,10020,17,"The films failure at the box office, should you keep away."
8030,tt0995752,10021,1,The worst movie I have seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya.
8031,tt0995752,10021,2,"There is no story, no humor, no nothing!"
8032,tt0995752,10021,3,The action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard Akshay Kumar Thumbs Up advertisements stitched together.
8033,tt0995752,10021,4,Heavily influenced from The Matrix and Kung Fu Hustle but very poorly executed.
8034,tt0995752,10021,5,"I did not go a lot of expectations, but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder ""What were these guys thinking..!!""."
8035,tt0995752,10021,6,The only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini.
8036,tt0995752,10021,7,"The reason why I did not give a rating of '1' is that every time I think I have seen the worst, Bollywood proves me wrong."
8037,tt0995752,10022,1,"Summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what's the hottest movie of the week, given 99.9% of the screens dedicated to screening it."
8038,tt0995752,10022,2,"OK, so I may exaggerate on the percentage, but you get my drift."
8039,tt0995752,10022,3,"Besides stuff from Hollywood, Bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters, and from some of the trailers shown, I'm hyped to watch them too."
8040,tt0995752,10022,4,"Tashan was billed as one of THE most highly anticipated for 2008, but I was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas."
8041,tt0995752,10022,5,"When I watched Jodha Akbar, it was a full house, but it wasn't for Tashan."
8042,tt0995752,10022,6,"After watching it, I knew why."
8043,tt0995752,10022,7,"It was entertaining, but it was fundamentally weak."
8044,tt0995752,10022,8,"Just like it's literal English title, which means ""Style"", Tashan is all style, but little substance."
8045,tt0995752,10022,9,"Not that it doesn't have the usual star power, but scenes felt forced, and some bordered on a tad ridiculous, even for Bollywood standards I must say."
8046,tt0995752,10022,10,"Which is quite surprising given that Tashan is directed and written by Vijay Krishna Acharya, who wrote Dhoom and Dhoom 2, both of which I enjoyed tremendously."
8047,tt0995752,10022,11,"In his rookie directorial outing with Tashan, while you can't fault his direction, you'd probably scratch your head over the plot, which was clunky at best."
8048,tt0995752,10022,12,"It tried to force too many things into the story, though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation, but that came a little too late, and only toward the finale, which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a Thai action movie, with Hong Kong's wirework and Hollywood's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil."
8049,tt0995752,10022,13,"And in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink, you have an assortment of vehicles appearing, and the one that took the cake, in a Dhoom 2 homage, was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere."
8050,tt0995752,10022,14,"At best, Tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy, and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters."
8051,tt0995752,10022,15,"Saif Ali Khan plays Jimmy Cliff, a call center executive who gives English tuition, only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material."
8052,tt0995752,10022,16,"His playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with Pooja Singh Kareena Kapoor, who's not exactly who she seems, the meek and sweet natured hottie."
8053,tt0995752,10022,17,"She engages Jimmy's services for her boss, mobster Bhaiyyaji Anil Kapoor, who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken English and phrases must like how an ah beng does it."
8054,tt0995752,10022,18,"And to complete the quartet, Akshay Kumar plays Bachchan Pandey, an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by Bhaiyyaji to hunt down Jimmy and Pooja when they escape with money stolen from Bahiyyaji's business."
8055,tt0995752,10022,19,"So begins a road trip of sorts, with friends who turned enemies, and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on."
8056,tt0995752,10022,20,"Jimmy Cliff is probably the most implausible of all, because he goes from zero to hero, executing moves that would shame Rambo, in absolutely no time, which is quite out of character."
8057,tt0995752,10022,21,"Kareena Kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men, and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes, and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee."
8058,tt0995752,10022,22,"Every character has a backstory created, and I thought Akshay Kumar's Bachchan Pandey was probably the best, the most touching and the most fun of the lot, even though his character seemed a lot like a non green Incredible Hulk with his gravity defying leaps and power packing punches."
8059,tt0995752,10022,23,"His wounds also heal automatically, which impressively puts Wolverine to shame."
8060,tt0995752,10022,24,"And the best part is his theme song, which is damn alpha male and played in ra ra mode each time he takes on adversaries."
8061,tt0995752,10022,25,"But sad to say, that's the only tune that is memorable, something that cheers ""Bachchan Pandey Bachchan Pandey""."
8062,tt0995752,10022,26,"For most Bollywood movies I watch, I will usually be able to, despite the obvious language gaps, emerge from screenings humming a tune or two."
8063,tt0995752,10022,27,"I wasn't able to do that after Tashan, because the songs unfortunately just weren't catchy at all."
8064,tt0995752,10022,28,Usually the song/dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location.
8065,tt0995752,10022,29,"That I enjoy, versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain, or atop jagged rocks on the beach front."
8066,tt0995752,10022,30,"Tashan probably didn't take itself too seriously, but coming from Vijay Krishna Acharya's story, you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous, and for continuity to be a little more careful as well."
8067,tt0995752,10022,31,"Billed as a blockbuster, now I can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one."
8068,tt0995752,10022,32,"Despite Akshay Kumr stealing the show, Tashan could have been better on the whole."
8069,tt0995752,10023,1,Shame on Yash Raj films and Aditya Chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth You Tube standards.
8070,tt0995752,10023,2,"I was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction, plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene I just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can ""THROW AWAY"" crores on such stupidity."
8071,tt0995752,10023,3,Shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to.
8072,tt0995752,10023,4,Saif Ali Khan completely disappointed in your choice of film.
8073,tt0995752,10023,5,Kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and Akshay comes up as the dim wit.
8074,tt0995752,10023,6,Anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for English.
8075,tt0995752,10023,7,"His cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes, it was enough to pop a blood vessel."
8076,tt0995752,10023,8,"DON'T WASTe any brain cells, energy or your money to go see this Go SEE / Rent AMU with Konkana Sensharma instead a beautiful piece of independent film thats ever come out of India."
8077,tt0995752,10023,9,"Intelligent, poignant and a wonderful story tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in Indian cinema making."
8078,tt0995752,10024,1,First lesson that some film makers particularly those inspired by Hollywood need to know just 'style' does not sell.
8079,tt0995752,10024,2,I guess Tashan when translated will mean style.
8080,tt0995752,10024,3,"Second, if you are hell bent on selling style, that does not spare you from having a decent story."
8081,tt0995752,10024,4,Tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director.
8082,tt0995752,10024,5,But it is not slick.
8083,tt0995752,10024,6,"For example, all three Saif, Kareena and Akshay are narrators at different points in the story."
8084,tt0995752,10024,7,But this setup is not utilized to properly.
8085,tt0995752,10024,8,There could have been a better mix and match of their narrations.
8086,tt0995752,10024,9,Actions sequences are from the seventies.
8087,tt0995752,10024,10,Cheoreography of the film is awful.
8088,tt0995752,10024,11,I think Vaibhavi Merchant just sleep walked through this film.
8089,tt0995752,10024,12,Vishal Shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film.
8090,tt0995752,10024,13,Why is there a sufi song Dil Haara in Tashan.
8091,tt0995752,10024,14,Why is the cool Hinglish song Dil Dance Maare not on Anil Kapoor when he is the one who is English crazy.
8092,tt0995752,10024,15,Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the film.
8093,tt0995752,10024,16,But he is in his stereotyped self.
8094,tt0995752,10024,17,You won't mind missing this film.
8095,tt0995752,10025,1,If this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of Indian Film Industry Yash Raj then I am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards.
8096,tt0995752,10025,2,"If you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film."
8097,tt0995752,10025,3,The film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar.
8098,tt0995752,10025,4,He has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations.
8099,tt0995752,10025,5,The first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film.
8100,tt0995752,10025,6,That itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision.
8101,tt0995752,10025,7,Every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted.
8102,tt0995752,10025,8,Anil Kapoor's gimmick of attempting good English falls flat most of the times.
8103,tt0995752,10025,9,And Saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie.
8104,tt0995752,10025,10,"In short IT'S THE BIGGEST WASTE OF RESOURSES AFTER ""JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM""."
8105,tt0995752,10025,11,"I would say that even ""Aaja Nachle"" was a better enjoyable movie than this."
8106,tt0995752,10025,12,One cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved.
8107,tt0995752,10025,13,The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshay's love story.
8108,tt0995752,10025,14,After the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music.
8109,tt0995752,10025,15,Vishal Shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song.
8110,tt0995752,10025,16,The songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically.
8111,tt0995752,10025,17,"Only one song ""Falak Tak Chal"" is somehow good of all in the lot."
8112,tt0995752,10025,18,An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar.
8113,tt0995752,10025,19,Regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this : Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign Location probably Ladakh.
8114,tt0995752,10025,20,In the next scene they are searching for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in the dicky of their car.
8115,tt0995752,10025,21,I am still thinking who wrote this.
8116,tt0995752,10025,22,If you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts.
8117,tt0995752,10025,23,You can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are GOD.
8118,tt0995752,10025,24,Are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved.
8119,tt0995752,10025,25,So no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan.
8120,tt0995752,10025,26,"Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, If possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out."
8121,tt0995752,10025,27,"As artists of such stature, you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers."
8122,tt0995752,10025,28,People still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively.
8123,tt0995752,10025,29,"I think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie, the actors and the production house both."
8124,tt0995752,10026,1,"I had some expectation for the movie, since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif."
8125,tt0995752,10026,2,"Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic."
8126,tt0995752,10026,3,"When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way."
8127,tt0995752,10026,4,"Well, the very first scene itself pised me off."
8128,tt0995752,10026,5,"Then, the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences."
8129,tt0995752,10026,6,Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights.
8130,tt0995752,10026,7,It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns!
8131,tt0995752,10026,8,Phew...you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are.
8132,tt0995752,10026,9,The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story.
8133,tt0995752,10026,10,It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies.
8134,tt0995752,10026,11,"Well, the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena, who looked really hot in this one."
8135,tt0995752,10026,12,"And for that, I give a rating of 2 out of 10."
8136,tt0995752,10026,13,"Guys, please..please...don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie."
8137,tt0995752,10026,14,"Well, you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes."
8138,tt0995752,10026,15,Thats all.
8139,tt0995752,10027,1,The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar.
8140,tt0995752,10027,2,"Akshay Kumar possess the superpowers of Leonidus in 300, Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman."
8141,tt0995752,10027,3,It is hilarious.
8142,tt0995752,10027,4,Except for the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy I cannot see anything positive in this film.
8143,tt0995752,10027,5,The story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write.
8144,tt0995752,10027,6,The movie is so unreal that Anil Kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director.
8145,tt0995752,10027,7,Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie there is no other Tashan.
8146,tt0995752,10027,8,I regret wasting my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anybody. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give it a zero.
8147,tt0995752,10028,1,I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a Yashraj Film.
8148,tt0995752,10028,2,"Jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach her boss, Lakhan Singh, English."
8149,tt0995752,10028,3,"The two fall in love and decide to run away but Pooja tells Jimmy that she can't do this as she owes a debt to Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji."
8150,tt0995752,10028,4,But they decide and steal money from him and its only then that Jimmy finds out that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don.
8151,tt0995752,10028,5,"In the meantime, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to track down Jimmy and Pooja."
8152,tt0995752,10028,6,"Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the movie is directed by first time director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra."""
8153,tt0995752,10028,7,"Tashan"" has to be one of the worse films that I have ever watched."
8154,tt0995752,10028,8,Yes!
8155,tt0995752,10028,9,The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor and her much publicised weight loss looks good.
8156,tt0995752,10028,10,But plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other hence why I have said at the beginning that I had expected more from this film as it was a Yashraj Production.
8157,tt0995752,10028,11,"With reference to songs, unfortunately, there is not one song that I can remember now."
8158,tt0995752,10028,12,There are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could have definitely done better while Kareena Kapoor played her part well.
8159,tt0995752,10028,13,But this cannot be said for Anil Kapoor it did not suit him at all as a villain.
8160,tt0995752,10028,14,"Lastly,never mind Aditya Chopra, who in the past has produced and directed good films such as ""Mohabbatein,"" what was Yash Chopra doing by producing such a trash movie."
8161,tt0995752,10028,15,"Conclusion: Bad movie, not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression."
8162,tt0995752,10029,1,I had no idea what the film is about before I saw it because Tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted.
8163,tt0995752,10029,2,"So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that ""It is the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the screenplays for Dhoom 1 & 2 and Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback""."
8164,tt0995752,10029,3,"After watching it, I understood that why their wasn't a proper trailer because there wasn't anything in the film to show."
8165,tt0995752,10029,4,The story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story line.
8166,tt0995752,10029,5,There was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it's difficult to figure out that who is killing who.
8167,tt0995752,10029,6,Also the action was daft & unrealistic e.g. 1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns.
8168,tt0995752,10029,7,While I was watching Tashan it reminded me of 3 films:Sin City: During the opening credits.
8169,tt0995752,10029,8,Koyla: Anil Kapoor's terrible English like Amrish Puri in Koyla.
8170,tt0995752,10029,9,Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny.
8171,tt0995752,10029,10,I also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I don't know where all the money went to.
8172,tt0995752,10029,11,Anyway if you did not like Dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan.
8173,tt0995752,10029,12,Race was hot on heels and that is a million times better.
8174,tt0995752,10029,13,The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs are shot in Greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film.
8175,tt0995752,10029,14,Even Anil Kapoor's terrible English couldn't save this discomfiture.
8176,tt0995752,10030,1,Tashan the title itself explains the nature of the movie.
8177,tt0995752,10030,2,This type of movies are actually made for flop.
8178,tt0995752,10030,3,What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such movies those are worthless than C grade movies.
8179,tt0995752,10030,4,Or even some C grade movies have better and pleasing story than Tashan.
8180,tt0995752,10030,5,The much hyped and over confidently promoted Tashan poorly bombed at the box office which it certainly deserved.
8181,tt0995752,10030,6,"In my view, this is the worst movie ever made from honourable Yash Raj Films' banner."
8182,tt0995752,10030,7,How come they handled such a heavy project to new Vijay Krishna Acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick.
8183,tt0995752,10030,8,He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvi's ways of making like Dhoom but he suffered at last.
8184,tt0995752,10030,9,The action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences.
8185,tt0995752,10030,10,The story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences' hearts.
8186,tt0995752,10030,11,In most scenes Anil Kapoor reminds me of southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions.
8187,tt0995752,10030,12,"I am not a fan of neither Saif nor Akshay, but the award of Kareena should have finally gone to Saif''s hand instead of Akshay."
8188,tt0995752,10030,13,"Just from the starting point I expected of it, but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth."
8189,tt0995752,10030,14,"Saif is the main behind the whole adventure, while Akshay joins in the midst."
8190,tt0995752,10030,15,"In any movie, the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit."
8191,tt0995752,10030,16,"And Tashan loses in this way, and unexpectedly failed to become a hit."
8192,tt0995752,10030,17,Akshay's has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies.
8193,tt0995752,10030,18,He seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again.
8194,tt0995752,10030,19,"In between Saif did a great job in Race, and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie."
8195,tt0995752,10030,20,But he has fully developed himself in the acting field.
8196,tt0995752,10030,21,And last but not the least about Kareena.
8197,tt0995752,10030,22,She looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean.
8198,tt0995752,10030,23,"But I myself don't think so, instead she became slim."
8199,tt0995752,10030,24,Yes slim!!!
8200,tt0995752,10030,25,"it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people or say, male."
8201,tt0995752,10030,26,Beside them it is nice that Saif's son Ibrahim appears in the beginning & last as young Saif.
8202,tt0995752,10030,27,I hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career.
8203,tt0995752,10030,28,"Those who like this Tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood, or say want to be admitted in an asylum."
8204,tt0995752,10030,29,Thumbs down to debutante director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films.
8205,tt0995752,10030,30,In future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions.
8206,tt0995752,10030,31,"Sorry, I don't like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies."
8207,tt0995752,10031,1,I just saw the movie in theater.
8208,tt0995752,10031,2,The movie has very few good points to talk about.
8209,tt0995752,10031,3,Kareena's beauty and a couple of songs may be.
8210,tt0995752,10031,4,Thats it.
8211,tt0995752,10031,5,The movie is a complete disappointment in all areas.
8212,tt0995752,10031,6,"Anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed, even Mumbai Indians too just now Chennai has made it to semi final."
8213,tt0995752,10031,7,But the worst I feel about the movie is the action scenes.
8214,tt0995752,10031,8,Now days Bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood.
8215,tt0995752,10031,9,But they forget that Hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real.
8216,tt0995752,10031,10,But unfortunately Bollywood directors do not have that much of time.
8217,tt0995752,10031,11,They spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie.
8218,tt0995752,10031,12,Now such too stupid action scenes may work in South as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people.
8219,tt0995752,10031,13,But in Bollywood this is certainly not going to work.
8220,tt0995752,10031,14,All the action scenes I wish I could have forwarded.
8221,tt0995752,10031,15,At the end even some Chinese people appear from nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar.
8222,tt0995752,10031,16,This is height of stupidity.
8223,tt0995752,10031,17,Audience is not paying to watch such stupidity.
8224,tt0995752,10031,18,I think Bollywood now should forget about the action movies.
8225,tt0995752,10031,19,They cant make it.
8226,tt0995752,10031,20,"The last good action I have seen was from ""Ghatak"" and ""Khiladiyon ka Khialdi""."
8227,tt0995752,10031,21,The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me.
8228,tt0995752,10031,22,Does these people see their movie after completion.
8229,tt0995752,10031,23,Can't they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using ropes is too unrealistic and childish.
8230,tt0995752,10031,24,Better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it.
8231,tt0995752,10031,25,I just want to go back to Amitabh's era where movie like Zanjeer and Deewar were having thrilling action scenes.
8232,tt0995752,10031,26,"The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than current era scenes."
8233,tt0995752,10031,27,This movie now should open the eyes of the Bollywood movie directors.
8234,tt0995752,10031,28,"Please don't make any more action movies, until you acquire the art of making it realistic."
8235,tt0995752,10032,1,The storyline was okay.
8236,tt0995752,10032,2,Akshay Kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie.
8237,tt0995752,10032,3,Kareena Kapoor looked bad.
8238,tt0995752,10032,4,There was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner.
8239,tt0995752,10032,5,I don't know why the hell did Anil Kapoor accepted such a bad role.
8240,tt0995752,10032,6,There was nothing much to do for him in the movie.
8241,tt0995752,10032,7,Just because it is a Yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is.
8242,tt0995752,10032,8,Said Ali khan was alright.
8243,tt0995752,10032,9,I think that it is high time that Indian directors and producers start thinking of Indian customers as intelligent lot.
8244,tt0995752,10032,10,What are we . fools!!!!
8245,tt0995752,10032,11,"What do they think, they will show 2 men taking on a SWAT squad to teeters and we will believe them."
8246,tt0995752,10032,12,Is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals.... they take an entire squad of 100 + policemen and no one was there to surround the palace.
8247,tt0995752,10032,13,The action was crap and I have never seen such bad action.
8248,tt0995752,10032,14,Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 30 40 policemen all shooting at him..... and he shooting back at them.
8249,tt0995752,10032,15,None of the policemen's bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen.
8250,tt0995752,10032,16,Crap.
8251,tt0995752,10032,17,CRAP.I think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement.
8252,tt0995752,10032,18,I strongly recommend NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
8253,tt0995752,10033,1,I was very displeased with this move.
8254,tt0995752,10033,2,Everything was terrible from the start.
8255,tt0995752,10033,3,"The comedy was unhumorous, the action overdone, the songs unmelodious."
8256,tt0995752,10033,4,Even the storyline was weightless.
8257,tt0995752,10033,5,"From a writer who has written successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had high expectations."
8258,tt0995752,10033,6,The actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all.
8259,tt0995752,10033,7,"Of course, Kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds."
8260,tt0995752,10033,8,I think Hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done.
8261,tt0995752,10033,9,They tend to exaggerate way too much.
8262,tt0995752,10033,10,"In Chinese films, this style works because that is their signature piece."
8263,tt0995752,10033,11,"But, Hindi cinema's signature are the songs."
8264,tt0995752,10033,12,A good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic.
8265,tt0995752,10033,13,"But, in the future, I'm sure these action movies will get much sharper."
8266,tt0995752,10033,14,Also to be noted: Comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly.
8267,tt0995752,10033,15,Good Luck next time.
8268,tt0995752,10034,1,"If there is one film which is the worst of this year it's TASHAN The first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring Dhoom 2 style film, and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe Because of it being a Yashraj film Or maybe seeing the cheesy promo But this film gave me a shock, it was even worst then Dhoom 2 and what i expected First Saif's introduction which is boring Then Saif Kareena meet, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor oh god, what he is doing in such a weird film."
8269,tt0995752,10034,2,What kinda role it is.
8270,tt0995752,10034,3,What acting is he doing.
8271,tt0995752,10034,4,"His first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts Then came Akshay who provided some nice scenes, but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff Childhood romance, overdose of childish Rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes The ending is another jokeVijay Krishna Acharya would have got 3 films more to direct, if this film had worked, thats the strategy of yashraj, only money nothing else So Vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers Music Vishal Shekhar is ordinaryPerformances Akshay Kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air, he actually provides some engaging moments Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is equally bad Anil Kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more Rest are okay"
8272,tt0995752,10035,1,Absolutely awful movie.
8273,tt0995752,10035,2,Utter waste of time.background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech.
8274,tt0995752,10035,3,"Well if you really listen closely, whatever they speak is actually unintelligible."
8275,tt0995752,10035,4,"Camera work is bad, editing is not present, background score gives a headache, action is shoddy, dialogs are unintelligible, Acting is abysmal and well Kareena used to look like a wrestler, now she looks like a starved wrestler."
8276,tt0995752,10035,5,Hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace.
8277,tt0995752,10035,6,"After spending three hours watching a movie I want to like it, but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure."
8278,tt0995752,10035,7,"Please if you want to torture yourself, go ahead watch this."
8279,tt0995752,10036,1,Sometime I fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie...
8280,tt0995752,10036,2,I had had a trauma after watching Welcome 2007 and thought that they wont do it again.
8281,tt0995752,10036,3,"But after loads of amazing promos, Tashan finally ended as heart attack."
8282,tt0995752,10036,4,"Such amazing 3 songs in promo Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein..... and what u get in the movie."
8283,tt0995752,10036,5,"Zero story, predictable plot, plenty of Akshay Kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching Kareena after her major weight loss...!!!"
8284,tt0995752,10036,6,"Music wise another major disaster... in the music album, they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they haven't thought of giving the background song of the scenes when Akshay Kumar is doing stunts...!"
8285,tt0995752,10036,7,"that song is such nice, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and that is not taken in the music album!!! : If you plan to watch this movie, i would say, watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like ...'"
8286,tt0995752,10036,8,Bachchan Bachchan Pandey...'
8287,tt0995752,10036,9,Overall very disappointed even with the way Bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad English!
8288,tt0995752,10036,10,"Go away man, i need to puke!"
8289,tt0995752,10037,1,I had never thought the standard of Yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent!
8290,tt0995752,10037,2,The film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest.
8291,tt0995752,10037,3,Saif has over acted.
8292,tt0995752,10037,4,"Kareena has improved her figure, but is not a good actress anyway."
8293,tt0995752,10037,5,Akshay is good.
8294,tt0995752,10037,6,Anil is also good.
8295,tt0995752,10037,7,May I say the role wasn't good..
8296,tt0995752,10037,8,Great deal of cheapness is filled in.
8297,tt0995752,10037,9,"Wondered if that was supposed to be the ""comedy part"" of the movie."
8298,tt0995752,10037,10,Just because last few movies were flops does that mean Yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish.
8299,tt0995752,10037,11,It has a history of so many good films.
8300,tt0995752,10037,12,"Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie."
8301,tt0995752,10038,1,"The film lacks style, i mean original style. everything looks copied including action, first appearances in the movie, songs, dialog delivery, etc etc."
8302,tt0995752,10038,2,"Yes, there the goof ups were original, like in the beginning a car is shown with number UP number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number MH ."
8303,tt0995752,10038,3,"That was one in many goof ups of the movie : Anything good in the movie. yes, for kareena fans, if there are any, Kareena in bikini."
8304,tt0995752,10038,4,"For akshay fans, his dialogs and action stunts."
8305,tt0995752,10038,5,Thats it. nothing else.
8306,tt0995752,10038,6,So watch it on your own risk and don't blame the director or actors.
8307,tt0995752,10038,7,"Director is already insane and actors, i pity them."
8308,tt0995752,10039,1,This movie is horrible.
8309,tt0995752,10039,2,THe acting is a waste basket.
8310,tt0995752,10039,3,"No crying, no action, hopeless songs."
8311,tt0995752,10039,4,Though the scenery is great.
8312,tt0995752,10039,5,I have always wanted to go to Greece.
8313,tt0995752,10039,6,"Anyway, as for Saif, you'd expect a great performance, but even he let down the people."
8314,tt0995752,10039,7,"Akshay Kumar, recognized as the pimp of Bollywood and the voice of Singhs."
8315,tt0995752,10039,8,He was sensational in this movie.
8316,tt0995752,10039,9,"For only this performance, Filmfare should introduce another award."
8317,tt0995752,10039,10,The toiletries award for the worst performance.
8318,tt0995752,10039,11,By the way the trophy should be a toilet seat.
8319,tt0995752,10039,12,Kareena Kapoor.
8320,tt0995752,10039,13,She first of all is not comparable to her sister Karisma.
8321,tt0995752,10039,14,"In acting, in looks, or in body."
8322,tt0995752,10039,15,She now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her.
8323,tt0995752,10039,16,She comes into this movie wearing bikini's and tank tops and short shorts.
8324,tt0995752,10039,17,I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan is letting his wife to be dress like that.
8325,tt0995752,10039,18,"But, she must've impressed some people dressing like that."
8326,tt0995752,10039,19,"And if you ask how, then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie."
8327,tt0995752,10039,20,They are dreaming of having Kareena Kapoor in bed naked with a condom.
8328,tt0995752,10039,21,Including me.
8329,tt0995752,10039,22,"Personally I think that she dressed like a whore, but I really liked it."
8330,tt0995752,10039,23,"I am forced to give it a 1/10, but I'd really give this movie a 0/10."
8331,tt0995752,10039,24,An unachieved film.
8332,tt0995752,10040,1,...for this movie defines a new low in Bollywood and has set the standard against which all cp must now be compared.
8333,tt0995752,10040,2,"First off, the beginning did have elements of style....and if handled well, could have become a cult classic, a la pulp fiction or a Desi desperado...but the plot was there one. begins to meander and at one point completely loses it."
8334,tt0995752,10040,3,"Throw in a deranged don with an obsession for English, a call center smart Alec, a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a Saree with the same aplomb, a levitating, gravity defying hit man and a cop with a hundred or was it a thousand black cat commandos on their trail....good ingredients in competent hands."
8335,tt0995752,10040,4,"But this is where I would like to ask the director: Sir, what were you smoking."
8336,tt0995752,10040,5,Im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of Bollywood film making for what must never be done insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers.
8337,tt0995752,10040,6,Possibly the only redeeming feature in this Desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music...watch the videos...hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed.
8338,tt0995752,10040,7,Vishal Shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes.
8339,tt0995752,10040,8,How I wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy....
8340,tt0995752,10040,9,"As I sign off, I want to really, badly know how does Akshay's bullet wound vanish in a microsecond...what were you editors doing."
8341,tt0995752,10040,10,"Tashan, maybe..."
8342,tt0995752,10041,1,"The sight of Kareena Kapoor in a two piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching Tashan ¬ó the mega disappointing, mind numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend."
8343,tt0995752,10041,2,"Bad films are bad films and we see some every week, but Tashan is not just a bad film, it's a terrible film."
8344,tt0995752,10041,3,"Terrible because it takes its audience for granted, terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they've got big movie stars onboard."
8345,tt0995752,10041,4,"Written and directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, Tashan is what you'd describe as a road movie, but one that's going in all the wrong directions."
8346,tt0995752,10041,5,"Saif Ali Khan stars as Jimmy Cliff, a call centre executive who's hired to teach English to Bhaiyyaji that's Anil Kapoor playing an ambitious UP gangster, desperate to go cool."
8347,tt0995752,10041,6,"Jimmy's got his eye on Pooja, the gangster's pretty young assistant played by Kareena Kapoor, who uses Jimmy to swindle her boss of 25 crore rupees."
8348,tt0995752,10041,7,"Determined to recover his money and also to punish both Jimmy and Pooja, Bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job."
8349,tt0995752,10041,8,"So you have Akshay Kumar as Bachchan Pandey, the gangster's faithful aide from Kanpur, who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that's hidden across the length and breadth of the country."
8350,tt0995752,10041,9,"Much like those bad eighties potboilers, Tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot."
8351,tt0995752,10041,10,"But the treatment's so over the top, so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect."
8352,tt0995752,10041,11,"Instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three act structure, you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed."
8353,tt0995752,10041,12,"That garish item song in the desert, the bullet dodging action scene at a Rajasthani fort, Kareeena's bikini moment, even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks, a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala, and believe it or not, even a Dhanno style horse driven tonga."
8354,tt0995752,10041,13,"In all fairness, not all these set pieces are badly done the item song in the desert is quite neat actually but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture, because you're just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really."
8355,tt0995752,10041,14,"Little do you expect in a seemingly fast paced road movie, to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts."
8356,tt0995752,10041,15,You see the problem with Tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making.
8357,tt0995752,10041,16,"What's more, I don't think they cared either the film reeks of arrogance."
8358,tt0995752,10041,17,"Arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work, Tashan is like an overcooked stew."
8359,tt0995752,10041,18,"There are films that kill you softly, and then there's Tashan, a film that kills you with excess."
8360,tt0995752,10041,19,"Packaged snazzily with glossy finish camera work, exotic locations and fancy costumes, every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together, but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn't hold."
8361,tt0995752,10041,20,Borrowing narrative from Tarantino and style from Stephen Chow doesn't help either because they don't blend with the film's wafer thin plot.
8362,tt0995752,10041,21,"One may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging, but Anil Kapoor's grating Hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists, and Saif Ali Khan fumbles through the film foolishly, unable to find his feet."
8363,tt0995752,10041,22,"Kareena Kapoor, meanwhile, queen of over the top delivery, does a decent job."
8364,tt0995752,10041,23,"But of course, if Tashan is salvaged to some extent, it's thanks to Akshay Kumar's irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character."
8365,tt0995752,10041,24,"You cringe when he's cupping his crotch repeatedly, and you scowl when he delivers those double meaning dialogues, but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he's up there."
8366,tt0995752,10041,25,"Despite some good music from Vishal Shekhar, the songs seem like they're only prolonging your misery."
8367,tt0995752,10041,26,Well that's because Tashan is a test of your patience.
8368,tt0995752,10041,27,"In case you didn't know, Tashan means style."
8369,tt0995752,10041,28,"I'm sorry to say, this film has none."
8370,tt0995752,10042,1,Such a long awaited movie..
8371,tt0995752,10042,2,But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day..
8372,tt0995752,10042,3,"From the trailers it looked like a action movie, but it turned out to be a out & out comedya bad comedy."
8373,tt0995752,10042,4,"But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors, they've done their part of the movie very well."
8374,tt0995752,10042,5,"Good acting, but i don't think that can save the movie.."
8375,tt0995752,10042,6,India has been shot beautifully.
8376,tt0995752,10042,7,"Kerala, Rajasthan, Ladakh. were all saturated with color, alright."
8377,tt0995752,10042,8,"Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ; Action sequences were shot very shabbily, no one could make out head & tail of the stunts, they've used Akkiakshay kumar very well but could've been done much much better.."
8378,tt0995752,10042,9,Animation is the worst i've seen in recent movies90's movies had better animation scenes i guessinitial scene where the car is falling off 'flying should be better word' the road into lake.
8379,tt0995752,10042,10,"And the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins, just to make sure audiences don't forget the movie name i guess.."
8380,tt0995752,10043,1,"I would have liked to write about the story, but there wasn't any."
8381,tt0995752,10043,2,"I would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but ""hinglish"" is only funny for like 5 minutes, after that its overkill."
8382,tt0995752,10043,3,"I would have liked to swoon over the 'keep u guessing suspense' but it was as predictable as... um mm, a Yash raj movie .."
8383,tt0995752,10043,4,"I would have liked to talk of the edge of the seat action, but I don't like cartoons much. sighAll in all, this movie is perfect for: 1. people attempting suicide I promise it'll push you over the edge 2."
8384,tt0995752,10043,5,Sado masochists this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that Silas guy in the Da Vinci code wore.
8385,tt0995752,10043,6,3
8386,tt0995752,10043,7,People researching alternative ways to spread terrorism I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4.
8387,tt0995752,10043,8,Movie Piraters: More power to them.
8388,tt0995752,10043,9,If any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch this is it.
8389,tt0995752,10043,10,5
8390,tt0995752,10043,11,"Barnacles, most types of plankton & green algae Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers."
8391,tt0995752,10043,12,"Afterthought: The director of the movie, obviously, is a species of his own."
8392,tt0995752,10043,13,And i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind..one is enoughThings that could have made this a better movie: 1.
8393,tt0995752,10043,14,A story 2.
8394,tt0995752,10043,15,A choreographer 3.
8395,tt0995752,10043,16,A Screenplay writer 4.
8396,tt0995752,10043,17,A stunt coordinator 5.
8397,tt0995752,10043,18,A story Did I already say that.
8398,tt0995752,10043,19,6
8399,tt0995752,10043,20,A director preferably one who is not mentally challenged although even one who was challenged could have done a better job 7.
8400,tt0995752,10043,21,Anil Kapoor=Bubonic plague Avoid at all costs 8.
8401,tt0995752,10043,22,"A statutory warning ""Watching Yash Raj movies is Injurious to your mental health"" ."
8402,tt0995752,10043,23,Things I liked about the movie: 1.
8403,tt0995752,10043,24,Kareena Kapoor For obvious reasons 2.
8404,tt0995752,10043,25,"The English sub titles ""Mera Dil Kho Gaya"" becomes ""My heart is in a void"" , ""Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya"" turns into ""Im a flirt, Im a lover, Im a vagabond"" ..priceless."
8405,tt0995752,10043,26,"In short, Tashan to me, is like the opposite of a Rubrics cube The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player, Tashan promises to lower your IQ, and that.. in a mere 2.5 hours!"
8406,tt0995752,10043,27,Woot!
8407,tt0995752,10043,28,sigh..
8408,tt0995752,10043,29,But thats just me.
8409,tt0995752,10043,30,I could be wrong You've been warned anyways.
8410,tt0995752,10044,1,This is the biggest Flop of 2008.
8411,tt0995752,10044,2,I don know what Director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster.
8412,tt0995752,10044,3,"The songs have been added without situations, the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it's like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people."
8413,tt0995752,10044,4,Only the best performance was by Anil Kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking Hinglish...
8414,tt0995752,10044,5,Akki is also done a good job....
8415,tt0995752,10044,6,But the movieee just forget it.
8416,tt0995752,10045,1,"All the world said that the film Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure, but this is not the case."
8417,tt0995752,10045,2,Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress Kareena Kapoor.
8418,tt0995752,10045,3,She was unbearable throughout the film.
8419,tt0995752,10045,4,Her tom boy look does not really goes well.
8420,tt0995752,10045,5,Even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all.
8421,tt0995752,10045,6,Everyone said that the Quetin Taratino of India is Vijay but its not at all Quetin.
8422,tt0995752,10045,7,The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie.
8423,tt0995752,10045,8,Anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not.
8424,tt0995752,10045,9,Akshay Kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is Saif.
8425,tt0995752,10045,10,The Style and the Phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed
8426,tt0102585,9257,1,"If you are hoping for ANYTHING new, you have chosen the wrong movie."
8427,tt0102585,9257,2,Who can think that a movie that is a virtual replay of it's predeccesors can be good.
8428,tt0102585,9257,3,Maybe the producer and maybe the director but hopefully they were not serious when they made this THING.
8429,tt0102585,9257,4,"This whole movie is like making a greatest hits DVD of the 1st 3 films, but changing the actors."
8430,tt0102585,9257,5,BHHAAAAD.
8431,tt0102585,9258,1,Its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book.
8432,tt0102585,9258,2,This poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to cram in three films into one and fails.
8433,tt0102585,9258,3,It fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one except with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films.
8434,tt0102585,9258,4,The only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not been an Omen V.
8435,tt0102585,9259,1,'The Omen 4: The Awakening' is a made for television sequel to the original 'The Omen' film.
8436,tt0102585,9259,2,"Instead of Satan possessing the body of a little boy, he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents, who is bullied at school and who ends up getting revenge against those who do her wrong."
8437,tt0102585,9259,3,"The film seems to struggle with any horror factor, and a lot of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly frightening, and it is difficult to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all of the events that surround it."
8438,tt0102585,9259,4,"I just did not find this film very suspenseful or frightening, particularly when compared to the original."
8439,tt0102585,9260,1,The only connection this movie has to horror is that it is horribly unentertaining.
8440,tt0102585,9260,2,I would rather prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit through it again.
8441,tt0102585,9260,3,Even for a TV movie it is flat.
8442,tt0102585,9260,4,The cast is boring.
8443,tt0102585,9260,5,The screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand.
8444,tt0102585,9260,6,How two directors conspired to create such a nothing movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th Century.
8445,tt0102585,9260,7,"There is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the Omen franchise, and it is shot in slo mo and cut short at the anticipated pay off."
8446,tt0102585,9260,8,"If you are tempted to see this, pop it in, set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfy."
8447,tt0102585,9260,9,"With any luck you'll doze off quickly, and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over."
8448,tt0102585,9260,10,"Namely, this movie."
8449,tt0102585,9261,1,"Since I'd seen the other three, I figured I might as well catch this made for TV fourth part of The Omen series."
8450,tt0102585,9261,2,"As a stand alone film, this movie is mediocre; but as a sequel to the 1976 masterpiece; it's a travesty."
8451,tt0102585,9261,3,The film goes along the same route that many series' go down when they're running out of ideas; that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female.
8452,tt0102585,9261,4,"It's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard, the plot lacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum."
8453,tt0102585,9261,5,"The film does keep a thread with the original, which I won't reveal as despite being obvious; that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie."
8454,tt0102585,9261,6,"The basics of the plot largely copy Richard Donner's original, and see a young couple adopt a child, which they name Delia not Damiella or Damiana, fortunately."
8455,tt0102585,9261,7,"There's a big dog involved, and a child minder; and pretty soon, the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal; as she's menstruating at eight years old, and never suffered from any illnesses..."
8456,tt0102585,9261,8,"The first two sequels to The Omen weren't bad at all, and the series really should have ended at number three."
8457,tt0102585,9261,9,"I guess there was money involved somewhere down the line, as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made."
8458,tt0102585,9261,10,"It brings nothing to the table in terms of originality, and the only thing it's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series."
8459,tt0102585,9261,11,The film looks and feels like a TV movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl.
8460,tt0102585,9261,12,"Indeed, Asia Vieira does look like a little bitch; but she never convinces that she's the Antichrist, as her stares are redundant and most of the 'evil' she does is laughable."
8461,tt0102585,9261,13,"Faye Grant is given the meatiest role, and doesn't impress; while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time."
8462,tt0102585,9261,14,"The only good thing about this movie is the theme tune, which of course has been ripped off from the original; and is overused."
8463,tt0102585,9261,15,"On the whole, this film really isn't worth seeing; as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for, and doesn't even do justice to weaker second sequel."
8464,tt0102585,9262,1,On the surface the idea of Omen 4 was good.
8465,tt0102585,9262,2,It's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl.
8466,tt0102585,9262,3,"In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when girls are possessed or are devilry it's very effective."
8467,tt0102585,9262,4,"But in Omen 4, it stunk."
8468,tt0102585,9262,5,"Delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child, rather she is a child with issues."
8469,tt0102585,9262,6,"Issues that maybe only a therapist, rather then a priest could help."
8470,tt0102585,9262,7,She does not look scary or devilish.
8471,tt0102585,9262,8,"Rather, she looks sulky and moody."
8472,tt0102585,9262,9,This film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked.
8473,tt0102585,9262,10,"But it's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies, as a made for TV movie special."
8474,tt0102585,9262,11,On so many levels it lets down.
8475,tt0102585,9262,12,"It's cheap looking, the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a TV drama."
8476,tt0102585,9262,13,"The characters do not bring any sympathy, and you do not route for them."
8477,tt0102585,9262,14,"I recently re watched it after someone brought it for me for Christmas, and it has dated appalling."
8478,tt0102585,9262,15,"If your thinking of watching this, then I would suggest that you don't."
8479,tt0102585,9262,16,"Watch one of the others, or watch the Exorcist, or watch The Good Son."
8480,tt0102585,9262,17,Just don't waste your time on this drivel!
8481,tt0102585,9263,1,What was the deal with the clothes.
8482,tt0102585,9263,2,They were all dressed like something out of the late 70's early 80s.
8483,tt0102585,9263,3,The cars were even were outdated.
8484,tt0102585,9263,4,The school was outdated.
8485,tt0102585,9263,5,"The nuns attire was outdated, and the hospital looked like something from the 40's, with its wards and wooden staircases and things."
8486,tt0102585,9263,6,Nothing in the whole movie implied it took place in 1991.
8487,tt0102585,9263,7,"My mother was laughing, saying ""Geeeee od!"
8488,tt0102585,9263,8,"WHEN was this movie MADE."""
8489,tt0102585,9263,9,"When we pressed the ""INFO BUTTON"" on our remote, we were sure 1991 had to be typo!"
8490,tt0102585,9263,10,Did anybody else notice this.
8491,tt0102585,9263,11,"My FAVORITE part, though, was when the woman tells her uppity muck husband, on the telephone, about the inverted cross in the mirror, and he just says ""Well, look, I've got a congress meeting."
8492,tt0102585,9263,12,"I'll talk to you about it later."""
8493,tt0102585,9263,13,That line was just classic.
8494,tt0102585,9263,14,JUST LIKE A MAN!
8495,tt0102585,9263,15,"My mothers favorite part was when they gave the ""Spawn of the Devil Child"" her very own Rottweiler."
8496,tt0102585,9263,16,"My mother said ""Just what the Spawn of the Devil needs... a Rottweiler"" She also enjoyed all of the people collapsing in the churches, clutching their chests."
8497,tt0102585,9263,17,"Her OTHER favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot, driving 5 miles a hour, driving right into the garbage truck/dump truck/front end loader thingee."
8498,tt0102585,9263,18,"He had about 20 seconds to just stop the car...but he just kept going, with a real dumb vacant look on his face."
8499,tt0102585,9263,19,"I mean, how fast can you GO in a school parking lot.!.!"
8500,tt0102585,9263,20,Whatever!

8506,tt0102585,9264,6,Karen York hires an eye privateMichael Lerner to investigate the weird and bizarre events.
8507,tt0102585,9264,7,"This TV sequel displays thrills, chills, creepy events and gory killing."
8508,tt0102585,9264,8,"Delia such as Damien seems to dispatch new eerie murder every few minutes of film, happening horrible killings ."
8509,tt0102585,9264,9,The chief excitement lies in watching what new and innocent victim can be made by the middling special effects.
8510,tt0102585,9264,10,"Furthermore, mediocre protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, however nice cast secondary, such as Michael Lerner,Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and the recently deceased Don S Davis, he was an Army captain turned into acting."
8511,tt0102585,9264,11,"As always , excellent musical score taken from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith."
8512,tt0102585,9264,12,The movie is exclusively for hardcore followers Omen saga.
8513,tt0102585,9264,13,The motion picture is badly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard.
8514,tt0102585,9264,14,"Previous and much better versions are the following : The immensely superior original 'Omen'Gregory Peck, Lee Remickby Richard Donner; 'Damien'William Holden, Lee Grant by Don Taylor; 'Final conflict'Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow by Grahame Baker."
8515,tt0102585,9264,15,Rating : Below average.
8516,tt0102585,9265,1,Having listened to and enjoyed Harvey Bernhard's Omen II commentary I was shocked to discover he was also behind this absolute piece of rubbish.
8517,tt0102585,9265,2,It's like a really bad TV movie you might glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too ill to reach the remote.
8518,tt0102585,9265,3,I think at the bit where Michael Lerner is confronted by what I can only describe as a high school cast of Les Miserables my mouth hung open in disbelief.
8519,tt0102585,9265,4,And then my mouth was going up and down because I was laughing so much.
8520,tt0102585,9265,5,Dire.
8521,tt0102585,9265,6,"I don't know why I have to write a minimum of ten lines, I have made my point succinctly, there's nothing clever about all this modern verbiage."
8522,tt0102585,9266,1,and it did.
8523,tt0102585,9266,2,"It is through my experience that when a horror film reaches ""franchise"" status, and subsequent titles are released thereafter, they all, in turn, become stricken by one inevitable factor: irrelevance."
8524,tt0102585,9266,3,"Omen IV: The Awakening makes no exception to this rule, featuring another small child supposedly embracing their role as the Anti Christ, foretold by a religious prophecy."
8525,tt0102585,9266,4,Haven't we seen this before.
8526,tt0102585,9266,5,"Wasn't it enough that, over the span of three films prior to this release, we've experienced the rise and fall of Damien Thorn."
8527,tt0102585,9266,6,"If you're a horror enthusiast such as myself, you'll realize that it's common for a horror movie that has many sequels and prequels to its credit to fade away into redundancy Children of the Corn, Hellraiser, Phantasm; the list goes on."
8528,tt0102585,9266,7,"At this point in the game, I'm sure you know what to expect when you're prepared to view the fourth title in a series."
8529,tt0102585,9266,8,"Regardless, there are times when you sit back and realize how shameless some filmmakers are."
8530,tt0102585,9266,9,"Omen IV: The Awakening is just that, too a shameless money making exercise."
8531,tt0102585,9266,10,This film does not offer anything new or intriguing to the Omen lineup.
8532,tt0102585,9266,11,"As unique and genuine as Omen IV tries to be compared to its siblings, the similarities and plot devices are embarrassingly alike."
8533,tt0102585,9266,12,"Elements like the guardian dog, the involvement of a priest, the skepticism of the people involved, the decapitation death scene clearly a homage to the original film when the journalist is beheaded by the sheet of glass...even right down to the father's involvement in politics and prestige within the community make it too predictable."
8534,tt0102585,9266,13,"Although it is common to star a B Rated cast into a horror title this far into a series, the acting is off the charts, chock full of ridiculousness and unintentional humor due to some of the poorly delivered lines throughout this film."
8535,tt0102585,9266,14,The atmosphere has completely vanished in comparison to the first three titles.
8536,tt0102585,9266,15,"In addition, the epic score composed by Goldsmith in the previous movies has been replaced by an auditory debacle; an absolute joke, and made me wonder if it was actually intended to be used for this film or just pulled from a ""bank"" of stock audio...which really says something, because rarely do I comment on the lousy misuse of a musical score until now."
8537,tt0102585,9266,16,"All in all, I'd call Omen IV: The Awakening a failure."
8538,tt0102585,9266,17,"In the world of horror movies that carry a long list of titles behind them, some manage to hit the mark and some don't."
8539,tt0102585,9266,18,"If you're interested in creating another notch on your weathered horror belt such as I am for completion purposes, perhaps you could carve this title into it as well if not for entertainment value, then to appreciate when a film is executed properly, or poorly."
8540,tt0102585,9267,1,"After the already disappointing ""Final Conflict"", the series hits rock bottom with this very weak fourth entry."
8541,tt0102585,9267,2,"At least the third film tried unsuccessfully to continue the story of Damien, while this one simply rehashes and copies ideas from the ""Omen"" animals are afraid of the Antichrist, the death of one man is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first film."
8542,tt0102585,9267,3,But what looked exciting and creative there looks just dumb here.
8543,tt0102585,9267,4,And the little girl looks simply like a spoiled kid.
8544,tt0102585,9268,1,"SPOILERS Like some evil Tinkers to Evers to Chance double play combination we have in ""Omen IV"" the evil seed of the deceased AntiChrist Damien Thorn come back."
8545,tt0102585,9268,2,"Terrorizing his parents his schoolmates his neighbors and finally the entire world as a she named Delia York, Asia Vieila."

8548,tt0102585,9268,5,Little Delia didn't waste any time making her peasants felt by scratching her mom at a house party.
8549,tt0102585,9268,6,"Later Delia almost get killed by a runaway truck only to have herself saved by this ""Devil Dog"" named Ryder."
8550,tt0102585,9268,7,Going to school Delia takes care of the local bully by getting the big guy to wet himself in front of all his classmates.
8551,tt0102585,9268,8,Later when his father threatens the Yorks with a law suit she has his head sliced off in a self induced traffic accident!
8552,tt0102585,9268,9,Delia is someone that you never mess with if you know what's good for you.
8553,tt0102585,9268,10,"Meanwhile Dalia's dad Gene becomes a big man in town on his own, or so he thinks, by getting elected to the congress as a champion of the clean air and green trees crowd instead of letting the smog and concrete boys take over the neighborhood with his eye now on he White House itself!"
8554,tt0102585,9268,11,Did his bratty and strange daughter Delia have anything to do with Gene York's sudden good fortune.
8555,tt0102585,9268,12,"It's only later when Jo, Ann Hearen, is hired as Delia's nanny that the truth's comes out about her strange and evil powers."
8556,tt0102585,9268,13,"Jo a New Age type realizes that Delia is a bit weird, after turning all her white crystals black, and calls her New Age Guru Noah, Jim Byrnes, to come over and check her out."
8557,tt0102585,9268,14,"Noah is so upset by what he sees in Delia Kirilian color vibrations ,all black and blue with a little pinch of red, that it flips him out so bad that he almost crashed into Delia's moms car."
8558,tt0102585,9268,15,"Taken on a trip to a psychic festival by Jo Delia turns the entire event into an inferno setting the place, through mental telepathy, on fire and heaving everyone there run for cover including poor Noah who was at the festival and ended up with his leg broken."
8559,tt0102585,9268,16,The and shaken and battered Guru was so shook up by the whole experience that he later checked out of the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan wilderness.
8560,tt0102585,9268,17,"Jo herself is later thrown out, with the help of the sweet and cuddly family pet Ryder, of a second floor window to her death because she knew and talked too much."
8561,tt0102585,9268,18,"It's when Karen is again pregnant that she decides, finally, to find out the truth about the real parents of Delia."
8562,tt0102585,9268,19,"That's when she,and we in the audience, come face to face with the truth."
8563,tt0102585,9268,20,She's not only the feared AntiChrist of Revelations she's his twin sister!
8564,tt0102585,9268,21,Her brother the AntiChrist himself is about to come on the scene as her kid brother the sill unborn Alexander York!
8565,tt0102585,9268,22,Three times were more then enough for the AntiChrist coming back to earth to bring about Armageddon.
8566,tt0102585,9268,23,The movie going public were already getting a little tired of of him and his evil adventures.
8567,tt0102585,9268,24,"With a fourth really not necessary since Daimen Thorn, the original AntiChrist, had been dead and buried for years."
8568,tt0102585,9268,25,"Were put through the usual ringer with no one believing that little Delia is ""Thee"" AntiChrist until it was almost too late to stop her in her deadly rounds of destroying the entire human race."
8569,tt0102585,9268,26,"The movie as bad as it is is also far too long, 97 minutes, for a horror flick that could well have told it's story is as little as 80 minutes."
8570,tt0102585,9268,27,"Having a private eye Earl Knight, Mchael Learner,and later a former Catholic nun sister Yvonne,Megan Lehch,and now faith healer Felichy in the film only to be killed off didn't help the plot either."
8571,tt0102585,9268,28,It only prolonged the suffering of those of us watching the movie.
8572,tt0102585,9268,29,"You could see the surprise ending coming almost as soon as the film ""Omen IV"" began with the bases being cleared for Delia's eventual takeover of the civilized as well as uncivilized world."
8573,tt0102585,9268,30,What was a bit of a surprise was Delia doing it with a little help from friends.
8574,tt0102585,9269,1,Well since seeing part's 1 through 3 I can honestly say that they should have NEVER made part 4.
8575,tt0102585,9269,2,"Everything from the tacky, and I DO mean tacky score to the really bad acting, I dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds."
8576,tt0102585,9269,3,"I mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of Damion, but without him around in this one it's just not the same."
8577,tt0102585,9269,4,"Sure by the end of part 3 I was getting a little tired of the continued story line's, but it was a good closure at the end of the third one."
8578,tt0102585,9269,5,Again there was no reason for a part 4.
8579,tt0102585,9269,6,"Even if there was they could have done a MUCH better job than this sht I had to sit through, lol."
8580,tt0102585,9269,7,There goes an hour and a half of my life i'll never see again.
8581,tt0102585,9270,1,Omen IV: The Awakening starts at the 'St.
8582,tt0102585,9270,2,"Frances Orphanage' where husband & wife Karen Faye Grant & Gene York Michael Woods are given a baby girl by Sister Yvonne Megan Leitch who they have adopted, they name her Delia."
8583,tt0102585,9270,3,"At first things go well but as the years pass & Delia Asia Vieria grows up Karen becomes suspicious of her as death & disaster follows her, Karen is convinced that she is evil itself."
8584,tt0102585,9270,4,Karen then finds out that she is pregnant but discovers a sinister plot to use her as a surrogate mother for th next Antichrist & gets a shock when she finds out who Delia's real father was...
8585,tt0102585,9270,5,Originally to be directed by Dominique Othenin Girard who either quit or was sacked & was replaced by Jorge Montesi who completed the film although why he bothered is anyone's guess as Omen IV: The Awakening is absolutely terrible & a disgrace when compared to it illustrious predecessors.
8586,tt0102585,9270,6,"The script by Brian Taggert is hilariously bad, I'm not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper but there are so many things wrong with it that I find even that hard to believe."
8587,tt0102585,9270,7,"As a serious film Omen IV: The AWakening falls flat on it's face & it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof, I mean the scene towards the end when the Detective comes face to face with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous Gothic song has to be seen to be believed & I thought it was absolutely hilarious & ridiculous in equal measure."
8588,tt0102585,9270,8,"Then there's the pointless difference between this & the other Omen films in that this time it's a young girl, the question I ask here is why."
8589,tt0102585,9270,9,"Seriously, why."
8590,tt0102585,9270,10,There's no reason at all & isn't used to any effect at all anyway.
8591,tt0102585,9270,11,Then of course there's the stupid twist at the end which claims Delia has been keeping her brother's embryo inside herself & that in a sinister conspiracy involving a group of Satan worshippers it has been implanted in Karen so she can give birth to the Antichrist is moronic & comes across as just plain daft.
8592,tt0102585,9270,12,At first it has a certain entertainment value in how bad it is but the unintentional hilarity gives way to complete boredom sooner rather than later.
8593,tt0102585,9270,13,"It's obviously impossible to know how much of Omen IV: The Awakening was directed by Girard & Montesi but you can sort of tell all was not well behind the camera as it's a shabby, cheap looking poorly made film which was actually made for TV & it shows with the bland, flat & unimaginative cinematography & production design."
8594,tt0102585,9270,14,"Then there's the total lack of scares, atmosphere, tension & gore which are the main elements that made the previous Omen films so effective."
8595,tt0102585,9270,15,The budget must have been pretty low & the film looks like it was.
8596,tt0102585,9270,16,The best most stylish thing about Omen IV: The Awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as Delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping path's but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything.
8597,tt0102585,9270,17,"I have to mention the music which sounds awful, more suited to a comedy & is very inappropriate sounding."
8598,tt0102585,9270,18,The acting is alright at best but as usual the kid annoys.
8599,tt0102585,9270,19,"Omen IV: The Awakening is rubbish, it's a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious & just ends up coming across as stupid."
8600,tt0102585,9270,20,"The change of director's probably didn't help either, that's still not a excuse though."
8601,tt0102585,9270,21,"The last Omen film to date following the original The Omen 1976, Damien: Omen II 1978 & The Final Conflict 1981 all of which are far superior to this."
8602,tt0102585,9271,1,To the small minority seen here praising this film GET SERIOUS.
8603,tt0102585,9271,2,"I know it's down to peoples personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish."
8604,tt0102585,9271,3,So bad it does not deserve to be part of this franchise.
8605,tt0102585,9271,4,I can only assume those saying how great this is are friends with somebody involved in the film and are trying to give their career a push.
8606,tt0102585,9271,5,"Poor in every way, don't con people by saying otherwise."
8607,tt0102585,9271,6,"Storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries, script is likewise."
8608,tt0102585,9271,7,Attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead WOW!
8609,tt0102585,9271,8,"don't disguise the film makers lack of ideas,and there is sadly a complete lack of any scares."
8610,tt0102585,9271,9,"Absolutely no redeeming qualities, utter utter turd."
8611,tt0102585,9271,10,I've awarded this pair of chancers one mark simply for having had the nous to get someone to fund this piece of crap.
8612,tt0102585,9271,11,They must have put more effort into that than they did into actually making the film.
8613,tt0102585,9271,12,Shame.
8614,tt0102585,9272,1,I recently decided to revisit The Omen trilogy only to discover that insert demonic music here there is a fourth.
8615,tt0102585,9272,2,"I didn't expect much from it, and in that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations."
8616,tt0102585,9272,3,"If you're into watching bad movies for a laugh, then this just may be the movie for you."
8617,tt0102585,9272,4,"Oh, where do we start."
8618,tt0102585,9272,5,"From the onset, the ""made for TV"" look and feel of the movie was obvious."
8619,tt0102585,9272,6,The music was often inappropriately matched with what was happening in the movie and therefore at best distracting.
8620,tt0102585,9272,7,The script had all the suspense of an 8 year olds work of fiction.
8621,tt0102585,9272,8,But one thing that must be said is that the lacking script was very well matched up with the appalling acting.
8622,tt0102585,9272,9,Numerous scenes left me contemplating whether it was the script or the acting that was the source of ridiculousness.
8623,tt0102585,9272,10,"The story itself is quite thin, centering on all the crazy antics of the daughter of Damien Thorn, adopted out by wrong doing and badly acted nuns."
8624,tt0102585,9272,11,"There is the usual lot of mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally made me yawn as the ""drama"" unfolded, and the usual third party investigator into the whole affair."
8625,tt0102585,9272,12,"Later, via some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn Jnr is born."
8626,tt0102585,9272,13,And that pretty much wraps up the plot.
8627,tt0102585,9272,14,The whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous and/or ridiculous scene after another.
8628,tt0102585,9272,15,There were many WTF.!. moments too that provides the unintended comedy relief.
8629,tt0102585,9272,16,"For example, what's with the major over reaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mother's cheek.."
8630,tt0102585,9272,17,Hardly a 360 degree head turning omen.
8631,tt0102585,9272,18,I also laughed at the over reaction at the baptism.
8632,tt0102585,9272,19,"The baby cries, and everyone looks very concerned."
8633,tt0102585,9272,20,The distressed mother runs out of the church and the priest is left looking very alarmed while crossing himself.
8634,tt0102585,9272,21,Huh.
8635,tt0102585,9272,22,Then there is the new age nanny that seems to have carte blanche on exposing an 8 year old to all kind of alternative spiritualism.
8636,tt0102585,9272,23,I laughed when the nanny suggested bringing the troubled Delia to a psychic fair to meet the nanny's hippie friends and the mother just shrugs her shoulders and allows it.
8637,tt0102585,9272,24,"""Yeah that's groovy, fill my troubled 8 year old daughter's head with all this mysticism stuff."
8638,tt0102585,9272,25,That's cool.
8639,tt0102585,9272,26,"I don't need to be there."""
8640,tt0102585,9272,27,Of course this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown Rottweiler they encounter on the street that could bite the little girls head off as a snack.
8641,tt0102585,9272,28,"The entire scene at the psychic fair is quite comical in a slapstick kinda way, from the horrified reactionary stares of the psychics to Delia, to the ensuing inferno."
8642,tt0102585,9272,29,"I also laughed at how the nun's death is considered a ""freak accident""."
8643,tt0102585,9272,30,"Here we have a religious zealot, who is described as being part of a cult, who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove how God's Glory will protect them."
8644,tt0102585,9272,31,She antagonizes the snakes by handling them and SOMEHOW she is bitten several times.
8645,tt0102585,9272,32,Hardly a freak accident.
8646,tt0102585,9272,33,More like a successful suicide attempt.
8647,tt0102585,9272,34,The snakes vs nun scene wasn't the only comical death.
8648,tt0102585,9272,35,There is the slow speed car accident resulting in decapitation in a school parking lot.
8649,tt0102585,9272,36,Then there is the slow motion demolition ball headed straight for the detective.
8650,tt0102585,9272,37,"I believe I may have gone and made a coffee when the slow motion started only to come back to see the demolition ball still headed straight for the ""concerned"" detective."
8651,tt0102585,9272,38,"Then there is the quintessential who shot who clich√© death, where a gun goes off and both act as if they have been shot for several seconds while exchanging horrified glances."
8652,tt0102585,9272,39,Then someone goes tumbling down the stairs revealing who the real victim was.
8653,tt0102585,9272,40,"Additionally, the death of the priest at the beginning of the movie seemed a little strange and pointless to me."
8654,tt0102585,9272,41,He runs around looking at the architecture of the church.
8655,tt0102585,9272,42,"Obviously finding this quite distressing, he eventually collapses, clutching his chest and dies."
8656,tt0102585,9272,43,"Apparently something demonic was happening, as this is what the music was suggesting."
8657,tt0102585,9272,44,Ummm.
8658,tt0102585,9272,45,OK.
8659,tt0102585,9272,46,"I am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and, in particularly, as a ""worthy sequel""."
8660,tt0102585,9272,47,"It is difficult not to notice the non sensical script, the unrealistic acting, and the inappropriate musical score."
8661,tt0102585,9272,48,"The movie lacks any suspense, relying heavily on Delia's ""demonic stare"" to provide a sense of horror, which becomes rather annoying after a short time."
8662,tt0102585,9272,49,Bottom line : This is a bad movie with the only redeeming feature being it's unintended potential for being a comedy.
8663,tt0102585,9273,1,The first question that springs to mind after watching this rubbish is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the Omen name on this movie.
8664,tt0102585,9273,2,"It is a shambolic , embarrassing, pathetic atempt to carry on the Omen franchise."
8665,tt0102585,9273,3,When the film starts the backing music sounds like it has been lifted straight from a Bugs Bunny Cartoon and from then on the film gets worse!
8666,tt0102585,9273,4,I dont know who wrote the script but i bet they got a E for it when they took it back to show their teacher!
8667,tt0102585,9273,5,It is difficult after a while to tell if this is a comedy because what happens is so funny and so un true to the original Omen it beggers belief.
8668,tt0102585,9273,6,"The acting is laughable , especially from the leading lady Faye Grant. she keeps pulling silly faces or is she finding it difficult not to laugh."
8669,tt0102585,9273,7,It's hard to tell.
8670,tt0102585,9273,8,THE worst sequal i have ever had the misfortune to witness. 1 out of 10.
8671,tt0102585,9274,1,This sequel is a total rehash of the first film.
8672,tt0102585,9274,2,A completely pointless movie.
8673,tt0102585,9274,3,It basically just took every single sceanrio of the first film and they redid it in Omen IV except with a female antichrist this time.
8674,tt0102585,9274,4,It even ends the same way as the first one!
8675,tt0102585,9274,5,"The music is too busy and interfering, and because its pretty much a copy of Omen I, it's extremely predictable."
8676,tt0102585,9274,6,"It's not a horrible movie, it's not terribly made, there is much worse movies out there, this just had absolutely no point in being made."
8677,tt0102585,9274,7,"The Omen remake from 2006 is much worse, even more pointless than this, so I guess it has that."
8678,tt0102585,9274,8,"If you someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke, I guess I'd choose this."
8679,tt0102585,9275,1,Omen IV 1991 was a bad made for T.V. movie.
8680,tt0102585,9275,2,"Since the 80's were over, I guess the executives were experimenting in meth the drug of choice during the 90's because there is no other reason to explain this travesty."
8681,tt0102585,9275,3,Why did they even bother making this.
8682,tt0102585,9275,4,A t.v. movie.
8683,tt0102585,9275,5,What were they mulling over when this one came up on the idea board.
8684,tt0102585,9275,6,Did they even think for a second that this movie would catch on as.
8685,tt0102585,9275,7,Perhaps they thought it could make it as a series.
8686,tt0102585,9275,8,We'll never know.
8687,tt0102585,9275,9,But I know one thing.
8688,tt0102585,9275,10,This movie was the major reason why I never bought the Omen trilogy.
8689,tt0102585,9275,11,"They should have knocked off a couple of bucks instead of putting out this ""extra"" disc."
8690,tt0102585,9275,12,Omen IV is basically a average American family remake of the first film.
8691,tt0102585,9275,13,"Instead of a snot nosed punk kid, we get the spooky girl who's a total brat to everyone around her."
8692,tt0102585,9275,14,"If the family had stronger parenting skills, then none of the demonic events that have transpired in the past films would have never occurred."
8693,tt0102585,9275,15,These parents need to put their foot down and do some real discipline!
8694,tt0102585,9275,16,"Not recommended, best to avoid at all cost!"
8695,tt0102585,9276,1,This is a truly wretched little film.
8696,tt0102585,9276,2,"Admittedly the original unholy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns with the third, ""The Final Conflict"" degenerating into a ridiculous sub plot about half way through the film apparently merely to provide the requisite needlessly convoluted deaths that had by now become the whole raison d'etre for the ""Omen"" series."
8697,tt0102585,9276,3,"But then to foist this jumped up TV movie beware purchasers of the Omen box set on DVD don't be fooled by the widescreen ratio of the transfer, this was and is strictly small screen stuff on the back of a series of generally fine demonic chillers was unforgivable, particularly, endorsed as it was, by the exec.producer and producer of the first three movies Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard."
8698,tt0102585,9276,4,"I'd give away the plot if there was any, besides the usual death scenes hopelessly toned down for TV sensibilities and some of the worst acting I've seen."
8699,tt0102585,9276,5,"All involved in this project down to the catering people should be ashamed this travesty ever made it to the screen, let alone masquerading under the Omen name."
8700,tt0102585,9276,6,"If one person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess, I'll feel better for it."
8701,tt0102585,9277,1,I saw the omen when i was 11 on tv.
8702,tt0102585,9277,2,I enjoyed the Trilogy.
8703,tt0102585,9277,3,So when the chance to finally see one at the cinema came around i didnt pass it up.
8704,tt0102585,9277,4,I went in to the cinema knowing that what i was about to see wasnt a cinema release but a made for TV film.
8705,tt0102585,9277,5,However being a fan i couldnt resist.
8706,tt0102585,9277,6,But this Omen movie which i saw at a midnight screening didnt bring chills it brought laughter.
8707,tt0102585,9277,7,"Risible Dialogue such as ""it is written that if a baby cries during baptism they reject there god""."
8708,tt0102585,9277,8,What nonsense.
8709,tt0102585,9277,9,No decent set pieces.
8710,tt0102585,9277,10,Faye Grant so Good in V is wasted with this script from hell.
8711,tt0102585,9277,11,No suprises and no fun.
8712,tt0102585,9277,12,However i did laugh out loud several times at our bad it was.
8713,tt0102585,9277,13,Truly Pathetic.1 out of 10
8714,tt0102585,9278,1,The fact that I watched this entire movie says something about it...or me.
8715,tt0102585,9278,2,It is not a good movie.
8716,tt0102585,9278,3,Terrible in fact.
8717,tt0102585,9278,4,But terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away.
8718,tt0102585,9278,5,It would have made a great MST3K subject!
8719,tt0102585,9278,6,"Most of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, contrived plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience."
8720,tt0102585,9278,7,"You'll thrill to slo mo death sequences, the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom, facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths."
8721,tt0102585,9278,8,"Your heart will be warmed by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off, but WHO'S SHOT."
8722,tt0102585,9278,9,"Both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then seemingly 15 minutes later, one finally goes down."
8723,tt0102585,9278,10,"You'll sing along in latin of course with the street carolers that turn into a ghastly death's choir that, for a moment, threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical."
8724,tt0102585,9278,11,"So if you believe like I do that as movies get worse they get better, then this might be a decent choice for you."
8725,tt0102585,9278,12,"It's not as funny as my current sci fi schlock favorite, ""They Live"" featuring Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch than luke warm movies like Omen II or III.I give it 4 out of 10."
8726,tt0102585,9279,1,"As with many other pop culture franchise series, this line just didn't know when to quit."
8727,tt0102585,9279,2,"Instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended, they went on to generate this; the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark."
8728,tt0102585,9279,3,This movie should never have happened.
8729,tt0102585,9279,4,"It was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line, and it sure shows."
8730,tt0102585,9279,5,The premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same.
8731,tt0102585,9279,6,"After the wonderful experience which was The Omen, this was a major disappointment which stank of 70's cheese and horrible acting."
8732,tt0102585,9279,7,"It was reminiscent of the Amityville Horror in those aspects, and left a terrible, lingering stench long after it was over."
8733,tt0102585,9279,8,It rates a 1.4/10 from...the Fiend :.
8734,tt0102585,9280,1,"honestly, i don't know what's funnier, this horrific remake, or the comments on this board."
8735,tt0102585,9280,2,"Masterpiece's review had me in tears, that's so funny."
8736,tt0102585,9280,3,"Anyway, this movie is the among the worst movies ever, and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels."
8737,tt0102585,9280,4,"The ""Omen"" name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on HBO, but it's a slap in the face to the other three, especially the original."
8738,tt0102585,9280,5,"There are so many classically bad moments, but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair!!"
8739,tt0102585,9280,6,good times !
8740,tt0102585,9280,7,"This movie is to the Omen series what ""Scary Movie"" is to the entire genre."
8741,tt0102585,9280,8,Avoid unless you're looking for a good laugh.
8742,tt0102585,9281,1,Only the Antichrist could have been behind such a disaster.
8743,tt0102585,9281,2,"One only hopes that this irony was the motivating force behind the ""film""!"
8744,tt0102585,9281,3,"This movie was so bad, it forced me to register with IMDb, finally, just so I could trash it."
8745,tt0102585,9281,4,What makes this movie all the more tragic is that it had such GREAT source material!
8746,tt0102585,9281,5,I have never seen a movie where all the elements were so grotesquely mediocre as to render the result less than the sum of its parts.
8747,tt0102585,9281,6,"It may seem insignificant, but I'd like to start with the score."
8748,tt0102585,9281,7,"As the proud owner of a music degree, I must register my indignation!"
8749,tt0102585,9281,8,"I was torn between laughter and dry heaves as I listened to what John Scheffer did to Goldsmith's brilliant score; it was far more gruesome than any of the burlesque death scenes, and almost as inadvertently comedic."
8750,tt0102585,9281,9,"It was by far the most inappropriate score I've heard since, well, I really can't think of a worse one."
8751,tt0102585,9281,10,Maybe JAWS 4.
8752,tt0102585,9281,11,As for the plot...
8753,tt0102585,9281,12,I'm sorry.
8754,tt0102585,9281,13,New Age mysticism...
8755,tt0102585,9281,14,What ever happened to the gritty realism of the original trilogy.
8756,tt0102585,9281,15,"In those films more so in the first two than the third, but still!!"
8757,tt0102585,9281,16,"the supernatural was for the most part implied, and it was this subtlety that made the movies so eerily believable."
8758,tt0102585,9281,17,Here we have crystals going black calling all Skeksis and Mystics!!
8759,tt0102585,9281,18,"and inverted crucifixes galore, even though in certain scenes the crucifux would be perfectly normal but for the camera angle."
8760,tt0102585,9281,19,"Gone is the refined psychlogical manipulation tapping the malaise inherent in our collective psyche: in its place a boorish ""slap in the face"" of recycled clich√© and transparent incompetence."
8761,tt0102585,9281,20,"Add to that a lead ""actress"" so unbelievably ANNOYING that you fervently thank the director for those scenes from which she is absent."
8762,tt0102585,9281,21,"Never have I seen a little girl so fundamentally irritating since little Stephanie ruined ALL IN THE FAMILY.Other than that, I have no strong feelings on the subject ; Luckily the first three films are sufficiently adroit as to render this train wreck of wasted celluloid inconsequential or, at the very most, a study in how NOT to make a film."
8763,tt0102585,9281,22,Viewer beware!
8764,tt0102585,9281,23,May induce vomiting if you're lucky.
8765,tt0102585,9282,1,This movie is unworthy of the Omen title.
8766,tt0102585,9282,2,It is so bad that it has actually damaged the classic nature of the first three.
8767,tt0102585,9282,3,"It never should have been made, they ought to change the title."
8768,tt0102585,9282,4,They don't even spell Damien Thorn's NAME correctly!!!!
8769,tt0102585,9282,5,"And there are no daggers, the most important element of all the Omen films."
8770,tt0102585,9282,6,Pull it from the shelves and burn it.
8771,tt0201290,10991,1,My brother is an avid DVD collector.
8772,tt0201290,10991,2,He took one look at the cover two models on toilets and had to add it to his collection.
8773,tt0201290,10991,3,I stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie I use that term loosely I've felt obligated to sit through.
8774,tt0201290,10991,4,"I dared not make eye contact with my brother, quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist."
8775,tt0201290,10991,5,"The biggest name in the whole movie is Michael Clark Duncan who appears in one scene, which the ""filmmaker"" decided to show every take of about four total throughout the movie."
8776,tt0201290,10991,6,"In fact, the whole movie pretty much follows this suit."
8777,tt0201290,10991,7,The fact that the DVD contained deleted footage was a shock.
8778,tt0201290,10991,8,"I went to bed without viewing it, however."
8779,tt0201290,10991,9,"To no surprise at all, I found this disc without its case behind the TV about a week later."
8780,tt0201290,10992,1,"The Underground Comedy Movie, is possibly the worst train wrecks I've ever seen."
8781,tt0201290,10992,2,"Luckily I didn't pay for this movie, and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was."
8782,tt0201290,10992,3,I love off color comedy.
8783,tt0201290,10992,4,I figured at the least it would have that and I would be entertained.
8784,tt0201290,10992,5,"No, instead the acting was so awful, the ""jokes"" were extremely cheesy, and the plot was no where to be found."
8785,tt0201290,10992,6,Maybe there wasn't supposed to be a plot so I can't hold that against this movie.
8786,tt0201290,10992,7,It's pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat.....by Batman...
8787,tt0201290,10992,8,A man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat.
8788,tt0201290,10992,9,Hilarious.
8789,tt0201290,10992,10,Simply genius.
8790,tt0201290,10992,11,I got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it.
8791,tt0201290,10992,12,Perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didn't understand.
8792,tt0201290,10992,13,Or perhaps it's the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the Arctic Ocean.
8793,tt0201290,10992,14,P.S.
8794,tt0201290,10992,15,Don't buy this movie!
8795,tt0201290,10993,1,"Sure, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we in fact enjoy them, This however, wasn't even a guilty pleasure, it was just crap."
8796,tt0201290,10993,2,"Some guy, vince offer, who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk/high probably both and thought it was a great idea to make a movie."
8797,tt0201290,10993,3,He then proceeded to show his script to equally high/drunk individuals.
8798,tt0201290,10993,4,"Overall, this movie was so bad, predictable, and unoriginal I couldn't get through 20 minutes of it before I turned it off."
8799,tt0201290,10993,5,It makes You Got Served look like Citizen Kane.
8800,tt0201290,10993,6,Bat Man.
8801,tt0201290,10993,7,WTF...
8802,tt0201290,10993,8,"Some guy that walks around with a bat, real original."
8803,tt0201290,10993,9,"Almost as good as calling him Fat Man, and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit."
8804,tt0201290,10994,1,Sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one.
8805,tt0201290,10994,2,You can only stand about 5 minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back.
8806,tt0201290,10994,3,I will now look at Michael Clarke Duncan with apprehension...why....he lent his name to this vermin.
8807,tt0201290,10995,1,Anyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie.
8808,tt0201290,10995,2,I first saw ads for this movie back in 2001.
8809,tt0201290,10995,3,"It looked like it could be funny, but I wasn't about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first."
8810,tt0201290,10995,4,I figured I would wait until the movie was available to rent at Blockbuster.
8811,tt0201290,10995,5,"About a year and a half later, I was at Tower Records and in the ""DVDS for less than $20"" pile, there was a copy of this movie."
8812,tt0201290,10995,6,Seeing that the DVD was only $6.99 I decided to buy it.
8813,tt0201290,10995,7,"I got home, put the disc in the DVD player, and waited for the laughs to start...and I waited some more."
8814,tt0201290,10995,8,The laughs never came.
8815,tt0201290,10995,9,I'd have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this movie was horrible.
8816,tt0201290,10995,10,"Sick, desperately tasteless, and poorly written and directed, THE UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time."
8817,tt0201290,10995,11,No stars.
8818,tt0201290,10996,1,The Underground Comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies I've ever seen.
8819,tt0201290,10996,2,"I should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase ""guaranteed to offend"" written on it... meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh."
8820,tt0201290,10996,3,"This movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits, bad characters, and worse jokes... from the pathetic Bat Man sketch to the painfully unfunny Arnold Shvollenpecker skit, they just aren't funny."
8821,tt0201290,10996,4,"The few skits that are a little funny are few and far between watching Micheal Clark Duncan play a gay virgin, for example but even they go on too long and get ruined from Vince Offer's ineptness at comedy."
8822,tt0201290,10996,5,Keep The Underground Comedy Movie underground... bury it!
8823,tt0201290,10997,1,First of all.....
8824,tt0201290,10997,2,What the hell.
8825,tt0201290,10997,3,"Why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night TV with the promise of disturbing, offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn't watch."
8826,tt0201290,10997,4,"What the crap is funny about a dog being injured, a grandma getting her head knocked off...a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom. what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick."
8827,tt0201290,10997,5,"Anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny, should not even be allowed to walk the earth."
8828,tt0201290,10997,6,But from what I hear its not even offensive...so...they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage...and they cant even pull that off.
8829,tt0201290,10998,1,"This movie goes beyond just being bad, it is definitively the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life."
8830,tt0201290,10998,2,"Unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film, if you can call it that."
8831,tt0201290,10999,1,Imagine the worst skits from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90 minute movie.
8832,tt0201290,10999,2,"Now, imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity."
8833,tt0201290,10999,3,Now imagine something 50 times worse.
8834,tt0201290,10999,4,Got that.
8835,tt0201290,10999,5,"Ok, now go see The Underground Comedy Movie."
8836,tt0201290,10999,6,That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever.
8837,tt0201290,10999,7,UCM is the single worst movie I've ever seen.
8838,tt0201290,10999,8,There were a few cheap laughs...very few.
8839,tt0201290,10999,9,But it was lame.
8840,tt0201290,10999,10,"Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame, it was too lame to be funny."
8841,tt0201290,10999,11,The only reason I'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else I know bought it.
8842,tt0201290,10999,12,He wasted his money.
8843,tt0201290,10999,13,Vince Offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's not surprise why.
8844,tt0201290,11000,1,Words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is.
8845,tt0201290,11000,2,"It is a series of random, unfunny clips about everything from a stupid Batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady REALLY disturbing."
8846,tt0201290,11000,3,"The only remotely amusing thing about the Underground Comedy Movie is watching Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie."
8847,tt0201290,11000,4,"Also, it is rated NC 17, shunning away the only people that might tolerate it."
8848,tt0201290,11001,1,I have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru...not one laugh in it.
8849,tt0201290,11001,2,"Ok, maybe one little chuckle for the Michael Clarke Duncan bit as the big, black, bald gay virgin."
8850,tt0201290,11001,3,But the rest of it was shockingly un funny.
8851,tt0201290,11001,4,"On top of being void of any laughs the ""skits"" go on forever!"
8852,tt0201290,11001,5,Steer clear of this one if you value your time and money.
8853,tt0201290,11001,6,DREADFUL!!!
8854,tt0201290,11001,7,The worst!!!
8855,tt0201290,11002,1,"Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE Guess what."
8856,tt0201290,11002,2,"It worked, I'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this."
8857,tt0201290,11002,3,Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true.
8858,tt0201290,11002,4,Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us!
8859,tt0201290,11002,5,It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man.
8860,tt0201290,11002,6,"I generally avoid the crappy ones, but got sucked into this one."
8861,tt0201290,11002,7,"We have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been revoked."
8862,tt0201290,11002,8,"There is nothing remotely funny about this movie...even the ""adventures of dickman"" scene was sophomoric at best.."
8863,tt0201290,11002,9,Color me ped.
8864,tt0201290,11002,10,Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason...no..it just sucked.
8865,tt0201290,11002,11,NEVER WATCH THIS!
8866,tt0201290,11002,12,for any reason whatsoever.
8867,tt0201290,11002,13,Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny.
8868,tt0201290,11002,14,That's saying ALOT.
8869,tt0201290,11002,15,"Please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity never view this movie."
8870,tt0201290,11002,16,"It's many things stupid, pointless, and worthless to name a few."
8871,tt0201290,11002,17,But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny it failed miserably.
8872,tt0201290,11002,18,Crash and burn....
8873,tt0201290,11003,1,How do I begin.
8874,tt0201290,11003,2,This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen .
8875,tt0201290,11003,3,It has no redeemable qualities .
8876,tt0201290,11003,4,I just sat through this movie and it was a struggle.
8877,tt0201290,11003,5,It failed to get even a single smile on my face.
8878,tt0201290,11003,6,I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film.
8879,tt0201290,11003,7,I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor.
8880,tt0201290,11003,8,"The only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure thats the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place."
8881,tt0201290,11003,9,I will wrap this up as I am going to try and forget the time I just wasted with this piece of crap.
8882,tt0201290,11003,10,I will leave you with this warning.
8883,tt0201290,11003,11,"DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM ,IT SUCKS."
8884,tt0201290,11004,1,It really impresses me that it got made.
8885,tt0201290,11004,2,The director/writer/actor must be really charismatic in reality.
8886,tt0201290,11004,3,I can think of no other way itd pass script stage.
8887,tt0201290,11004,4,What I want you to consider is this...while watching the films I was feeling sorry for the actors.
8888,tt0201290,11004,5,"It felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there, not enjoying it, just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying."
8889,tt0201290,11004,6,"Id really like to know what the budget is, guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor."
8890,tt0201290,11004,7,"I want to write 'the jokes didn't appeal to me'. but the reality is for them to appeal to you, you'd have to be the man who wrote them. or a retard."
8891,tt0201290,11004,8,So imagine that in script form...and this guy got THAT green lit.
8892,tt0201290,11004,9,Thats impressive isn't it.
8893,tt0201290,11005,1,"This movie shows a row of sketches, which partly pass over into one another."
8894,tt0201290,11005,2,"I realized the passing over late in the movie, at first it only irritated me."
8895,tt0201290,11005,3,"Many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact, using absurdity and obscenity."
8896,tt0201290,11005,4,The attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails.
8897,tt0201290,11005,5,"My personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie My god, it hurts in my head every time I call it ""movie"": A bold attempt to turn nothing into something great."
8898,tt0201290,11005,6,But it failed.
8899,tt0201290,11005,7,At least the director made something out of nothing.
8900,tt0201290,11005,8,But it isn't something good.
8901,tt0201290,11005,9,"Many movies didn't turn out as funny as they were planned, but this one tops them all."
8902,tt0201290,11005,10,It's the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making.
8903,tt0201290,11005,11,No.
8904,tt0201290,11005,12,"To correct myself, it's even worse than that."
8905,tt0201290,11005,13,"A movie with gags so bad, that they aren't funny at all."
8906,tt0201290,11005,14,"It's not even fun to watch the lead actor, writer and director all three the same guy by the way perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies."
8907,tt0201290,11005,15,The movie is too bad for that.
8908,tt0201290,11006,1,"This film stars, among others, ""SlapChop"" Vince Offer who also wrote, edited and directed and Joey Buttafuoco not exactly names that scream out ""quality""."
8909,tt0201290,11006,2,"And with such uplifting skits as ""Supermodels taking a dump"" it's exactly what it sounds like, a guy who robs a sperm bank the ""Rhymer"", necrophilia with a rotting corpse, black market fetuses featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar, lots and lots of gay jokes, a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions."
8910,tt0201290,11006,3,"The skits are painfully unfunny such as ""Batman and Rhymer"", the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude...and stupid."
8911,tt0201290,11006,4,I truly believe a group of 8 year olds could have EASILY made a funnier film with the same budget.
8912,tt0201290,11006,5,"Apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by ""Slap Shot"" Vince against the Scientologists."
8913,tt0201290,11006,6,"Frankly, I wouldn't know who to root for in this case!!!"
8914,tt0201290,11006,7,"Apparently, he alleged that somehow Scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film."
8915,tt0201290,11006,8,"No matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and 99% unfunny by comparison, Ebola is funnier...and these are the nicest things I can say about the movie."
8916,tt0201290,11006,9,"By the way, that IS Bobby Lee from ""Mad TV"" wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film."
8917,tt0201290,11006,10,It's amazing his career could overcome this.
8918,tt0201290,11007,1,Lately they have been trying to hock this film late night on cable TV commercials.
8919,tt0201290,11007,2,Don't believe the hype.
8920,tt0201290,11007,3,I was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres.
8921,tt0201290,11007,4,"This is, in my opinion, the 3rd Worst Movie of All Time, just behind Mac & Me #1 Worst, and Jack Frost #2 Worst, but I must admit, they are all close and all TERRIBLE!"
8922,tt0201290,11007,5,"Really, nothing of this movie is funny, or disturbing, or anything else it claims to be so don't waste your money."
8923,tt0201290,11007,6,The only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy.
8924,tt0201290,11007,7,I'm not lying about that.
8925,tt0201290,11007,8,Someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film.
8926,tt0201290,11007,9,It is that awful.
8927,tt0201290,11007,10,"If you don't believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this, which I doubt you can finish."
8928,tt0201290,11007,11,Two Thumbs Enthusiastically Down.
8929,tt0201290,11008,1,I bought this at tower records after seeing the info mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central.
8930,tt0201290,11008,2,I was actually really looking forward to watching this.
8931,tt0201290,11008,3,My god where did i go wrong.
8932,tt0201290,11008,4,"Now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies, hell i own over 1,500 dvd's!"
8933,tt0201290,11008,5,"With that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have EVER seen."
8934,tt0201290,11008,6,"I tried to give it a chance, but not only was it not funny."
8935,tt0201290,11008,7,"It had no point, did not offend what so ever and was all around stupid."
8936,tt0201290,11008,8,God who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny. this is going right to the bottom of the bin...
8937,tt0201290,11009,1,I rated this movie as AWFUL 1.
8938,tt0201290,11009,2,"After watching the trailer, I thought this movie could be pretty cool."
8939,tt0201290,11009,3,"""Guaranteed to offend...everyone!"""
8940,tt0201290,11009,4,the trailer said.
8941,tt0201290,11009,5,"Well...it did offend me, because this movie really sucks."
8942,tt0201290,11009,6,"It is hardly a comedy, as I laughed about two seconds during the entire movie."
8943,tt0201290,11009,7,And what's with all the gays in this movie.
8944,tt0201290,11009,8,"I'm not gay and I don't have a problem with those who are, but what's the point of adding so many gay scenes in a so called comedy movie, when these scenes are absolutely not funny."
8945,tt0201290,11009,9,"I guess the director is a gay man in denial, or something like that."
8946,tt0201290,11009,10,"So my advice to you is: if you want to waste good money, go rent a good comedy you've already seen a million times, you'll be better off than watching this Mother Of All Lousy Comedy's."
8947,tt0201290,11009,11,It really is total crap.
8948,tt0201290,11010,1,This movie doesn't even deserve a one.
8949,tt0201290,11010,2,This was an utter waste of time.
8950,tt0201290,11010,3,It was a waste of film and money.
8951,tt0201290,11010,4,It was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting.
8952,tt0201290,11010,5,My spoiler is one that I think should be read by everyone.
8953,tt0201290,11010,6,There is full frontal nudity and disgusting language.
8954,tt0201290,11010,7,"But not only that, there is NO plot line, the actors are terrible, the accents are horrible, the actors are small time and I was even EXCITED to watch this movie!"
8955,tt0201290,11010,8,"The only reason I rented it was for Brian van Holt who got only a fifteen second part, by the way."
8956,tt0201290,11010,9,"I think this might have been a mistake on the directors and editors parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times, adding only a new sentence."
8957,tt0201290,11010,10,"A film similar to this is Eraser Head, possibly the most disturbing movie in existence."
8958,tt0201290,11010,11,"There is no plot line, and is not funny."
8959,tt0201290,11010,12,Although it isn't trying to be funny.
8960,tt0201290,11010,13,DO NOT WATCH EITHER MOVIE.
8961,tt0201290,11011,1,A series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day.
8962,tt0201290,11011,2,"Not as mind numbingly awful as say ""Freddy Got Fingered"" or ""Lost Reality"", but that in NO way is an endorsement in ANY way, sense or form."
8963,tt0201290,11011,3,Features the worst rhyming clown ever.
8964,tt0201290,11011,4,Any most if it isn't offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct.
8965,tt0201290,11011,5,"It also has the worst song parody EVER put on film, the WORST Arnold impersonation EVER not just the worst put on film, literally the worst EVER."
8966,tt0201290,11011,6,"I have NO clue why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan, or Slash would star in this the reasons I watched this in the first place The only thing mildly amusing was Dickman."
8967,tt0201290,11011,7,"In conclusion I would't recommend this film to ANYONE, but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the Bottom 250 on this site are pathetic."
8968,tt0201290,11011,8,Do something notable with you lives people.
8969,tt0201290,11011,9,"Plus if it's true the Church of Scientalogy hates him, he can't be ALL bad."
8970,tt0201290,11011,10,My Grade: D
8971,tt0201290,11012,1,"And I repeat, please do not see this movie!"
8972,tt0201290,11012,2,This is more than a review.
8973,tt0201290,11012,3,This is a warning.
8974,tt0201290,11012,4,"This sets the record for the worst, most effortless comedy ever made."
8975,tt0201290,11012,5,"At least with most of the recent comedies nowadays, the gags are crude and flat, but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny."
8976,tt0201290,11012,6,"I never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos: Everyone thinks they can do comedy, and only 10 percent of them are right."
8977,tt0201290,11012,7,Comedy is hard!
8978,tt0201290,11012,8,This is not some genre any fool can play around with.
8979,tt0201290,11012,9,"I think it's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to ""Kentucky Fried Movie."""
8980,tt0201290,11012,10,"Basically, these bozos are comparing their so called comic talents to those of the brilliant Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers."
8981,tt0201290,11012,11,"Come on, I've seen Pauly Shore movies that are 10 times funnier than ""The Underground Comedy Movie."""
8982,tt0201290,11012,12,Here's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie: One sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named Dkman.
8983,tt0201290,11012,13,The whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen.
8984,tt0201290,11012,14,That's it.
8985,tt0201290,11012,15,That's the whole joke.
8986,tt0201290,11012,16,Wow.
8987,tt0201290,11012,17,This is enough to make Carrot Top roll his eyes.
8988,tt0201290,11012,18,Another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie.
8989,tt0201290,11012,19,"And in another sketch, there's a bag lady beauty contest, in which we're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini clad middle aged women with beer guts and stretch marks."
8990,tt0201290,11012,20,"Plus, making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny."
8991,tt0201290,11012,21,It's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped.
8992,tt0201290,11012,22,The whole movie is supposed to be a satire.
8993,tt0201290,11012,23,I think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire...is TRUTH!!!
8994,tt0201290,11012,24,"For anybody who actually enjoyed this crap, explain to me what is truthful about ANY of these gags!"
8995,tt0201290,11012,25,"Some of the sketches might've sounded funny on paper, but anybody who's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper, it probably won't be funny on screen."
8996,tt0201290,11012,26,"If I tell someone about a big, black, muscular gay virgin, who's saving himself for the right man, he or she would probably laugh."
8997,tt0201290,11012,27,But watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag.
8998,tt0201290,11012,28,"I hate how whenever people criticize a low brow comedy like this for not being funny, they're regarded as stuck up squares."
8999,tt0201290,11012,29,"I just saw ""White Chicks"" recently."
9000,tt0201290,11012,30,"That's another low brow, politically incorrect comedy, but I laughed my head off."
9001,tt0201290,11012,31,"The most offensive thing about ""The Underground Comedy Movie"" is it's not funny!"
9002,tt0201290,11012,32,What the writers and directors don't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn't work.
9003,tt0201290,11012,33,There has to be more!
9004,tt0201290,11012,34,"Just think of the famous scene from ""There's Something About Mary"" ironically, enough the bozo filmmakers put the Farrellys on their special thanks list."
9005,tt0201290,11012,35,The joke about the semen wasn't just funny because it involved bodily fluids.
9006,tt0201290,11012,36,There was a buildup.
9007,tt0201290,11012,37,"Ben Stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn't go out on a date with a ""loaded gun."""
9008,tt0201290,11012,38,Then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released.
9009,tt0201290,11012,39,"A knock is on the door, and he has to answer it."
9010,tt0201290,11012,40,"His date, Mary, is at the door and that's when it's revealed that the semen is hanging off Ben's ear."
9011,tt0201290,11012,41,"In this movie, there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people, with no buildup whatsoever."
9012,tt0201290,11012,42,"As Jay Leno always says, ""This comedy thing's not so easy, is it."""
9013,tt0201290,11012,43,"Keep that in mind, Vince Offer, 'cause you weren't cut out for this genre!!"
9014,tt0201290,11012,44,The only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip.
9015,tt0201290,11012,45,"Let's face it, nowadays it's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect."
9016,tt0201290,11012,46,"I know comedy is subjective...but this movie shouldn't be funny to anybody, except maybe the filmmakers themselves."
9017,tt0201290,11012,47,"As a side note, the movie had to have been made before Michael Clarke Duncan's fame in movies like ""Armageddon"" and ""The Green Mile."""
9018,tt0201290,11012,48,There can't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show.
9019,tt0201290,11012,49,"All the others in the cast are either non actors, has been actors or B movie stars."
9020,tt0201290,11012,50,"Karen Black made a good impression in ""Five Easy Pieces,"" but I don't think she's done anything of value ever since."
9021,tt0201290,11012,51,Slash was probably drugged into being in this film.
9022,tt0201290,11012,52,"Gina Lee Nolin is nothing without ""Baywatch."""
9023,tt0201290,11012,53,"Angelyne is the film's biggest star keeping in mind Duncan wasn't famous at the time, and there are still probably a ton of people who haven't heard of her for good reason."
9024,tt0201290,11012,54,"Usually, I'm in support of extremely low budget flicks, but this one deserves to drift into obscurity."
9025,tt0201290,11012,55,I hope to Lord this doesn't become a cult classic!
9026,tt0201290,11012,56,Shouldn't there be a law against distributing crap like this.
9027,tt0201290,11013,1,I'm into bad movies but this has NOTHING going for it.
9028,tt0201290,11013,2,"Despite what the morons above have said, it is NOT funny."
9029,tt0201290,11013,3,I know comedy AND underground movies but this is so boring that the Director / Writer should be prohibited from EVER directing anything but local cable access EVER again!
9030,tt0201290,11013,4,To love movies and comedy is to despise this film.
9031,tt0201290,11013,5,I may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was.
9032,tt0201290,11013,6,If you like this movie you ARE a pothead as sober there is NOTHING here.
9033,tt0201290,11013,7,ZERO!
9034,tt0201290,11013,8,"If you need to compare underground movies, see ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" or early John Waters."
9035,tt0201290,11013,9,The movie starts by defining satire and I defy anyone to show me the satire.
9036,tt0201290,11013,10,The rule for comedy is THIS ...
9037,tt0201290,11013,11,"If it's FUNNY you can say or do ANYTHING but if it's NOT funny you are not satirical, you are not edgy, you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny."
9038,tt0201290,11013,12,ZERO!
9039,tt0201290,11014,1,This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.
9040,tt0201290,11014,2,"This is saying quite a bit, considering some of the choices I've made in film rentals."
9041,tt0201290,11014,3,I got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone I went to high school with is topless in it.
9042,tt0201290,11014,4,The topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to Roseanne sing Big Spender.
9043,tt0201290,11014,5,"The ""skits"" are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker room gags, and it's such a blatant and poor rip off of The Kentucky Fried Movie that you'll be begging for Big Jim Slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of ""Vince Offer"" whoever that is."
9044,tt0201290,11014,6,"Unless you are a masochist, avoid this pile of rubbish."
9045,tt0201290,11015,1,"I foolishly read the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy about a year ago, and said to myself, ""Seems funny, plus it has Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!"""
9046,tt0201290,11015,2,I proceeded to pay $15.99 plus tax for it.
9047,tt0201290,11015,3,I took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted.
9048,tt0201290,11015,4,Wooden performances abound.
9049,tt0201290,11015,5,"All the ""hilarious"" and ""outstanding"" performances promised never seemed to arrive."
9050,tt0201290,11015,6,"After 90 minutes I hung my head in shame, knowing that I could never get that 90 minutes or $15.99 back."
9051,tt0201290,11015,7,"I literally almost cried as well, because if that was what could be considered ""comedy"" I didn't want to believe in movies anymore."
9052,tt0201290,11015,8,My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was.
9053,tt0201290,11015,9,Over the holiday season this year I watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone.
9054,tt0201290,11015,10,"This was my next horrible mistake, because as I watched I just became angry."
9055,tt0201290,11015,11,"I began to yell at the movie, and I'm not one to talk to movies period."
9056,tt0201290,11015,12,Everyone I know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen.
9057,tt0201290,11015,13,"My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that could not save this movie even."
9058,tt0201290,11015,14,The fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on IMDb is astounding.
9059,tt0201290,11015,15,The fact that its rating at the time of this writing is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
9060,tt0201290,11016,1,Imagine the worst skits from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90 minute movie.
9061,tt0201290,11016,2,"Now, imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity."
9062,tt0201290,11016,3,Now imagine something 50 times worse.
9063,tt0201290,11016,4,Got that.
9064,tt0201290,11016,5,"OK, now go see The Underground Comedy Movie."
9065,tt0201290,11016,6,That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever.
9066,tt0201290,11016,7,UCM is the single worst movie I've ever seen.
9067,tt0201290,11016,8,There were a few cheap laughs...very few.
9068,tt0201290,11016,9,But it was lame.
9069,tt0201290,11016,10,"Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame, it was too lame to be funny."
9070,tt0201290,11016,11,The only reason I'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else I know bought it.
9071,tt0201290,11016,12,He wasted his money.
9072,tt0201290,11016,13,Vince Offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's no surprise why.
9073,tt0247804,1234,1,"Well, it turned out as I expected: visual overload but nothing else added to the original."
9074,tt0247804,1234,2,What did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick.
9075,tt0247804,1234,3,"Initially this awoke my interest, but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns a were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical Hollywood like product and b made the whole storyline improbable!"
9076,tt0247804,1234,4,"The 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward, and included no time storms or any bogus of that sort: it just stated that when you come home after a long journey, things might have changed a bit."
9077,tt0247804,1234,5,"Earth might have fallen in the hands of apes, for example."
9078,tt0247804,1234,6,"Like many 'old' movies, it's main ingredient was suspense hell, does anyone understand that word these days.."
9079,tt0247804,1234,7,"In this Burton movie, an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie, but at what cost."
9080,tt0247804,1234,8,"Surely, the images are overwhelming, and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape culture even ape music!, but what's wrong."
9081,tt0247804,1234,9,"First, the suspension of disbelief is made very hard, because the apes have a lot of Hollywood human traits."
9082,tt0247804,1234,10,I refer especially to Ari and the slave trader.
9083,tt0247804,1234,11,"These traits include emotional skills like irony, sarcasm, and an overtly displayed array of 'subtle' emotions."
9084,tt0247804,1234,12,"It makes you forget that the apes are apes, which is essential."
9085,tt0247804,1234,13,"Second, the humans TALK."
9086,tt0247804,1234,14,"Of course, we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak, but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didn't made the ape/human role switching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version."
9087,tt0247804,1234,15,The wound in the throat that Charlton Heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that Dr.
9088,tt0247804,1234,16,"Zira has in him so, no need for things like human rights activists or ape human love in order to explain things."
9089,tt0247804,1234,17,"Third, the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility, but is a necessary twist in the new movie, since Capt."
9090,tt0247804,1234,18,Davidson has to play the Hollywood let's save the whole world and have a good ending for everyone and still make it to the lounge bar for a cool diet coke character.
9091,tt0247804,1234,19,"Oh my god, will they never learn."
9092,tt0247804,1234,20,"I new it from the start, when there was only one guy who got lost!"
9093,tt0247804,1234,21,They were in need of a hero!
9094,tt0247804,1234,22,"And then the script writers go on reasoning: we need one guy... so, why would one guy get lost... because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm... implausible!"
9095,tt0247804,1234,23,But it's necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes!
9096,tt0247804,1234,24,"Since, in these modern and politically correct times, we can't have a xenophobic ape hater like Charlton Heston's 68 character loose on the screen: let's give them a bubblegum version!"
9097,tt0247804,1234,25,"Fourth, okay, the general twist of the original 'discovering the truth' of the 1968 film to the modern version he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab apes developed their society, where Heston simply discovered that just, somehow, the apes overtook the earth while he was away is nicely done."
9098,tt0247804,1234,26,"The second, battle part comes as an anti climax."
9099,tt0247804,1234,27,That's because this movie has added the first two Planet Of The Apes movies in one plot.
9100,tt0247804,1234,28,"Nice try, but the chill you feel when Davidson and you discover that he's lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battle part."
9101,tt0247804,1234,29,Fifth: the ending!!!
9102,tt0247804,1234,30,"For chrissakes, who came up with that.!"
9103,tt0247804,1234,31,"a Davidson crashes TWICE with his escape pod, which seems an unsteerable object, while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully."
9104,tt0247804,1234,32,"Come on, who'd believe that."
9105,tt0247804,1234,33,"If the pods are really small space crafts Davidson simply flies off into space at the end and not merely escape vessels, he might have managed a safe landing at least once, no."
9106,tt0247804,1234,34,And what about that ending....
9107,tt0247804,1234,35,"I mean, in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth."
9108,tt0247804,1234,36,"But here: the whole movie takes place on a distant planet, and suddenly the same there's a Thade statue ape culture is on earth..."
9109,tt0247804,1234,37,How come.
9110,tt0247804,1234,38,"Did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically, flew into the time storm and colonised earth before Davidson's mission took off."
9111,tt0247804,1234,39,Why is Thade worshiped.
9112,tt0247804,1234,40,Stupid stupid stupid.
9113,tt0247804,1234,41,"Helena Bonham Carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape, but I'd expected no less."
9114,tt0247804,1234,42,"I preferred her ape above Estella Warren as a human, but maybe I got some loose wire in my head."
9115,tt0247804,1234,43,"Nevertheless, the only convincing apes were Tim Roth as Thade wonderful!"
9116,tt0247804,1234,44,"and Ari's household ape the ex general, but I forgot his name."
9117,tt0247804,1234,45,"Nonono, a lot of things could and should have been added/altered to the 1968 pic, but not the plot, at least not in that way."
9118,tt0247804,1234,46,It was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining.
9119,tt0247804,1234,47,It was nicely tongue in cheek and caricatured.
9120,tt0247804,1234,48,Don't stylize everything...
9121,tt0247804,1235,1,"I really looked forward to see Planet of the Apes, but it was a huge dissapointment."
9122,tt0247804,1235,2,"The settings and masks are great, but that is the only good aspect of the film."
9123,tt0247804,1235,3,All other things are really annoying.
9124,tt0247804,1235,4,"Mark Wahlberg is not acting, he is just in the movie, looking stupid."
9125,tt0247804,1235,5,The other actors are also not very good.
9126,tt0247804,1235,6,"But the worst point of all, is the story."
9127,tt0247804,1235,7,It is absolutely ridiculous!
9128,tt0247804,1235,8,"For example: the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground, but the humans don`t attack them, no, they wait until they are up again!"
9129,tt0247804,1235,9,"This is just one example for the stupid story, but it would take too long to tell them all."
9130,tt0247804,1236,1,What ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time.
9131,tt0247804,1236,2,"Well, he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could've been directed by anybody available out of film school...and in fact, they probably would've done a better job."
9132,tt0247804,1236,3,They would've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script.
9133,tt0247804,1236,4,Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes. gasp!
9134,tt0247804,1236,5,"Except this time around, the apes squirm through groan worthy dialogue, nonsensical plotting, and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe."
9135,tt0247804,1236,6,"As much as I enjoy the superb acting talent that is Tim Roth, his performance as evil ape leader Thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing."
9136,tt0247804,1236,7,"Luckily for him, the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles."
9137,tt0247804,1236,8,"And alas, the always dependable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause."
9138,tt0247804,1236,9,"And the ""haha, we're so clever, aren't we."" way that Hollywood intermingles references from the original POTA into this one."
9139,tt0247804,1236,10,Sigh...
9140,tt0247804,1236,11,"Instead of seeing this, spend the night in and call up some friends and rent 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Batman', or even to a lesser extent 'Sleepy Hollow', and reminisce about the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality...not shame and ridicule."
9141,tt0247804,1237,1,"I had VERY low expectations for this alleged ""re imagining"" of the original and they weren't even met!"
9142,tt0247804,1237,2,What were they thinking.
9143,tt0247804,1237,3,Answer: They weren't.
9144,tt0247804,1237,4,Please don't waste your time on this Hollywood trash fest.
9145,tt0247804,1237,5,"Clip your nails, balance your checkbook, do anything besides watch this."
9146,tt0247804,1237,6,"Remember: If you rent stuff like this, it will only ensure they make more."
9147,tt0247804,1238,1,"This Tim Burton remake of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" from 1968 and starring Charleton Heston is a far, far cry from the quality and plot of the original."
9148,tt0247804,1238,2,"Certainly special effects have improved since 1968, but writing has not."
9149,tt0247804,1238,3,The characters were boring and the dialog was awful.
9150,tt0247804,1238,4,"I sat through the entire film with a friend who thankfully only rented it and completely understood why, before Christmas, all of the ""Planet of the Apes"" toys at Target were in the clearance bin."
9151,tt0247804,1238,5,My advice to Tim Burton: don't put this on your resume.
9152,tt0247804,1238,6,"My advice to everyone else: watch the original 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"" movie."
9153,tt0247804,1239,1,"Being a big fan of the ""other"" PLANET OF THE APES films, I rented this DVD despite my aversion to all things Tim Burton."
9154,tt0247804,1239,2,"Once again, he doesn't fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction."
9155,tt0247804,1239,3,"Even the ape makeup looks second rate, which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity."
9156,tt0247804,1239,4,Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor as if BOOGIE NIGHTS wasn't proof enough.
9157,tt0247804,1239,5,I was embarrassed for genuine talents such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter.
9158,tt0247804,1239,6,No doubt their paychecks motivated them since it couldn't possibly have been the cliche ridden screenplay.
9159,tt0247804,1239,7,I rented this DVD on a special $1 night and I still feel ripped off.
9160,tt0247804,1240,1,I think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci fi flick.
9161,tt0247804,1240,2,"For one thing, it was directed by Tim Burton."
9162,tt0247804,1240,3,"Another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic."
9163,tt0247804,1240,4,"I found it boring, gross, and ridiculous."
9164,tt0247804,1240,5,"If you've seen it, you know what I mean."
9165,tt0247804,1240,6,"Just about everyone at Imdb say it's crap and boy, are they right!"
9166,tt0247804,1240,7,"If you haven't, avoid it."
9167,tt0247804,1240,8,It's a snorer. 1 out of 10.
9168,tt0247804,1241,1,This is the worst movie I have seen for years!
9169,tt0247804,1241,2,It starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way.
9170,tt0247804,1241,3,"I thnik when is something going to happen in this film,,,, and the the acting is worse."
9171,tt0247804,1241,4,The ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop.
9172,tt0247804,1241,5,Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie.
9173,tt0247804,1241,6,Sorry Tim Burton Batman was good but this one sucks.
9174,tt0247804,1242,1,while watching this piece of crap!
9175,tt0247804,1242,2,"The Day after, I saw a 1min Trailer that one minute included all, ALL what was at least not boring to watch...so don't waste money or time on this one, get the original, it's much better though the effects might not be up to date..."
9176,tt0247804,1243,1,"This movie was 100% boring, i swear i almost died from boredom at the theater."
9177,tt0247804,1243,2,"It wasnt funny and didnt really hve that much action in it either, it was BORING and i hope whoever out there that liked this movie, god be with you in the future when you find out what this movie was really like and try to jump off a bridge or something like that"
9178,tt0247804,1244,1,"This is a bit of a first for me, the first time I have ever been disappointed in a Tim Burton film."
9179,tt0247804,1244,2,"POTA isn't a bad film great sets, costumes and the odd great performance but it could have been made by any off the shelf hollywood director."
9180,tt0247804,1244,3,"The pacing was very odd, the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end, by myself and the cast."
9181,tt0247804,1244,4,"Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the film."
9182,tt0247804,1244,5,Come back Tim.
9183,tt0247804,1245,1,"Absolutely the worst film yet by Burton, who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs."
9184,tt0247804,1245,2,A miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film.
9185,tt0247804,1245,3,"This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shout out ""he's lost his gun!"""
9186,tt0247804,1245,4,or whatever it is to let everybody know.
9187,tt0247804,1245,5,"Carter is really awful and so is Wahlberg, who can't play this straight and be convincing."
9188,tt0247804,1245,6,"Very nice effects and photography, but poor music in the John Williams mold by Burton's crony Elfman."
9189,tt0247804,1245,7,Heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch phrases from the first movie.
9190,tt0247804,1245,8,Very poor results.
9191,tt0247804,1245,9,"If anyone else out there also saw ""Sleepy Hollow"", they will probably have noticed, as I have, the declining quality of Burton's films."
9192,tt0247804,1245,10,"I've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was brought in as director, in which case his judgement should be questioned."
9193,tt0247804,1245,11,But I think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; the evidence is there in the films.
9194,tt0247804,1245,12,"In ""Sleepy Hollow"", he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of british character actors Chris Lee, etc. made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film those are never scary, as horror fans know."
9195,tt0247804,1245,13,"The movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to smooth the two together."
9196,tt0247804,1245,14,"""Planet of the Apes"" is much the same way, and the result comes off more like ""Total Recall"" or ""Tango and Cash"" than like sci fi."
9197,tt0247804,1245,15,"He's also fallen into the rut of so many other ""big"" directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience."
9198,tt0247804,1245,16,"Word to Burton, if you're out there pick something and do it straight, or use some style to peice it all together as in ""Mars Attacks"" or ""Beetlejuice"" or you might as well retire, because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going."
9199,tt0247804,1246,1,Spoilers I guess.
9200,tt0247804,1246,2,The absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie.
9201,tt0247804,1246,3,I just couldn't get over it.
9202,tt0247804,1246,4,And what is wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character.
9203,tt0247804,1246,5,"If I suddenly found myself crashed landed on a planet full of talking apes, I'd be all like, "" AAAAhhhhHHH!!!"
9204,tt0247804,1246,6,Run for your lives!
9205,tt0247804,1246,7,"The monkeys have inherited the Earth!"""
9206,tt0247804,1246,8,"But he's all like, ""talking apes, okay."
9207,tt0247804,1246,9,"Next."""
9208,tt0247804,1246,10,That's pretty jaded I'd say.
9209,tt0247804,1246,11,He must run into even stranger things on a regular basis.
9210,tt0247804,1246,12,"Besides that, this is Rick Baker's best work yet."
9211,tt0247804,1246,13,This film is a true testament to how far we've come in the monkey makeup field.
9212,tt0247804,1246,14,3/10.
9213,tt0247804,1247,1,Not good!
9214,tt0247804,1247,2,Rent or buy the original!
9215,tt0247804,1247,3,Watch this only if someone has a gun to your head and then....maybe.
9216,tt0247804,1247,4,It is like claiming an Elvis actor is as good as the real King.
9217,tt0247804,1248,1,This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it.
9218,tt0247804,1248,2,"It was sort of a remake but then again, not really."
9219,tt0247804,1248,3,I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal.
9220,tt0247804,1248,4,He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money $100 million but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million.
9221,tt0247804,1248,5,Heck no.
9222,tt0247804,1248,6,"So in that regard, the film fails."
9223,tt0247804,1248,7,"At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming."
9224,tt0247804,1248,8,"And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about."
9225,tt0247804,1248,9,I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.
9226,tt0247804,1248,10,"This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes""."
9227,tt0247804,1248,11,"Here's how I would have written it:An astronaut it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans not mutes, a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it."
9228,tt0247804,1248,12,But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film.
9229,tt0247804,1248,13,"Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing."
9230,tt0247804,1248,14,Consider what he did with the Batman series.
9231,tt0247804,1248,15,He's a rotten director inspite what of people think.
9232,tt0247804,1248,16,He's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking.
9233,tt0247804,1248,17,"Sorry, but no."
9234,tt0247804,1248,18,"If anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying."
9235,tt0247804,1249,1,"What a disappointment, especially in light of the budget provided, the technical resources available, and the talent assembled."
9236,tt0247804,1249,2,Isn't the fundamental rule for science fiction/drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief.
9237,tt0247804,1249,3,"POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning, suckering us in, but thereinafter Mr."
9238,tt0247804,1249,4,Burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains.
9239,tt0247804,1249,5,"The over the top libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter's chimp, the worthlessness of the humans' lockup, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary skills of horsemanship this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt, the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable."
9240,tt0247804,1249,6,"Mark Wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down."
9241,tt0247804,1249,7,"Compare to the original, in which Chuck Heston's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events."
9242,tt0247804,1249,8,"The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation, and we never really wonder about his well being."
9243,tt0247804,1249,9,"Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in real jeopardy."
9244,tt0247804,1249,10,Tim Burton should have used some of the f/x budget for some competent screenwriting.
9245,tt0247804,1249,11,"In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats."
9246,tt0247804,1249,12,Let them walk.
9247,tt0247804,1249,13,Trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in Planet of the Apes 2001.
9248,tt0247804,1249,14,I'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent.
9249,tt0247804,1249,15,"It could have been a new franchise, and a wonderful new step for imagination."
9250,tt0247804,1249,16,Another opportunity lost.
9251,tt0247804,1250,1,"I have to admit that this ""re imagining"" of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment."
9252,tt0247804,1250,2,Specially when taken into consideration that this is a Tim Burton film.
9253,tt0247804,1250,3,"He is defenetly one of the most original and, might I say, cool directors Hollywood has produced."
9254,tt0247804,1250,4,"I am personally a great fan of his work, but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick, The Planet of the Apes."
9255,tt0247804,1250,5,I really enjoyed the original film.
9256,tt0247804,1250,6,"When it first came out people expected just another cheezie 70's science fiction film, but a very surprise anding totally proved that theory wrong."
9257,tt0247804,1250,7,It had indeed a clear cut message.
9258,tt0247804,1250,8,An obvious anti war message.
9259,tt0247804,1250,9,"Fear of the cold war, where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the film makers."
9260,tt0247804,1250,10,Those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic.
9261,tt0247804,1250,11,"Although, the new film, the ""re making"" or whatever, leaves us with nothing."
9262,tt0247804,1250,12,"No message, no ideals behind it."
9263,tt0247804,1250,13,It is just another money minded summer blockbuster.
9264,tt0247804,1250,14,Visually Tim Burton does not let you down.
9265,tt0247804,1250,15,The dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrific.
9266,tt0247804,1250,16,Obviously that is not enough to keep people intrested in a film.
9267,tt0247804,1250,17,There has to be an exciting plot or storyline.
9268,tt0247804,1250,18,In this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out.
9269,tt0247804,1250,19,The script is very lame and it is full of gaps.
9270,tt0247804,1250,20,It looks like this film had been written in a big hurry.
9271,tt0247804,1250,21,"The explanation for why the apes where there, and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the script writers ignorance."
9272,tt0247804,1250,22,"It raised a lot of questions, which had no reasonable answers to."
9273,tt0247804,1250,23,"For example; Why did the apes speak English., why were there other ape species than chimps on the planet given that there were only chimps in the space ship that crash landed on the planet Where the hell did all of those humans come from."
9274,tt0247804,1250,24,How were a few chimps able to evolve into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years.
9275,tt0247804,1250,25,I mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man!
9276,tt0247804,1250,26,"And finally, the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb."
9277,tt0247804,1250,27,"It was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end, then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending."
9278,tt0247804,1250,28,"The ending also raises a lot of questions, which I KNOW, don¬¥t have intelligent answears."
9279,tt0247804,1250,29,"Did Theid learn to work the space ship., which was power less, and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand., and, what did he do, breed with all the women."
9280,tt0247804,1250,30,"And lets say that that would happen, I higly doubt that history would stay the same, like Washington would be built exactly like it is today!"
9281,tt0247804,1250,31,I mean wouln't there be a huge banana instead of the memorial.
9282,tt0247804,1250,32,"Well, just to say something posative about the film."
9283,tt0247804,1250,33,Some of the cast was great.
9284,tt0247804,1250,34,"Helen Bonham Carter's character was interesting and well acted, as for Tim Roth as Theid."
9285,tt0247804,1250,35,"He was very good, a little exaturated at some points of the film."
9286,tt0247804,1250,36,Michael Clark Duncan was also fine.
9287,tt0247804,1250,37,I was not happy with Marc Whalberg.
9288,tt0247804,1250,38,"He is not much of an actor, and plays here a very macho colour less character."
9289,tt0247804,1250,39,Very unbielevable and is nothing compared to Hestons character in the original.
9290,tt0247804,1250,40,And the main female character had no reason or place in the film.
9291,tt0247804,1250,41,She was just casted for the looks.
9292,tt0247804,1250,42,Hardly said a word throughout the entire film.
9293,tt0247804,1250,43,"Well, I think that in the future when people think about the Planet of the apes, they will think about the original one."
9294,tt0247804,1250,44,The latest will soon be forgotten.
9295,tt0247804,1251,1,"Apart from Helen Bonham Carter, there is nothing worthy about this movie...."
9296,tt0247804,1251,2,And the surprise ending.!
9297,tt0247804,1251,3,The thought of a sequel is even more annoying.
9298,tt0247804,1251,4,"Save your money, wait for the video and ignore that too."
9299,tt0247804,1252,1,"After looking at monkeys oops apes for more than one hour, I was feeling like one too."
9300,tt0247804,1252,2,"I was an ape, spending money on this movie."
9301,tt0247804,1252,3,"Please people, hold you money in your pocket and go see some funny movie like Bridget Jones's Diary.."
9302,tt0247804,1253,1,I read somewhere that Hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leave the classics alone.
9303,tt0247804,1253,2,We can only hope.
9304,tt0247804,1253,3,"While this remake wasn't a total waste, I still wish I had the six bucks back to go toward a DVD of the original."
9305,tt0247804,1253,4,Lots of violence and one of the worst endings I've ever seen.
9306,tt0247804,1253,5,This version doesn't add anything new.
9307,tt0247804,1253,6,It only reiterates why Hollywood should leave the good stuff alone.
9308,tt0247804,1254,1,"I have seen and liked the original film, and expected more from a remake than this."
9309,tt0247804,1254,2,GOOD: Effects and makeup are good.
9310,tt0247804,1254,3,"No complaints about the score and visuals, they are adequate, and the performances were okay Tim Roth was excellent, the other principals were fine, and a handful of the ""supporting supporting actors"" did very well with extremely limited roles."
9311,tt0247804,1254,4,The action scenes were exciting and fun.
9312,tt0247804,1254,5,BAD: The escape from the ape city was terrible.
9313,tt0247804,1254,6,"The characters are going in circles, then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape."
9314,tt0247804,1254,7,"Plus, what escape route leads through everybody's bedroom."
9315,tt0247804,1254,8,The story was pared down to include as much action as possible.
9316,tt0247804,1254,9,I like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect.
9317,tt0247804,1254,10,"Finally, the ending was completely nonsensical as presented."
9318,tt0247804,1254,11,"Without seeing the inevitable sequel, there is no justification for it."
9319,tt0247804,1255,1,"The acting was bad, the script was bad and the ending was just terrible...the only good comment i could make about this movie would be the special effects and make up...but apart from that...this movie would be one of the worst movies of 2001...why on earth did they have to remake such a perfect movie and ruin it...why!!!!"
9320,tt0247804,1256,1,This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his `vision' to the screen.
9321,tt0247804,1256,2,"He has done it with `Batman', `Sleepy Hollow' and now this."
9322,tt0247804,1256,3,This is not a remake.
9323,tt0247804,1256,4,The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak and Charleton Heston makes a cameo.
9324,tt0247804,1256,5,"Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership."
9325,tt0247804,1256,6,The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time.
9326,tt0247804,1256,7,During the 1960's America was struggling to redefine its civilization.
9327,tt0247804,1256,8,It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms.
9328,tt0247804,1256,9,It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal.
9329,tt0247804,1256,10,"In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day."
9330,tt0247804,1256,11,POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior.
9331,tt0247804,1256,12,"The dialectic between Colonel Taylor Charleton Heston, Dr."
9332,tt0247804,1256,13,Cornelius Roddy McDowall and Dr.
9333,tt0247804,1256,14,Zira Kim Hunter was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.
9334,tt0247804,1256,15,Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties.
9335,tt0247804,1256,16,This is Apes for Dummies.
9336,tt0247804,1256,17,"It is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance."
9337,tt0247804,1256,18,The `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel.
9338,tt0247804,1256,19,"While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `I know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'"
9339,tt0247804,1256,20,"From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent."
9340,tt0247804,1256,21,The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding though I continue to dislike his dark look.
9341,tt0247804,1256,22,"However, thirty three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script."
9342,tt0247804,1256,23,The story has been reduced to a monster movie.
9343,tt0247804,1256,24,"The humans band together behind Captain Davidson Mark Wahlberg to fight the monstrous Apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoats notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari."
9344,tt0247804,1256,25,"The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality."
9345,tt0247804,1256,26,The acting is mixed.
9346,tt0247804,1256,27,Mark Wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role.
9347,tt0247804,1256,28,"Walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong."
9348,tt0247804,1256,29,"This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire."
9349,tt0247804,1256,30,Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable.
9350,tt0247804,1256,31,"She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager."
9351,tt0247804,1256,32,Then there is Tim Roth.
9352,tt0247804,1256,33,"His is a virtuoso performance, single handedly saving the film from total ruin."
9353,tt0247804,1256,34,Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade.
9354,tt0247804,1256,35,He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time.
9355,tt0247804,1256,36,"Additionally, his physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists."
9356,tt0247804,1256,37,This film is a great disappointment.
9357,tt0247804,1256,38,"It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door."
9358,tt0247804,1256,39,I rated it a 3/10.
9359,tt0247804,1256,40,"From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 9/10."
9360,tt0247804,1256,41,However the story is an insult to the original franchise.
9361,tt0247804,1256,42,"It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is."
9362,tt0247804,1256,43,"Of course it's true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption."
9363,tt0247804,1257,1,"If there's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film, it's seeing it done by experienced film makers who ought to know better."
9364,tt0247804,1257,2,"This ""re imagining"" of Planet of the Apes could have used some imagination, to say nothing of essential elements of character development."
9365,tt0247804,1257,3,"Nova, the girl in the original Planet of the Apes, was a better developed character than Daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word."
9366,tt0247804,1257,4,"One certainly expected a lot better from Tim Burton, a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humour, all of which were notably absent from this production."
9367,tt0247804,1257,5,There were problems in basic plot development.
9368,tt0247804,1257,6,The first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk.
9369,tt0247804,1257,7,This was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made all the difference in the original film.
9370,tt0247804,1257,8,"Even while he was mute, his ability to communicate was what marked out Heston's Taylor as being different from the other humans."
9371,tt0247804,1257,9,"In the current film, Mark Wahlberg encourages the talking human slaves to revolt, but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already."
9372,tt0247804,1257,10,"They are dexterous tool users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans, something mute humans can't do."
9373,tt0247804,1257,11,It needs no man to fall from the stars to save them.
9374,tt0247804,1257,12,"Indeed, since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre technology era without at first any gadgets to help him, it is Wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage, not the humans who are used to living there."
9375,tt0247804,1257,13,It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall Mark Wahlberg.
9376,tt0247804,1257,14,Her best scenes were with the villainous Tim Roth.
9377,tt0247804,1257,15,"The humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, at which point Daena started showing some actual interest in Davidson Wahlberg, and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung ho freedom fighter."
9378,tt0247804,1257,16,This was poor character development.
9379,tt0247804,1257,17,"Estella Warren, in particular, looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script."
9380,tt0247804,1257,18,"Wahlberg's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me, as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout."
9381,tt0247804,1257,19,"Creating the apes: half a plus point and two minuses: Ape make up was excellent on the males, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes which was why he was so good in The Green Mile, and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully."
9382,tt0247804,1257,20,"But the ape females looked like nothing on earth, neither ape nor human."
9383,tt0247804,1257,21,"The minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as Flash Gordon's rocket: jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a catapult, they had none of the long limbed grace of genuine apes."
9384,tt0247804,1257,22,"Secondly, the poor sound mixing when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal, probably feline, making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic."
9385,tt0247804,1257,23,"In the original film, the various ""human"" things the apes do and say are handled as light relief ""I never knew an ape I didn't like."""
9386,tt0247804,1257,24,"""Human see, human do!""."
9387,tt0247804,1257,25,"Here, the apes just talk matter of factly exactly as 21st Century humans do, and there is no humour in it at all."
9388,tt0247804,1257,26,The only genuinely original idea was Ari writing with her feet.
9389,tt0247804,1257,27,"Nothing made me cringe more than the ""V Ger from Star Trek"" moment near the end of the film."
9390,tt0247804,1257,28,"First of all, the apes had apparently been able to read Roman lettering in the distant past, for them to know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partly concealed form."
9391,tt0247804,1257,29,"Secondly, the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which Wahlberg just brushes away, something any ape could have done centuries ago."
9392,tt0247804,1257,30,"This moment was, for me, far worse than the much maligned ending of the movie."
9393,tt0247804,1257,31,"Things of that nature, however, are typical of most science fiction movies of today."
9394,tt0247804,1257,32,"Back in the '60s and '70s, they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets, but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional."
9395,tt0247804,1257,33,"I'm thinking of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 1967 Planet of the Apes, THX1138, Soylent Green, Silent Running and the 1972 Solaris."
9396,tt0247804,1257,34,The first Planet of the Apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time.
9397,tt0247804,1257,35,"However, this film includes just about every bad science fiction clich√© going: space storms, anomalies and worm holes straight out of Star Trek; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes in reality from any one planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points of light; a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from Saturn to Earth in a matter of minutes instead of years; two thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button."
9398,tt0247804,1257,36,To say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door.
9399,tt0247804,1257,37,"In a contemporary setting, you'd have to explain why it was bullet proof, but because it's ""science fiction"" you don't have to!"
9400,tt0247804,1257,38,"Overall, Burton's most disappointing film."
9401,tt0247804,1258,1,Warning: Spoilers Galore!
9402,tt0247804,1258,2,"Tim Burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking Psycho oh, that's right, some idiot already did that I rest my case."
9403,tt0247804,1258,3,"Movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation, proving he's not that smart from the outset."
9404,tt0247804,1258,4,"Marky Mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing, then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees."
9405,tt0247804,1258,5,"The perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting Saturn for no apparent reason, interior of ship a bustle with genetic experiments on apes."
9406,tt0247804,1258,6,"Must we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments."
9407,tt0247804,1258,7,The special effects team decrees it.
9408,tt0247804,1258,8,Marky's chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s sci fi cinema the Time Warp.
9409,tt0247804,1258,9,"Marky then demonstrates the space station's mind boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep space rescue mission into a worm hole for an expendable test chimp, with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies."
9410,tt0247804,1258,10,"Before anyone can say `Pointless Remake' Marky has surfed the worm hole, crashed on an alien planet, removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest, if it weren't for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees."
9411,tt0247804,1258,11,Surprise!
9412,tt0247804,1258,12,"It's APES doing the chasing or at least, it would have been a surprise if no one saw Planet Of The Apes THIRTY THREE YEARS AGO.Since Marky Mark did not get to show his pecs, take down his pants, or bust his lame whiteboy rap, he was characterless."
9413,tt0247804,1258,13,Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing his lack of character.
9414,tt0247804,1258,14,"Helena Bonham Carter aka irritating chimp activist, at a loss without a Shakespearean script, did a fine job of outdoing both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutout."
9415,tt0247804,1258,15,"Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz."
9416,tt0247804,1258,16,"Though I have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie, one review headline captured the essence of this Planet Of The Apes `re imagining': `The Apes Of Roth'."
9417,tt0247804,1258,17,"While everyone else minced about looking like extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, as Chimpanzee Thade, chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously."
9418,tt0247804,1258,18,"As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc: Thade is mad when we first meet him... and he's pretty much at the same level of mad at film's end."
9419,tt0247804,1258,19,Nice twist.
9420,tt0247804,1258,20,"The original POTA 1968 featured a leading character, Charlton Heston's Taylor, who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets yet as that film progressed, Taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind's worth as their sole champion!"
9421,tt0247804,1258,21,"The original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had NOT prevailed."
9422,tt0247804,1258,22,Is there anything that cerebral or ironic to Marky Mark's Leo.
9423,tt0247804,1258,23,Or Roth's Thade.
9424,tt0247804,1258,24,"No, but there's lots of running."
9425,tt0247804,1258,25,The slogans cry: Take Back The Planet .but it's the APES' planet.
9426,tt0247804,1258,26,"In this movie, humans and apes crash landed here together, the humans having degenerated to cavepeople, allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor; the apes DESERVED to inherit the planet!"
9427,tt0247804,1258,27,"Along comes Marky Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, taking it for granted that humans HAVE to be the apex predators, simply because they're there."
9428,tt0247804,1258,28,"`Taking it back' is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001, complaining, `A planet where men evolved from APES..!!'"
9429,tt0247804,1258,29,and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses.
9430,tt0247804,1258,30,"Heston was cast in the 1968 POTA because he had established his reputation as a maverick: he WAS Ben Hur, Michelangelo, Moses!"
9431,tt0247804,1258,31,"To cast him as the mute, dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience's expectations: how crazed must a world be where Our Man Charlton cannot command respect."
9432,tt0247804,1258,32,Marky Mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants.
9433,tt0247804,1258,33,"Though Heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting."
9434,tt0247804,1258,34,"When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans, it's like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor, who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him."
9435,tt0247804,1258,35,"Burton tries to elevate Marky to humanity's icon, but he comes off as a chittering deviant."
9436,tt0247804,1258,36,"In the original film, the apes deem Taylor a deviant, yet he was, to audience and apes alike, an icon of humanity."
9437,tt0247804,1258,37,That irony again.
9438,tt0247804,1258,38,"It was apt that a man who elevated scene chewing to an acting technique Heston should play the father of this film's primo scene chewer, Thaddeus Roth."
9439,tt0247804,1258,39,"As Roth's ape dad, Charlton utters his own immortal lines, turned against the HUMANS this time, `Damn them!"
9440,tt0247804,1258,40,Damn them all to hell!'
9441,tt0247804,1258,41,The movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end.
9442,tt0247804,1258,42,"While Thaddeus is giving Marky an ass beating lesson, a pod descends from on high with Marky's chimpnaut in it."
9443,tt0247804,1258,43,"Apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature, while Marky proves his own hebetude by muttering, `Let's teach these monkeys about evolution.'"
9444,tt0247804,1258,44,"Firstly, they're not monkeys, you ape!"
9445,tt0247804,1258,45,"Secondly, it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point, not evolution."
9446,tt0247804,1258,46,"And what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution."
9447,tt0247804,1258,47,Giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that Estella Warren's half nekkid role was actually integral to the plot be still my pants..
9448,tt0247804,1258,48,"No matter that he was humankind's last underpanted hope; in the end, cop apes take Marky away to Plot Point Prison where he was last heard ululating, `It's a madhouse!"
9449,tt0247804,1258,49,A MADHOUSE!!...'
9450,tt0247804,1259,1,Thank you Hollywood.
9451,tt0247804,1259,2,"Yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect heavy and redundant remake."
9452,tt0247804,1259,3,"The original ""Planet of the Apes"" was an intelligent and thought provoking movie with a very clear message."
9453,tt0247804,1259,4,"It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting."
9454,tt0247804,1259,5,"This movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues."
9455,tt0247804,1259,6,Instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie.
9456,tt0247804,1259,7,"Dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are non existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on."
9457,tt0247804,1259,8,"Instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny one liners and some very hollow quasi intelligent conversations."
9458,tt0247804,1259,9,The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic.
9459,tt0247804,1259,10,"The make up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too."
9460,tt0247804,1259,11,"However, this does not distract from the fact that ""Planet of the Apes 2001"" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paper thin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly non existent plot."
9461,tt0247804,1259,12,"Please Hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters."
9462,tt0247804,1259,13,"Oh yeah, the ending did not make ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER. out of  stars, mainly for the visuals"
9463,tt0377818,3273,1,The Dukes of Hazzard is quite an achievement ¬ñ a $53m film that's worse than any given episode of a downmarket 25 year old TV show.
9464,tt0377818,3273,2,"The plot is serviceable enough but the mindless fun is rarely to be found and the casting is pretty atrocious: Johnny Knoxville is more passenger than protagonist, M.C."
9465,tt0377818,3273,3,"Gainey's Sheriff Roscoe is a bland thug, Michael Weston's Enos tiresome, a seemingly ideally cast Willie Nelson just seems to be waiting for the check to clear and Burt Reynolds, stuck in some purgatory where he's doomed to relive his old movies as a bit player, is a curious choice for Boss Hogg to say the least but does have one good moment with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill."
9466,tt0377818,3273,4,"You know a film is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen presences¬Ö But worse than the script or the casting is Jay Chandrasekhar's hopeless direction: seemingly born with no conception of comic timing, unable to do much more than basic two shots and seemingly clueless as to how to shoot a car chase let alone the couple of decent stunts in the film, he seems determined to sap the film of any signs of life before they materialise."
9467,tt0377818,3273,5,"There are a couple of neat post modern moments revolving around the Confederate Flag and Daisy's stereotypical role in every episode, but no film that makes you pine for the days when Hal Needham was directing this sort of thing and badly can be a good thing."
9468,tt0377818,3274,1,"Once again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, a TV series is turned into a full length film and gets ruined for all the hundreds of people that watched."
9469,tt0377818,3274,2,"Basically the Duke cousins, Luke Johnny Knoxville and Bo Seann William Scott in Hazzard County, spend a lot of time driving very fast in ""The General Lee""."
9470,tt0377818,3274,3,But they need to get their act together and stop their family farm being destroyed along with almost the whole town by nasty Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg Razzie nominated Burt Reynolds to make way for a huge coal mine.

9475,tt0377818,3274,8,"I think the only reason I give the film an extra star is because of a couple of impressive car stunts, and of course the gorgeous body of Simpson I'll admit her legs aren't quite Catherine Bach, but still!, but besides that it is pretty boring."
9476,tt0377818,3274,9,"It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Jay Chandrasekhar, Worst Remake or Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Simpson & Her ""Daisy Dukes"" and Worst Screenplay."
9477,tt0377818,3274,10,Pretty poor!

9479,tt0377818,3275,2,THIS MOVIE WILL DISSAPPOINT YOU BADLY!
9480,tt0377818,3275,3,"First of all, this movie starts out with Bo and Luke running moonshine for Jesse."
9481,tt0377818,3275,4,Bo and Luke would not do that ever on the real series!
9482,tt0377818,3275,5,This movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series.
9483,tt0377818,3275,6,"In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest, and law abiding."
9484,tt0377818,3275,7,"In this movie, he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of Georgia."
9485,tt0377818,3275,8,"Plus, if this was an extension adding on to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion!"
9486,tt0377818,3275,9,"and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: HOW COULD UNCLE JESSE BE MAKING MOONSHINE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE DUKES OF HAZZARD IN Hollywood MOVIE."

9490,tt0377818,3275,13,"If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting, disgraced movie!"
9491,tt0377818,3275,14,"If you want to see good Dukes movies, either buy the original series, or go out to walmart.com and buy the DVD set of 2 that includes the Reunion, and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies!"
9492,tt0377818,3275,15,"They both star the original cast, and are family friendly!"
9493,tt0377818,3275,16,Don't waste your time on a movie that isn't worth the CD it's written on!
9494,tt0377818,3276,1,"The 1980s TV show, updated with fresh female flesh, and raunchy language."
9495,tt0377818,3276,2,"""The Dukes of Hazzard"" passed me by; it was not repeated whenever I was in front of the television in either New York or California; or, I probably would have watched."
9496,tt0377818,3276,3,"Still, from somewhere like the clips accompanying this film's updated 2005 release, I knew it was about a fast, orange Dodge Charger and, the ""General Lee"" is still good to go."

9503,tt0377818,3277,3,This movie was HORRIBLE!
9504,tt0377818,3277,4,Main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what I call entertainment.
9505,tt0377818,3277,5,They took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash.
9506,tt0377818,3277,6,Daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services.

9508,tt0377818,3277,8,I stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute.
9509,tt0377818,3277,9,I wish I had never seen this movie.
9510,tt0377818,3277,10,It trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when I left.

9516,tt0377818,3278,5,"Well let me tell you something, I am 24 so I am a long way from being and OLD FOGIE, and I won't get over it, it was a DISGRACE TO ALL THAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY."
9517,tt0377818,3278,6,"The only thing right in the movie title was ""HAZZARD."""
9518,tt0377818,3278,7,"Was all the profanity, smoking, and drinking really necessary."
9519,tt0377818,3278,8,The cast was terrible.
9520,tt0377818,3278,9,Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe it has all gone to her head.
9521,tt0377818,3278,10,"She is in NO way a Daisy Duke, a fluke maybe, but definitely no Duke."
9522,tt0377818,3278,11,"I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as Bo."
9523,tt0377818,3278,12,"They should have included the original cast as at least cameos, but even Hollywood knew they wouldn't approve of the script."
9524,tt0377818,3278,13,I mean come on people even todays actors and actresses are voicing a negative opinion so why are some of you giving positive remarks.
9525,tt0377818,3279,1,Oh Geez...
9526,tt0377818,3279,2,There are so many other films I want to see out there...
9527,tt0377818,3279,3,I got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and this is what he wanted Yeah...
9528,tt0377818,3279,4,"I used to watch this show when I was in college...it was mindless, kinda fun, and somewhat action oriented."
9529,tt0377818,3279,5,The show had a good heart tho...and the characters were cute; no one ever got killed or even hurt badly... it was like a cartoon come to life.
9530,tt0377818,3279,6,Cut to 2005...
9531,tt0377818,3279,7,What happened.
9532,tt0377818,3279,8,This one doesn't work.
9533,tt0377818,3279,9,"As others have said, there simply isn't a cohesive story and the performances are weird...almost annoying definitely not faithful to the original characters...the whole thing is a like a Mad TV skit and it lasts over 100 minutes!"
9534,tt0377818,3279,10,This was one of the few times I've been EMBARRASSED watching a film.
9535,tt0377818,3279,11,What were they thinking.
9536,tt0377818,3279,12,"As best I can tell, must've been for the product marketing, toys, etc."
9537,tt0377818,3279,13,"All I can say is, let this one die a quick death."
9538,tt0377818,3279,14,It makes the original Dukes of Hazzard seem like Masterpiece Theater...
9539,tt0377818,3279,15,I think the only remake left to do from TV is Gilligan's Island...
9540,tt0377818,3279,16,Good Luck!
9541,tt0377818,3280,1,i wont go and give them my 10 bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best.
9542,tt0377818,3280,2,At least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing.
9543,tt0377818,3280,3,I have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original.
9544,tt0377818,3280,4,And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke.
9545,tt0377818,3280,5,Those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all.
9546,tt0377818,3280,6,And since when is American Pie have anything to do with the Dukes SHAME ON them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car.
9547,tt0377818,3280,7,That in itself should have gotten the movie a R rating.
9548,tt0377818,3280,8,The only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals.
9549,tt0377818,3280,9,Lets all hope.
9550,tt0377818,3280,10,So the people out there that went and seen the movie will see how it should have looked
9551,tt0377818,3281,1,I had suspicions the movie was going to be bad.
9552,tt0377818,3281,2,I'm a Duke's fan from way back.
9553,tt0377818,3281,3,Have three years of the TV series on DVD.
9554,tt0377818,3281,4,Well I was right.
9555,tt0377818,3281,5,Took the family to see it.
9556,tt0377818,3281,6,I really wanted to see the General jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good.
9557,tt0377818,3281,7,"But to sum it up, the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the TV show."
9558,tt0377818,3281,8,Jessica Simpson was pathetic.
9559,tt0377818,3281,9,"While I can honestly say that the original Daisy's outfits were just as revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was simply awful."
9560,tt0377818,3281,10,Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must be rolling in their graves as well.
9561,tt0377818,3281,11,Don't waste your money.
9562,tt0377818,3281,12,If you are an old tried and true Dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed.
9563,tt0377818,3282,1,The Dukes of Hazzard will academy awards!!
9564,tt0377818,3282,2,Best actor and actress 4 the persons who can say with a straight face that this was a great movie.
9565,tt0377818,3282,3,"This ""movie"" was a torture to watch."
9566,tt0377818,3282,4,So sad how an weekly half hour entertainment was destroyed by these amateurs.
9567,tt0377818,3282,5,The only good thing about this crap was the car!
9568,tt0377818,3282,6,I remember when Daisy was a real threat to look 4ward 2.
9569,tt0377818,3282,7,Who's the moron that decided that Jessica Simpson is hot.!
9570,tt0377818,3282,8,We know she can't act but come on.
9571,tt0377818,3282,9,In the TV show Daisy was a fox and brunette.
9572,tt0377818,3282,10,"All members who contributed in these waste of time please please please don't even think about makin a sequel, a prequel or anything that's got 2 do with a former TV show."
9573,tt0377818,3282,11,"I gave a empty DVD so this ""movie"" could be burned 4 me."
9574,tt0377818,3282,12,I sat trough it and i want my money back!
9575,tt0377818,3283,1,"OK we all love the daisy dukes, but what is up with this cast."
9576,tt0377818,3283,2,"Lets start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not one thing country about this girl and Daisy was not ditzy!"
9577,tt0377818,3283,3,Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original.
9578,tt0377818,3283,4,"No offense to Burt, but I never noticed Boss HOg being so tall."
9579,tt0377818,3283,5,That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size.
9580,tt0377818,3283,6,Did they even try someone like Danny Devito.!.
9581,tt0377818,3283,7,"OK , now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband."
9582,tt0377818,3283,8,He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!!
9583,tt0377818,3283,9,Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members.
9584,tt0377818,3283,10,The screen t's were never present on the dukes!!
9585,tt0377818,3283,11,This made the movie a turn off from the beginning.
9586,tt0377818,3283,12,I give this a HUGE thumbs down.
9587,tt0377818,3284,1,Have I seen a worse movie.
9588,tt0377818,3284,2,"Perhaps only ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" dragged more than ""Dukes""."
9589,tt0377818,3284,3,I had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point.
9590,tt0377818,3284,4,Let's touch on a few...
9591,tt0377818,3284,5,There was a noticeable script death and rebirth when Sheev is talking to the Dukes and they don't respond.
9592,tt0377818,3284,6,"He shrugs and moves on, since neither the Knoxville or Scott know what he's talking about nor do we."
9593,tt0377818,3284,7,It was like the engine died and was restarted.
9594,tt0377818,3284,8,The few times the General Lee flew through the air weren't even that exciting.
9595,tt0377818,3284,9,Nothing I haven't seen on the TV Series.
9596,tt0377818,3284,10,Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott.
9597,tt0377818,3284,11,The best part was when Bo is upset at Luke for stealing the girl he liked.
9598,tt0377818,3284,12,The only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it although roughly.
9599,tt0377818,3284,13,The rest of the time it seems distant and forced.
9600,tt0377818,3284,14,"Seann William Scott's awful, horrendous accent or lack thereof."
9601,tt0377818,3284,15,I hated Willie Nelson's performance.
9602,tt0377818,3284,16,Were bad jokes supposed to be endearing.
9603,tt0377818,3284,17,I wanted him to disappear.
9604,tt0377818,3284,18,Jessica Simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen.
9605,tt0377818,3284,19,She actually felt like one of the better actors in the film.
9606,tt0377818,3284,20,That's telling you how horrible this movie is.
9607,tt0377818,3284,21,She's a goddess.
9608,tt0377818,3284,22,"During the climax of the film, I was rooting for Boss Hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices."
9609,tt0377818,3284,23,A nuclear bomb would have sufficed.
9610,tt0377818,3284,24,"This is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film, but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film."
9611,tt0377818,3284,25,If only we could erase and start over...
9612,tt0377818,3285,1,"When a movie like ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" brings in over $75 million it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society."
9613,tt0377818,3285,2,Either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from trash like this or maybe I'm just not realizing how many people this kind of no effort trash will appeal to.
9614,tt0377818,3285,3,Hollywood has had no incentive to make good movies since if it puts out trash then people will see it anyways since there is nothing else on screen.
9615,tt0377818,3285,4,This is that.
9616,tt0377818,3285,5,I walked out despite getting a free movie pass.
9617,tt0377818,3285,6,The dialogue could not be dumber.
9618,tt0377818,3285,7,The stunts could not be more over the top and outrageous.
9619,tt0377818,3285,8,"Perhaps this ""bigger that big"" image appeals to Texans but it didn't appeal to me nor anyone else in the theater."
9620,tt0377818,3285,9,"None of the ""big names"" were in this career ending flick, except for Burt Reynolds, which says all you need to hear."
9621,tt0377818,3285,10,Jessica Simpson don't make me laugh.
9622,tt0377818,3285,11,"I wouldn't even recommend this film for video, even if you were desperate."
9623,tt0377818,3285,12,This was all about fooling the public to make enough money after opening day to equal or do better than it cost through marketing.
9624,tt0377818,3285,13,They did despite the public being forewarned.
9625,tt0377818,3285,14,Stupidity abound.
9626,tt0377818,3286,1,I don't understand why making remakes has become the trend.
9627,tt0377818,3286,2,"Every remake I have ever seen is awful, and this is no exception."
9628,tt0377818,3286,3,"If any of you have seen the quote from Ben Jones, that it is a ""sleazy"" piece of trash, he is quite right."
9629,tt0377818,3286,4,"Why they would take a wonderful television show, which I loved, have never missed an episode, and own seasons 1 4 on DVD, and ruin it, I'll never know."
9630,tt0377818,3286,5,"The television show was a family show, and although Daisy has the body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed in the show, save the outfits."
9631,tt0377818,3286,6,"A family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage, and I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it."
9632,tt0377818,3286,7,"Another thing I didn't like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors along with the rest of the original cast, and they are also extremely cute."
9633,tt0377818,3286,8,The new Bo and Luke are not even a little cute.
9634,tt0377818,3286,9,That was one of the drawers for the show.
9635,tt0377818,3286,10,The casting is terrible.
9636,tt0377818,3286,11,They could have at least gotten a brunette for Daisy.
9637,tt0377818,3286,12,"I don't think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg, either."
9638,tt0377818,3286,13,Every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role.
9639,tt0377818,3286,14,"The only role they cast halfway decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but still it is no comparison."
9640,tt0377818,3286,15,"Denver Pyle is an actor all his own, and that made him perfect for the role."
9641,tt0377818,3286,16,"I think that the casting is awful, the story is awful, and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty, terrible movie."
9642,tt0377818,3286,17,I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it.
9643,tt0377818,3286,18,"I only saw it out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket in season 4 DVD."
9644,tt0377818,3286,19,"I would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free."
9645,tt0377818,3286,20,DON'T PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
9646,tt0377818,3287,1,"If this movie should be renamed, it should be ""The Jackasses of Hazzard."""
9647,tt0377818,3287,2,"To sum it up, this movie is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed 1968 Dodge Charger around town and in the country, chasing the girls and eluding the law."
9648,tt0377818,3287,3,"I have been a fan of the ""Dukes"" and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key."
9649,tt0377818,3287,4,"The overindulgence of profanity, sexual references, and drug use, has made the good name of the ""Dukes"" into trailer trash."
9650,tt0377818,3287,5,"Side from comparing it to the television show, the acting was horrible."
9651,tt0377818,3287,6,The only actor that got it right was the famed 1969 Dodge Charger named General Lee.
9652,tt0377818,3287,7,The others have exaggerated the character's role which tarnished the movie.
9653,tt0377818,3287,8,"The ""Dukes"" have been another casualty of the 21 st century Hollywood television to big screen transition tragedy."
9654,tt0377818,3287,9,Skip this movie and just buy the television series on DVD.My grade: F
9655,tt0377818,3288,1,"Hollywood now has officially gone too far and I really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine backlash against their crap machines, in spite of the good box office returns."
9656,tt0377818,3288,2,"If you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next, STOP."
9657,tt0377818,3288,3,"Stop making our TV shows into these repellent, stupid, money grubbing waste of time movies that suck."
9658,tt0377818,3288,4,"By doing so you are proving one thing: Hollywood is out of ideas, and going to see the movies they churn out only perpetuates the cycle of disgust."
9659,tt0377818,3288,5,What's next You guys gonna go & ruin The Bionic Man..
9660,tt0377818,3288,6,"The film is just plain wrong, and manages to get the most stupid, simple fact of the show totally incorrect by forgetting or ignoring that Tom Wopat & John Schneider's Bo & Luke Duke were REFORMED moonshiners."
9661,tt0377818,3288,7,"They had been busted, learned their lesson, gone straight, and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite tipped arrows from hunting bows & drive like Steve McQueen."
9662,tt0377818,3288,8,"Denver Pyle's Uncle Jessie was also the moral center of the family, always insisting that the Boys do good, even at their own expense or embarrassment while he made sandwiches and coffee for when the chores were done."
9663,tt0377818,3288,9,They always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naivet√© about them that was quite appealing.
9664,tt0377818,3288,10,"We wanted to be more like them than we were, sorta."
9665,tt0377818,3288,11,"My favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belts before roaring off, which was apparently too moral for this film."
9666,tt0377818,3288,12,"By transforming the Duke family into a pack of leering, wisecracking, criminally minded, redneck baiting, misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint, where the show was all about how honest or incorruptible the Dukes were Are the Duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys."
9667,tt0377818,3288,13,I wanted to punch them both in the nose.
9668,tt0377818,3288,14,"They seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing chores back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends, if not acting like a pair of 14 year old boys who haven't grown up."
9669,tt0377818,3288,15,"There should be no marijuana use, no gawking at buxom, nubile coeds & their breasts, no shenanigans involving the Brothers in da Hood."
9670,tt0377818,3288,16,All of it looks like the work of a marketing consultant who took a poll at the mall of what 14 year old boys like to see in movies.
9671,tt0377818,3288,17,"The problem being that 14 year old boys cannot possibly remember the show, IMHO shouldn't be seeing this movie either, and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers, director & producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money, which is exactly how I feel."
9672,tt0377818,3288,18,What were they thinking...
9673,tt0377818,3288,19,And boy did they EVER get Daisy wrong.
9674,tt0377818,3288,20,"Jessica Simpson all dolled up like a Pamela Anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace, but you can service your needs just fine downloading some promotional stills of her, printing them up & pinning them to the wall in a restroom."
9675,tt0377818,3288,21,"She is hardly in the film at all which is the movie's only saving grace, and the ten minutes or so they used her was STILL excessive."
9676,tt0377818,3288,22,"Catherine Bach's Daisy may have had the same kind of shorts, and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her, but the Daisy she played was a PERSON."
9677,tt0377818,3288,23,The pratfalls she elicited by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it.
9678,tt0377818,3288,24,She remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home.
9679,tt0377818,3288,25,"And most importantly she was a sweet, caring person who couldn't help it if the guys went Ga Ga over her."
9680,tt0377818,3288,26,"By contrast, Jessica Simpson appears phony, contrived, made up, costumed, posed, aloof, bored, out of place, and I don't think she even looks that great in the outfit."
9681,tt0377818,3288,27,"She doesn't look like a person but a plot device, conjured up during a deal with someone representing her agent."
9682,tt0377818,3288,28,Ms.
9683,tt0377818,3288,29,Simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened.
9684,tt0377818,3288,30,"Whatever the joke was, she isn't in on it and is disgracefully exploited for T&A."
9685,tt0377818,3288,31,"If that's all she wants from her career, executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least, because this effort was just pathetic."
9686,tt0377818,3288,32,The bottom line is SKIP IT.
9687,tt0377818,3288,33,For the cost of two tickets and a Slurpee to go you can pick up one of Warner Bros. excellent box set collections of the original shows on DVD and the entire family can watch them together.
9688,tt0377818,3288,34,That was why it worked.
9689,tt0377818,3288,35,The only real purpose I can see in the film might be it's future use as an interrogation tool at Guantanamo Bay.
9690,tt0377818,3288,36,"Twenty minutes of this & they'll be singing a choir.1/10, and I mean it."
9691,tt0377818,3288,37,"And STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THE BIONIC MAN, you schnooks."
9692,tt0377818,3289,1,"I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on TV."
9693,tt0377818,3289,2,Did we really need a big screen re make.
9694,tt0377818,3289,3,Did they ask the fans.
9695,tt0377818,3289,4,"I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears, and Kiefer Southerland, took out all the music, and made it a drama."
9696,tt0377818,3289,5,Do you think they would like that!
9697,tt0377818,3289,6,This movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had.
9698,tt0377818,3289,7,"Sure the original was a bit corny at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people that passed through town."
9699,tt0377818,3289,8,"None of that mattered to the people that made this film, they might have never even seen the original show all the way through."
9700,tt0377818,3289,9,"My big question is, what will they ruin next."
9701,tt0377818,3290,1,This movie sucked !
9702,tt0377818,3290,2,"They took something from my childhood ,and raped it in an outhouse!"
9703,tt0377818,3290,3,"This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and hold my ""Dukes"" dvds and cry in a corner."
9704,tt0377818,3290,4,The cast was terrible !
9705,tt0377818,3290,5,"It wasn't ""The Dukes"", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car."
9706,tt0377818,3290,6,When was Boss Hogg evil.
9707,tt0377818,3290,7,When was Rosco a tough guy.
9708,tt0377818,3290,8,They never were !
9709,tt0377818,3290,9,Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot.
9710,tt0377818,3290,10,When did Jesse smoke pot.
9711,tt0377818,3290,11,He never did !
9712,tt0377818,3290,12,"Now don't get me wrong,I'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba, but it had no place in this movie!"
9713,tt0377818,3290,13,The only thing good about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the end credits.
9714,tt0377818,3290,14,It was a waste of money time and air.
9715,tt0377818,3290,15,Avoid at all costs!!!!!!!!
9716,tt0377818,3291,1,"First let me say that I am not a Dukes fan, but after this movie the series looked like Law and Order."
9717,tt0377818,3291,2,The worst thing was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg.
9718,tt0377818,3291,3,"Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse was M.C."
9719,tt0377818,3291,4,"Gainey as Roscoe, If they ever watched the show Roscoe was not a hard ass cop."
9720,tt0377818,3291,5,He was more a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie.
9721,tt0377818,3291,6,"The movie is loaded with the usual errors, cars getting torn up, and continues like nothing happened."
9722,tt0377818,3291,7,"The worst example of this is when the the General gets together with Billy Prickett, and the General is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop, but goes on to win the race."
9723,tt0377818,3292,1,"For this review,a list of good points and bad points."
9724,tt0377818,3292,2,I'll start with the bad.
9725,tt0377818,3292,3,"Bad points:The casting choicesespecially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg,the acting of said badly chosen cast,the storyline,the idea of setting the film in the modern day,the direction,the editing,the soundtrack,and above all,the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that wasn't that great to start with,despite it's popularity."
9726,tt0377818,3292,4,Good points:Jessica Simpson in a red bikini............that's it!
9727,tt0377818,3292,5,One might make an analogy here.
9728,tt0377818,3292,6,"In the scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke struts her way up to Michael Weston as Enos,and asks the question,""Enos,where's Boss Hogg and Roscoe."",in his clouded judgment, tells her where they are."
9729,tt0377818,3292,7,"She might just as well have asked,""Enos,is this a good movie."",the red bikini would have clouded his judgment into saying yes,even though in his right mind he would have said,""No, not really."""
9730,tt0377818,3292,8,"As good as she looked in the bikini,she could have been stark naked,and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film making."
9731,tt0377818,3292,9,Stay out of Hazzard!
9732,tt0377818,3293,1,What a snore fest.
9733,tt0377818,3293,2,"Of all the bits of nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to remake and update, this is by far one of the most pointless."
9734,tt0377818,3293,3,"This was a totally pointless show in the first place, and we REALLY don't need a 'modern' update."
9735,tt0377818,3293,4,"Never mind the bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning, so many advances have been made, socially, since the show ran that the entire point of the show if it ever had one has been lost."
9736,tt0377818,3293,5,"Also, what is the point of having a character named Boss Hogg if he's NOT overweight."
9737,tt0377818,3294,1,"In Hazzard County, Georgia, cousins Bo and Luke Duke Scott, Knoxville and their cousin Daisy Duke Jessica Simpson run moonshine made by their Uncle Jesse Willie Nelson while avoiding the local authority, Boss Hog Burt Reynolds."
9738,tt0377818,3294,2,Their problems with the Boss are only beginning as they learn he's been plotting to strip mine the town for valuable ores found below it.
9739,tt0377818,3294,3,"I have never seen the TV show and after watching the movie, I'm not going to start any time soon."
9740,tt0377818,3294,4,I like stupid comedies but this one didn't offer many laughs.
9741,tt0377818,3294,5,It was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through.
9742,tt0377818,3294,6,The second part was a little better but this film was still a missed opportunity.
9743,tt0377818,3294,7,The film focused on Bo and Luke way too much.
9744,tt0377818,3294,8,The characters in general weren't very interesting and the actors portraying them didn't do a very good job.
9745,tt0377818,3294,9,The acting wasn't very good.
9746,tt0377818,3294,10,I wasn't expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny.
9747,tt0377818,3294,11,Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville both give below average performances.
9748,tt0377818,3294,12,The latter was pretty good as Stifler but he tries way too hard here.
9749,tt0377818,3294,13,The latter just seems to be looking for a paycheck and nothing else.
9750,tt0377818,3294,14,Jessica Simpson isn't known for her acting nor is she really known for her singing.
9751,tt0377818,3294,15,She's famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things.
9752,tt0377818,3294,16,She is pretty but she's a weak actor.
9753,tt0377818,3294,17,It doesn't matter though because she doesn't really appear in the movie and the character she plays isn't complex or anything.
9754,tt0377818,3294,18,Willie Nelson also has a minor role and he doesn't do anything special.
9755,tt0377818,3294,19,The screenplay was written by John O'Brien and he made two films prior to the Dukes of Hazzard.
9756,tt0377818,3294,20,"The first one was Cradle to the Grave, which was okay."
9757,tt0377818,3294,21,The second one was Starsky and Hutch which was pretty funny.
9758,tt0377818,3294,22,He doesn't do a good job here though as the story is a mess.
9759,tt0377818,3294,23,He also forgot to add jokes and a few other things that would have made this film work better.
9760,tt0377818,3294,24,The movie is also pretty long for a comedy.
9761,tt0377818,3294,25,"Okay, 106 minutes isn't exactly long but it feels so much longer because there's very little humor in the first hour."
9762,tt0377818,3294,26,I think comedies should be kept short or else they have to find a lot of material to cover the entire running time.
9763,tt0377818,3294,27,The Dukes of Hazzard barely has enough funny gags to keep it going for thirty minutes let alone 106 minutes.
9764,tt0377818,3294,28,The car sequences were average and they don't save an already troubled film.
9765,tt0377818,3294,29,"In the end, Dukes of Hazzard may appeal to a few people but most people will probably find it dull and it's better if you just skip it."
9766,tt0377818,3294,30,Rating 4/10
9767,tt0377818,3295,1,...then you'd better not watch this movie.
9768,tt0377818,3295,2,They've completely ruined the premise of the show.
9769,tt0377818,3295,3,"In the movie the Duke boys are idiots, Daisy is trampy, Roscoe is sinister, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal...only Cooter and Flash are true to the original characters."
9770,tt0377818,3295,4,At least Enos is kinda close.
9771,tt0377818,3295,5,At one point they open the doors to get into the General Lee nuff said.
9772,tt0377818,3295,6,"The original show may not have been great TV, but it was entertaining and the characters made sense."
9773,tt0377818,3295,7,This movie is like Dumb & Dumber meets the Simple Life.
9774,tt0377818,3296,1,"Film makeovers of old TV shows seems to be the norm in Hollywood these days, but this disrespectful, toilet humor, do you kiss your mother with that mouth foul language, rip off is a blatant middle finger to all Dukes of Hazzard fans both north and south of the Mason Dixon Line."
9775,tt0377818,3296,2,From the opening sequence of Bo and Luke Duke making a moonshine run for Uncle Jesse no shine running in the show because it would put the boys back in jail as a parole violation to the closing sequence of Uncle Jesse smoking weed with the Governor of Georgia Uncle Jesse was the moral compass despite his previous moonshining ways this disappointing waste of film is an open faced insult.
9776,tt0377818,3296,3,I can't tell you how many parents I saw get up and remove their children from the theater within the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized that they had been horribly deceived.
9777,tt0377818,3296,4,The Original Dukes of Hazzard was a family show with basic moral values.
9778,tt0377818,3296,5,"The Original Dukes of Hazzard was a kid safe, Hemi powered, show of fun that parents didn't have to worry about teaching their kids George Carlin's seven words."
9779,tt0377818,3296,6,I have read reviews stating that the show and the movie are nothing but racist.
9780,tt0377818,3296,7,Those commits might be correct about the movie.
9781,tt0377818,3296,8,Those commits are ABSOLUTELY incorrect about the show.
9782,tt0377818,3296,9,"The show, if anything, was about how to get along and be friends with ANYONE."
9783,tt0377818,3296,10,"Hollywood has finally come out in the open about their disdain for those of us, Yankee, Rebel, or otherwise, who still believe in honor, loyalty, trust, family, and doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing."
9784,tt0377818,3296,11,"Hollywood has finally brought to light its belief that those of us in the heartland are stupid, uneducated, beer swilling, foul mouthed, trash that will buy any piece of garbage they are willing to sell."
9785,tt0377818,3296,12,Prove the Hollywood Elitist that they are wrong.
9786,tt0377818,3296,13,DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE.
9787,tt0377818,3296,14,Boycott the sponsors.
9788,tt0377818,3296,15,Fill Warner Bros. email and snail mail boxes with complaints that we don't appreciate them destroying one of the greatest T.V. shows of all time.
9789,tt0377818,3296,16,"Save your money and buy the DVD's of the original show, but whatever you do¬Ö DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE"
9790,tt0377818,3297,1,Why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it.
9791,tt0377818,3297,2,They ask why Hollywood isn't making the money it used to.
9792,tt0377818,3297,3,Because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay $10 to see their garbage.
9793,tt0377818,3297,4,"The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where the good IL' boys come out on top."
9794,tt0377818,3297,5,It wasn't Gone with the Wind but it was fun.
9795,tt0377818,3297,6,This movie is garbage!
9796,tt0377818,3297,7,Hollywood can't come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some $$$$.
9797,tt0377818,3297,8,I only hope that this movie makes 10x's less than it cost to make.
9798,tt0377818,3297,9,The only one's to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the General Lee.
9799,tt0377818,3297,10,The audience is the victim.
9800,tt0377818,3297,11,"Don't see it, watch the reruns of the TV show instead."
9801,tt0377818,3297,12,They still hold up 20 years later.
9802,tt0377818,3298,1,"When I heard that the Dukes of Hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script, I was like, ""alright, I'll give it a chance, it's not going to be better than the first, but we'll see what happens."""
9803,tt0377818,3298,2,"Well, I saw what happened."
9804,tt0377818,3298,3,"I saw a great late 70's/80's show that was a classic, basically humiliated by Hollywood."
9805,tt0377818,3298,4,It's so sad to see that Hollywood scriptwriters cannot come up with something original these days.
9806,tt0377818,3298,5,"They are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience, and try to ""REMAKE"" the classic show."
9807,tt0377818,3298,6,HEADS UP Hollywood...
9808,tt0377818,3298,7,IT AIN'T WORKIN!!!!
9809,tt0377818,3298,8,"Anyway, more about the show."
9810,tt0377818,3298,9,I think they could have casted a better actor than Sean William Scott Stiffler from American Pie to play Bo.
9811,tt0377818,3298,10,I'm sure that John Schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of.
9812,tt0377818,3298,11,"Also, Get for real, Johnny Knoxville, as Luke Duke."
9813,tt0377818,3298,12,How low can you go..
9814,tt0377818,3298,13,A crappy jackass actor to play lovable Luke.
9815,tt0377818,3298,14,This sickens me.
9816,tt0377818,3298,15,"Also, I'll give Jessica Simpson is a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks."
9817,tt0377818,3298,16,"Catherine Bach who played the original Daisy, was smart, sexy, strong, opinionated and a good IL' southern girl."
9818,tt0377818,3298,17,She was every little girls role model growing up!
9819,tt0377818,3298,18,I owned the doll and the Jeep thank you very much!!!
9820,tt0377818,3298,19,"Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, 2 bit slut as Daisy Duke."
9821,tt0377818,3298,20,Daisy never was blonde.
9822,tt0377818,3298,21,Why did they have to cast her.
9823,tt0377818,3298,22,Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke.
9824,tt0377818,3298,23,"She can speak with a great southern accent, and she is gorgeous, and would have done a wonderful job."
9825,tt0377818,3298,24,"Anyway, I'd like to say that this movie blew something fierce."
9826,tt0377818,3298,25,"I feel like I got ripped off by paying $8.50 for tickets, and they should refund my money."
9827,tt0377818,3298,26,If you like the Dukes of Hazzard the original series don't see this movie.
9828,tt0377818,3298,27,It'll just upset you.
9829,tt0377818,3298,28,CMT country music television plays the reruns of the Dukes all the time later at night.
9830,tt0377818,3298,29,"So set your TIVO's and go with the real thing, not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood."
9831,tt0780595,7126,1,"I mean, I thought I heard this dialog in the movie, but it was so bad and out of place that I can't really believe it."
9832,tt0780595,7126,2,"I was laughing so hard at what must have been the worst writing and acting in human history, i was seriously worried that I might have a heart attack and die right there in the theater."
9833,tt0780595,7126,3,"So this is the scene I am talking about, the ""hero"" just watched his brother crash and his brothers car exploded right there just feet away from him the hero."
9834,tt0780595,7126,4,"The ""hero"" was throwing the expected ""fit"" at seeing something so tragic and people were trying to hold him back from running into the burning car."
9835,tt0780595,7126,5,"In the middle of his fit and his uncontrollable rage/emotional break down he says ""I am so sad"" he said that right."
9836,tt0780595,7126,6,Am I crazy.
9837,tt0780595,7127,1,This movie was bad to say the least!!!
9838,tt0780595,7127,2,The plethora of superb cars are disgraced to have have been showcased in this LAME movie.
9839,tt0780595,7127,3,It starts off with a race from L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min...in a Ferrari F430.
9840,tt0780595,7127,4,I did that in 1HR 50min in a tiny 4cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord.
9841,tt0780595,7127,5,Seriously...this movie does not do justice to these cars.
9842,tt0780595,7127,6,Obviously these writers are just that and probably drive under the speed limit with their hands @ 10 & 2 o'clock.
9843,tt0780595,7127,7,I remember seeing on the news how Eddie Griffin crashed a 1.5 million dollar Ferrari Enzo going 30 40MPH>>> youtube.com/watch.v=cNVrMZX2kms And...the director ANDY CHENG is THE biggest SELLOUT!!!
9844,tt0780595,7127,8,He brings shame to his own race.
9845,tt0780595,7127,9,I wonder just how many people he orally pleased just to break into Hollywood.
9846,tt0780595,7127,10,He partook in a movie that portrays Asian Americans in such a negative and FALSE way.
9847,tt0780595,7127,11,Asian women>>cheap money grubbing whores.
9848,tt0780595,7127,12,Asian men>>losing compulsive gamblers & thugs that get beat all the time .
9849,tt0780595,7127,13,What the heck is all the fear about asians..
9850,tt0780595,7127,14,Why the need to always portray them in such a negative connotation..
9851,tt0780595,7127,15,I am SO sick of the way Hollywood ALWAYS portrays asians in SUCH a negative and false pretext.
9852,tt0780595,7128,1,I am a dumber person for renting the DVD REDLINE.
9853,tt0780595,7128,2,Chicago Pictures who made this stupid movie never paid Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various automotive sites including mine which has an ALEXA rating of 16K.
9854,tt0780595,7128,3,"They ripped me off on the deal and now I am out $16,000 and they wasted much of my personal time peter rapport of Palisades Media you know who you are!"
9855,tt0780595,7128,4,Please don't rent or buy this movie!!!
9856,tt0780595,7128,5,It sucks and the people behind it are ripoff artists.
9857,tt0780595,7128,6,REDLINE has a cast of losers and poor actors!
9858,tt0780595,7128,7,This movie is a Joke
9859,tt0780595,7129,1,This will be best known for the Ferrari that was crashed when Eddie Griffin was doing promotion.
9860,tt0780595,7129,2,Tale of racing and betting is a poorly made by the numbers that appears to have a director who couldn't see the numbers.
9861,tt0780595,7129,3,Largely a point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it for a paycheck.
9862,tt0780595,7129,4,"This is not a good movie, but its not bad enough to be watchable and end up as a some what nothing film isn't worth bothering with no matter how you look at it."
9863,tt0780595,7129,5,"Misogynistic, despite the fact one of the leads is a woman, this is a film that was clearly made just to get the producer and director close to pretty girls."
9864,tt0780595,7129,6,Want evidence.
9865,tt0780595,7129,7,There are long lingering shots of women in next to nothing that serve no purpose other than perhaps to get a rise out of people too afraid to rent a porno or the Sports illustrated swimsuit DVD.Avoid this movie at all costs
9866,tt0780595,7130,1,This movie should have been named Need For Speed: The Movie.
9867,tt0780595,7130,2,For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot.
9868,tt0780595,7130,3,This applies perfectly to Redline.
9869,tt0780595,7130,4,The only thing about this movie that was A Level were the cars.
9870,tt0780595,7130,5,"The acting seemed forced and scripted, the premise was flimsy at best, and the plot was almost nonexistent."
9871,tt0780595,7130,6,"I only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and, while it was pretty bad, it could have been worse."
9872,tt0780595,7130,7,And at least it was entertaining.
9873,tt0780595,7130,8,I just wish they had showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie.
9874,tt0780595,7130,9,"All in all, don't pay for it, don't go out of your way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there isn't anything else on, it's a decent distraction."
9875,tt0780595,7131,1,I like bad movies.
9876,tt0780595,7131,2,I like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration.
9877,tt0780595,7131,3,Then there are abhorrent movies like this.
9878,tt0780595,7131,4,"Redline is not just a bad movie, but a telling sign that maybe the American movie industry should please, for the sake of the viewer, at least proofread scripts before funding a movie."
9879,tt0780595,7131,5,"If a stereotype took a crap, this movie would spawn from that."
9880,tt0780595,7131,6,"The storyline is unbearable, and the acting all around is laughable."
9881,tt0780595,7131,7,"Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have, perhaps, the worst screen chemistry I've seen in a good while, and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for."
9882,tt0780595,7131,8,"Furthermore, how Angus Macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that I can't even think of an analogy."
9883,tt0780595,7131,9,"I am a loyal fan of his, but this has made me question him."
9884,tt0780595,7131,10,To sum it up.
9885,tt0780595,7131,11,"Several people want revenge for different reasons and if you care enough to know what they are, you're a bigger person than me, so much so that it turns to violence I guess."
9886,tt0780595,7131,12,"The movie is like Ouroboros, the snake that swallows its own tail, in that it's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears."
9887,tt0780595,7131,13,"This movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half, and an indecipherable action movie for the rest, it should be avoided at any and all costs."
9888,tt0780595,7131,14,"I wish I could find one positive aspect to this movie, and I think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll."
9889,tt0780595,7131,15,P.S.
9890,tt0780595,7131,16,"Nadia Bjorlin, if that was YOU singing those two songs in this movie, then you are a hack, and I hope old age ravages you."
9891,tt0780595,7131,17,P.S.S.
9892,tt0780595,7131,18,"If you DO rent this movie looking for a laughable experience, listen for the lyrics to Nadia Bjorlin's awesome songs."
9893,tt0780595,7132,1,You cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed.
9894,tt0780595,7132,2,"That's why movies like Fast and the Furious, Dhoom, Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences, especially local ones."
9895,tt0780595,7132,3,"We live on a tiny island, and I cannot fathom why, for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system, most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100% tax when they reach our shores, and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one."
9896,tt0780595,7132,4,"Not only that, the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear, lest they reach the sea."
9897,tt0780595,7132,5,And these movies are relatively easy to make.
9898,tt0780595,7132,6,Hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic.
9899,tt0780595,7132,7,"For once, those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long, can't compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these."
9900,tt0780595,7132,8,"Of course there are amongst us ahem those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models, and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame, however, they don't warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen, even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into Park."
9901,tt0780595,7132,9,"The guy sitting beside me, I swear he wet his pants every time his dream cars appear, and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans."
9902,tt0780595,7132,10,"So there we have it, the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie."
9903,tt0780595,7132,11,"With the Fast and the Furious franchise, the Japanese models like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage, as does the GT."
9904,tt0780595,7132,12,"Here, the Ford GT takes on an incredibly drool worthy facade modification, that even I'm impressed, alongside the latest models like the Ferrari Enzos, Porshe Carerra GTs, Koenigsegg CCXs, and every car out there that has wings for doors."
9905,tt0780595,7132,13,"But seriously, my heart goes out to the cars each time they're mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment."
9906,tt0780595,7132,14,"I mean, this are perfectly fine, high performance models that are at the apex of motoring, but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow, they do so because they can,There's no story in Redline, just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties the cars that is that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible, and with the usual shots of pedals always the accelerator, mind you, tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy, and earn you no respect, steering wheels, gear shifts always shifting up and not down, all these while having the actors make pretend that they're the baddest asses with an engine, snarling and giving each other dirty looks."
9907,tt0780595,7132,15,"Not a very tall order for an actor, and that's why we get the most woeful performances ever, with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids."
9908,tt0780595,7132,16,"The heroine yes, it made a statement that girls can drive Natasha a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin is one of those million dollar finds a girl with model looks who don't mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil, who has racing pedigree within her, and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable every line had to do with cars, and when singing about love, just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts, lubricants and going for rides."
9909,tt0780595,7132,17,"Introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous Eddie Griffin, she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran, and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle."
9910,tt0780595,7132,18,"Everything else, well like I said, just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race."
9911,tt0780595,7132,19,"And it's almost always the same, as there's very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars, especially when you know the race is rigged for narrative reasons and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line."
9912,tt0780595,7132,20,"While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actors, and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker, Sun Kang, and of course, the star it created Vin Diesel, Redline had none, just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately."
9913,tt0780595,7132,21,"It looks like a TV movie in its treatment from the get go, with a very insipid opening sequence where it's one man, one car, and a 105 minutes race against time to get to Vegas."
9914,tt0780595,7132,22,"If not for the cars, then this movie seriously is a piece of junk, with bad acting, bad lines and bad action."
9915,tt0780595,7132,23,"Strictly for the car fans, or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines."
9916,tt0780595,7133,1,"I felt like I was watching the Fast and the Furious again, but with different actors and a little bit different plot."
9917,tt0780595,7133,2,I will say the cars in the film are very cool.
9918,tt0780595,7133,3,"So, if you like fast cars, then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining."
9919,tt0780595,7133,4,I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I've seen her from Days of our Lives.
9920,tt0780595,7133,5,"She is a really good singer, but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie."
9921,tt0780595,7133,6,I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would here on the radio.
9922,tt0780595,7133,7,"Since it is a Hollywood film, you have to give this story a little lee way, but in real life I don't think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car, fix a car engine, and be a lead singer."
9923,tt0780595,7133,8,It's just all very silly.
9924,tt0780595,7133,9,"Another side note, any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut."
9925,tt0780595,7133,10,But it was kinda of cool at the end when Natasha stops right before the finish line and screws Michael over.
9926,tt0780595,7133,11,Priceless.
9927,tt0780595,7133,12,FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for car freaks.
9928,tt0780595,7133,13,"So, if you like fast cars, then I'd recommend this."
9929,tt0780595,7134,1,So it has come to this.
9930,tt0780595,7134,2,"Fast, expensive cars that only the upper 1% will ever drive."
9931,tt0780595,7134,3,The girls that pose next to them in gearhead magazines.
9932,tt0780595,7134,4,Second tier and no name actors.
9933,tt0780595,7134,5,Cheap promotional appearances by people from niche culture.
9934,tt0780595,7134,6,This is the garbage that Hollywood has to offer.
9935,tt0780595,7134,7,Don't get me wrong; I love the mindless action flick with hot chicks as much as the next guy.
9936,tt0780595,7134,8,"But please, will the collective Braintrust that greenlights this stuff please stop, count to ten, breathe, have a hearty ""Woooooosaaaaaah"", then rewind twentyfive years and recall what made movies enjoyable once upon a time."
9937,tt0780595,7134,9,Then actually MAKE some movies like that again.
9938,tt0780595,7134,10,"I have nothing against poker, but the entire pop culture explosion it has enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous."
9939,tt0780595,7134,11,Everyone and their mother thinks their Maverick now not that half of them even will get that reference.
9940,tt0780595,7134,12,"Some executive said, ""Hey, what demographic do you want to leach $9.50 out of."""
9941,tt0780595,7134,13,"""I know, sir."
9942,tt0780595,7134,14,"The 18 35 market."""
9943,tt0780595,7134,15,"""Ok, let's give them poker, girls, and fast cars."""
9944,tt0780595,7134,16,"""Brilliant idea, sir."""
9945,tt0780595,7134,17,The result.
9946,tt0780595,7134,18,"A film that I've seen a hundred times late at night on Spike TV, and more often than not, starring Dolph Lundgren."
9947,tt0780595,7134,19,Now don't misunderstand me;I am not a film snob.
9948,tt0780595,7134,20,"Over the top artsy flicks like The English Patient don't float my boat, but generic films that should not have even been made straight to DVD bother the hell out of me too."
9949,tt0780595,7134,21,"Only adolescent gearheads will have their engines revved by this, and I imagine the ones in the higher end of their IQ range will see this for what it is: a junkyard."
9950,tt0780595,7135,1,"I'm sorry to say that there isn't really any way, in my opinion, that an Enzo would really be able to keep up with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo."
9951,tt0780595,7135,2,The power to weight advantage possessed by the S7 would just be too great.
9952,tt0780595,7135,3,The S7 has a power:weight ratio of 3.93 lbs/hp while the Enzo has 4.61 lbs/hp.
9953,tt0780595,7135,4,The S7s low end is much better too.
9954,tt0780595,7135,5,Sorry Ferrari fans but the Saleen just gets it done so much better.
9955,tt0780595,7135,6,"As for other parts of this film, I just have to say it's so substandard as to be pathetic."
9956,tt0780595,7135,7,The story is way too weak.
9957,tt0780595,7135,8,The acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps.
9958,tt0780595,7135,9,I can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem.
9959,tt0780595,7135,10,This film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about.
9960,tt0780595,7135,11,Its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too.
9961,tt0780595,7135,12,"I can't give the film a ""1 Star"" rating because it didn't compel me to actually walk out of the theater."
9962,tt0780595,7135,13,I also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal....although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of 'Variety'.ps: the guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO the skid row version of James Vanderbeek.
9963,tt0780595,7136,1,"""A total waste of time"" Just throw in a few explosions, non stop fighting, exotic cars a deranged millionaire, slow motion computer generated car crashes and last but not least a Hugh Hefner like character with wall to wall hot babes, and mix in a blender and you will have this sorry excuse for a movie."
9964,tt0780595,7136,2,"I really got a laugh out of the ""Dr."
9965,tt0780595,7136,3,"Evil"" like heavily fortified compound."
9966,tt0780595,7136,4,The plot was somewhere between preposterous and non existent.
9967,tt0780595,7136,5,How many millionaires are willing to make a 25 million dollar bet on a car race.
9968,tt0780595,7136,6,"Answer: 4 but, didn't they become millionaires through fiscal responsibility."
9969,tt0780595,7136,7,"This was written for pubescent males, it plays like a video game."
9970,tt0780595,7136,8,I did enjoy the Gulfstream II landing in the desert though.
9971,tt0780595,7137,1,The cars in this movie are awesome.
9972,tt0780595,7137,2,The acting in this movie is awful.
9973,tt0780595,7137,3,The plot and driving scenes don't make much sense and are equally bad.
9974,tt0780595,7137,4,"If you get really bothered by movies where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster, save yourself the trouble and money."
9975,tt0780595,7137,5,Good movie for racing fans.
9976,tt0780595,7137,6,"Well, there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a NASCAR driver as a rally car driver."
9977,tt0780595,7137,7,"If you can't tell the difference, go watch it, you'll have a blast."
9978,tt0780595,7137,8,"It really comes down to this, there are really really really nice cars in this movie, they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic."
9979,tt0780595,7137,9,The acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot.
9980,tt0780595,7137,10,"If you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead."
9981,tt0780595,7137,11,I am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie.
9982,tt0780595,7137,12,"If the class of the cars were to match that of the movie, they should be racing with rusted bicycles."
9983,tt0780595,7138,1,Acting is horrible.
9984,tt0780595,7138,2,This film makes Fast and Furious look like an academy award winning film.
9985,tt0780595,7138,3,They throw a few boobs and butts in there to try and keep you interested despite the EXTREMELY weak and far fetched story.
9986,tt0780595,7138,4,There is a reason why people on the internet aren't even downloading this movie.
9987,tt0780595,7138,5,This movie sunk like an iron turd.
9988,tt0780595,7138,6,DO NOT waste your time renting or even downloading it.
9989,tt0780595,7138,7,This film is and always will be a PERMA TURD.
9990,tt0780595,7138,8,I am now dumber for having watched it.
9991,tt0780595,7138,9,"In fact this title should be referred to as a ""PERMA TURD"" from now on."
9992,tt0780595,7138,10,"Calling it a film is a travesty and insult. abhorrent, abominable, appalling, awful, beastly, cruel, detestable, disagreeable, disgusting, dreadful, eerie, execrable, fairy, fearful, frightful, ghastly, grim, grisly, gruesome, heinous, hideous, horrendous, horrid, loathsome, lousy, lurid, mean, nasty, obnoxious, offensive, repellent, repulsive, revolting, scandalous, scary, shameful, shocking, sickie, terrible, terrifying, ungodly, unholy, unkind"
9993,tt0780595,7139,1,"Redline is a knockoff of Fast & Furious, without any of the redeeming qualities."
9994,tt0780595,7139,2,"It doesn't need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises, but it needs SOMETHING!"
9995,tt0780595,7139,3,"This is the equivalent of a porn film, where the storyline and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end."
9996,tt0780595,7139,4,"Except that this is worse, because you don't get your money's worth."
9997,tt0780595,7139,5,"Mind numbingly boring, impossible race sequences, and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars, which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie."
9998,tt0780595,7139,6,"Sure, she's hot, but who's that desperate for an on screen female."
9999,tt0780595,7139,7,"I feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets, and shook an 8 ball every time they switched scenes."
10000,tt0780595,7139,8,No serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes.
10001,tt0780595,7140,1,You already know how painful to watch this movie is.
10002,tt0780595,7140,2,But I wonder why one of the worst movies ever should include one the most beautiful cars.
10003,tt0780595,7140,3,"Why the cars should be not only the victim of violation, but also the only true actors and performers in it."
10004,tt0780595,7140,4,"So how on Earth you Porsche, Lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give millions."
10005,tt0780595,7140,5,Stop the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their chests.
10006,tt0780595,7140,6,It is painful for those who love cars.
10007,tt0780595,7140,7,It is painful for those who love movies.
10008,tt0780595,7140,8,I want my money back !!!
10009,tt0780595,7141,1,Okay so I went into this movie not really expecting much I figured an action flick similar to The Fast and the Furious.
10010,tt0780595,7141,2,Some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot.
10011,tt0780595,7141,3,Unfortunately I would have to say that this was probably the worst movie I have seen this year.
10012,tt0780595,7141,4,Don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were OK but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely.
10013,tt0780595,7141,5,The story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together.
10014,tt0780595,7141,6,So overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend I would pass on this one for now.
10015,tt0780595,7142,1,This is by far the WORST movie I have ever seen.
10016,tt0780595,7142,2,I was going in expecting a cheesy movie but at least with some cool car scenes/races.
10017,tt0780595,7142,3,What I got was nothing.
10018,tt0780595,7142,4,"The racing scene are so low budget they sped them up to make it look like the cars are ""going fast"" In one scene a Mercedes SLR goes from over 200 to 0 in like 4 seconds by just spinning around in circles."
10019,tt0780595,7142,5,Its just ridiculous.
10020,tt0780595,7142,6,"If you wanna see a real movie about cars, see the fast and the furious series."
10021,tt0780595,7142,7,"They may be a little cheesy, but 100x better than this movie could ever hope to be."
10022,tt0780595,7142,8,"Better yet just watch Mischief 3000, the best car movie ever made I think."
10023,tt0780595,7143,1,"This movie has some of the most awesome cars I've ever seen in a movie, and definitely the hottest women, but I would have to say it is still one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
10024,tt0780595,7143,2,"Here is the plot, and if you read it with a little inflection, you have the acting as well."
10025,tt0780595,7143,3,"Beginning, bring in characters, hot woman singing obvious lip sync."
10026,tt0780595,7143,4,"Music agent or producer comes in, thinks that she is awesome asks her to race."
10027,tt0780595,7143,5,"She turns down, too many bad memories."
10028,tt0780595,7143,6,"Flash to war hero, back from war, has several fights, and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone."
10029,tt0780595,7143,7,Drive off in fast exotic car.
10030,tt0780595,7143,8,"Brother races, then dies."
10031,tt0780595,7143,9,"Hero to avenge death, cut away to getting weapons from friend."
10032,tt0780595,7143,10,"You have never seen this friend before or after, but seems to really care about him Are you sure you want to do this; Yes; I mean are you really sure; Yes, give me weapons; are you REALLY sure; Yes; OK, I guess I can't talk you out of it, be careful man, I love you."
10033,tt0780595,7143,11,Now he goes to blow up his uncles house who owned the car his brother drove.
10034,tt0780595,7143,12,"Finds woman, decides to rescue her, She drives off, and he doesn't finish killing his uncle."
10035,tt0780595,7143,13,Now there will be a race to finish the movie.
10036,tt0780595,7143,14,"Oh yeah, need to throw in one more scene with bad people coming in to beat up people that don't really matter, but maybe it adds a little plot."
10037,tt0780595,7143,15,"Race is not even that exciting, of course it ends with two cars racing, and one that should win throws in a surprise ending."
10038,tt0780595,7143,16,"OK, I just saved you $7.00."
10039,tt0780595,7143,17,"You can send all of your money to me, because I should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does."
10040,tt0780595,7143,18,"Don't get me wrong, the cars are awesome, and Nadija is beautiful, but it is truly an awful movie."
10041,tt0780595,7144,1,"It was almost worth sitting through this entire god awful ""film"" just to know that I can never experience anything as bad as this again."
10042,tt0780595,7144,2,"Acting 0, script 0, fight scenes 0, male lead 0 cheddar bob from eight mile as a suave war hero who gets the girl, Nadia Bjorlin 10 She is gorgeous and not a terrible actress."
10043,tt0780595,7144,3,This is the criteria I used to average it out to a two.
10044,tt0780595,7144,4,"I lost count but I believe ever movie clich√©, ever, is in this movie."
10045,tt0780595,7144,5,"When the driver that supposedly killed her father miraculously shows up at the end to race against her, from out of nowhere it cemented the previous statement."
10046,tt0780595,7144,6,Plus he just shows up for no reason.
10047,tt0780595,7144,7,He was never even mentioned before.
10048,tt0780595,7144,8,I don't know what else to say here.
10049,tt0780595,7144,9,Just watch it when it comes out on TV in a couple years.
10050,tt0780595,7144,10,At least that way some of it will be edited out for commercials.
10051,tt0780595,7145,1,Apparently Hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak.
10052,tt0780595,7145,2,This movie was mind numbingly bad.
10053,tt0780595,7145,3,"The casting was terrible, the acting unspeakable, and the story filled with holes."
10054,tt0780595,7145,4,Script. who needs script.
10055,tt0780595,7145,5,"I was surprised that the movie wasn't as verbally vulgar as I thought it would be, however I got enough shots of T&A to last me a lifetime."
10056,tt0780595,7145,6,The movie was like listening to a 19 year old street racer with ADD who decided to buy a car instead of go to college tell a story.
10057,tt0780595,7145,7,"Being so poorly scripted, I thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first."
10058,tt0780595,7145,8,"The scenes at the racetrack, along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of Herbie: Fully Loaded."
10059,tt0780595,7145,9,This is the kind of film is what Grindhouse modeled itself after...only the writers thought they were being serious.
10060,tt0780595,7146,1,"I registered just to make this comment which pretty much echos some of the ones here already The acting is worse than subpar, it expounds on commonly held stereotypes, has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification all bod no brain, and has some of the cheesiest lines known to man.including but not limited to ""allright lets see what these guys can do"" I should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves."
10061,tt0780595,7146,2,Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way.
10062,tt0780595,7146,3,He may or may not be a good actor but this movie doesn't allow for that kind of character exploration.
10063,tt0780595,7146,4,You want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys.
10064,tt0780595,7146,5,Oceans 11.
10065,tt0780595,7146,6,This movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience.
10066,tt0780595,7146,7,Even the cars can't make up for this fluke of a movie.
10067,tt0780595,7146,8,That Enzo that Griffin wrecked sums up this movie perfectly.
10068,tt0780595,7146,9,It just sucks.
10069,tt0780595,7147,1,My Favorite part was when the credits started to roll.
10070,tt0780595,7147,2,I wish I could give it a .0000000000001 out of 10.
10071,tt0780595,7147,3,I really wish I had that Hour and thirty minutes back.
10072,tt0780595,7147,4,Don't waste your money or time on it.
10073,tt0780595,7147,5,I really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards.
10074,tt0780595,7147,6,Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie didn't destroy her career.
10075,tt0780595,7147,7,But she chose to be in it.
10076,tt0780595,7147,8,All in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked.
10077,tt0780595,7147,9,More than Kazaam and Glitter combined.
10078,tt0780595,7147,10,That's saying something.
10079,tt0780595,7147,11,Don'tDoit!!!!
10080,tt0780595,7148,1,Before watching this film I had very low expectations and went to just see the cars.
10081,tt0780595,7148,2,Eventually I even regretted going for that reason.
10082,tt0780595,7148,3,Plot is almost non existent.
10083,tt0780595,7148,4,Character development is non existent.
10084,tt0780595,7148,5,So many clich√©s and so much jaw dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that I could only stare and wonder how it was even released.
10085,tt0780595,7148,6,"If not for the exotics, I wouldn't have even rated this movie a 1."
10086,tt0780595,7148,7,An attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members.
10087,tt0780595,7148,8,"In fact, the movie's plot is so predictable and simple minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline."
10088,tt0780595,7148,9,"Bad acting, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie."
10089,tt0780595,7148,10,Don't see it.
10090,tt0780595,7148,11,Play Gran Turismo HD instead and it'll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste.
10091,tt0780595,7149,1,"Whoever wrote up ""Redline"" as a great car movie must be getting paid off by Daniel Sadek to promote this ultra crappy flaming, steaming pile of amateur crap."
10092,tt0780595,7149,2,Easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made.
10093,tt0780595,7149,3,This makes Showgirls look like Citizen Kane.
10094,tt0780595,7149,4,"Take every cheesy clich√© out of an 80s action TV series, put in some really crappy special effects and lame characters with no relevance and you have living proof that Daniel Sadek should not write screenplays and produce movies but should remain in the real estate business."
10095,tt0780595,7149,5,This is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequences ever.
10096,tt0780595,7149,6,What offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap.
10097,tt0780595,7150,1,After seeing the previews I felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast & furious series.
10098,tt0780595,7150,2,"So, I already expected it to have a lacking storyline, but at least this time it won't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans."
10099,tt0780595,7150,3,"Unfortunately, I was wrong."
10100,tt0780595,7150,4,If you could only imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you.
10101,tt0780595,7150,5,This is the absolute worst movie I had ever seen I'm being nice no I would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said.
10102,tt0780595,7150,6,"Not only was the storyline non existent, but the action was crap too."
10103,tt0780595,7150,7,I guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie.
10104,tt0780595,7150,8,"For an example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a SLR McLaren to win."
10105,tt0780595,7150,9,"And after the bit where Eddy Griffin got in a fight with one of his ""girls"" an Imus comment would work in this case the girl asks to pull over and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert."
10106,tt0780595,7150,10,After this wonderful scene I couldn't take it anymore.
10107,tt0780595,7150,11,"So, I only got to see half of this monstrosity."
10108,tt0780595,7150,12,This is the first movie I had ever walked out on.
10109,tt0780595,7150,13,"Afterwards, I had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells."
10110,tt0780595,7150,14,I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option.
10111,tt0780595,7150,15,You're better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home.
10112,tt0780595,7150,16,I will keep all viewers in my prayers.
10113,tt0780595,7151,1,Im proud to say I've seen all three Fast and Furious films.
10114,tt0780595,7151,2,"Sure,the plots are kinda silly,and they might be a little cheesy,but I love them car chases,and all the beautiful cars,and the clandestine midnight races."
10115,tt0780595,7151,3,And Ill gladly see a fourth one.
10116,tt0780595,7151,4,Wanna know what the difference is between those three and Redline.
10117,tt0780595,7151,5,"Decent acting,somewhat thought out plot,even if they are potboilers,and last but not least,directors who have a clue."
10118,tt0780595,7151,6,"All three were made by very competent directors,all of them took the films in a different direction,equally exciting."
10119,tt0780595,7151,7,"Redline looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch,and made them the extras,then picked up his leads from Hollywood's unemployment line."
10120,tt0780595,7151,8,And the script.
10121,tt0780595,7151,9,Yikes.
10122,tt0780595,7151,10,Its Mystery Science Theatre 3000 bad.
10123,tt0780595,7151,11,This is 70's made for TV movie bad.
10124,tt0780595,7151,12,"Yeah,the movie had a few cool cars,but you don't really get to see that many in action,and the action is directed so poorly you cant get excited by the chases,and if the cars aren't thrilling you,why go to a movie like this."
10125,tt0780595,7151,13,"Im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers,and I cant stop laughing out loud."
10126,tt0780595,7151,14,"Im getting dirty looks,but this was just a debacle."
10127,tt0780595,7151,15,Rent the F&F movies.
10128,tt0780595,7151,16,Go to Nascar Race.
10129,tt0780595,7151,17,Go to a karting track and race yourself.
10130,tt0780595,7151,18,"Whatever you do,avoid Redline like bad cheese."
10131,tt0179443,11263,1,"For shame, for shame that a fine actor such as Joseph Fiennes would allow himself to be cast in this piece of nauseating drivel."
10132,tt0179443,11263,2,"The movie was not only bad, but down right horrible and of no redeeming quality."
10133,tt0179443,11263,3,"The plot, was there one. seemed to go no where."
10134,tt0179443,11263,4,The Russians played silly kill or be killed games and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances.
10135,tt0179443,11263,5,I gave up about 3/4 of the way through and turned it off.
10136,tt0179443,11263,6,"A ""1"" for awful only because there is nothing lower."
10137,tt0179443,11263,7,"Don't waste your time on this one, you'll not miss anything."
10138,tt0179443,11264,1,"I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as ""The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen""."
10139,tt0179443,11264,2,"Even if you ignore the dodgy accents, low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it."
10140,tt0179443,11264,3,I only went to see it as I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film.
10141,tt0179443,11264,4,The simple answer is they didn't.
10142,tt0179443,11264,5,Characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative.
10143,tt0179443,11264,6,Even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it's climax you don't care what happens to any of them.
10144,tt0179443,11264,7,I can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from.
10145,tt0179443,11264,8,But after my friends and I came out of the cinema I had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened.
10146,tt0179443,11264,9,"They even change the true meaning of the books title ""Rancid Aluminium"" by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title."
10147,tt0179443,11264,10,A real mess of a film from start to finish.
10148,tt0179443,11265,1,"There have been some low moments in my life, when I have been bewildered and depressed."
10149,tt0179443,11265,2,Sitting through Rancid Aluminium was one of these.
10150,tt0179443,11265,3,The warning signs were there.
10151,tt0179443,11265,4,No premiere even the stars didn't want to attend and no reviews in magazines.
10152,tt0179443,11265,5,The only reason I sat through the film was in the hope that I might catch up on some sleep.
10153,tt0179443,11265,6,Nothing in the film was explained.
10154,tt0179443,11265,7,The narration was idiotic.
10155,tt0179443,11265,8,"I cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot, then to my growing despair, it was revealed that he hadn't really been shot dampening my joy."
10156,tt0179443,11265,9,I sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity.
10157,tt0179443,11265,10,"There were some positive aspects, mainly unintentional moments of humour."
10158,tt0179443,11265,11,"For example, the scene in which the main character, for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle, while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears."
10159,tt0179443,11265,12,"My words cannot explain the anger I feel, so I shall conclude thus."
10160,tt0179443,11265,13,"Rancid Aluminium: for sadists, wastrels, and regressives only who want to torture themselves."
10161,tt0179443,11266,1,"Well, what to say..."
10162,tt0179443,11266,2,Having seen the film I still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was..
10163,tt0179443,11266,3,V.Dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point...
10164,tt0179443,11266,4,"I had to look away from the screen, I was feeling physically sick..."
10165,tt0179443,11266,5,Round and Round and Round....
10166,tt0179443,11266,6,You get the idea...
10167,tt0179443,11266,7,VERY VERY Strange accents at many points....
10168,tt0179443,11266,8,"""Those that should know, know""Unless your getting in for free, or being paid to watch it, or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something.. then forget it..."
10169,tt0179443,11267,1,Okay.
10170,tt0179443,11267,2,So there aren't really that many great movies around.
10171,tt0179443,11267,3,"Recent gems like American Dream, The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 don't normally come so close together."
10172,tt0179443,11267,4,But boy !
10173,tt0179443,11267,5,does this film counter balance the quality.
10174,tt0179443,11267,6,I have NO idea what these people thought they were doing.
10175,tt0179443,11267,7,Are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to fund such a crock of .
10176,tt0179443,11267,8,I can just see it now...
10177,tt0179443,11267,9,"Producer ""So we've got Joe Fiennes."
10178,tt0179443,11267,10,He's cute as a button and was pretty good in Shakespeare in Love.
10179,tt0179443,11267,11,"And we've got Rhys Ifans, who isn't cute but was cool in Notting Hill."
10180,tt0179443,11267,12,"We'll mix in a really mediocre score, a few forgettable post Britpop tunes, hemlock root and lizard brains and hey presto you've got the worst film of the new millennium."
10181,tt0179443,11267,13,"And believe me, it's gonna be a hard job to make anything as bad as this in the next thousand years."""
10182,tt0179443,11267,14,"The Bank ""I like it!"
10183,tt0179443,11267,15,Any unnecessary sex.
10184,tt0179443,11267,16,Bad camera movements.
10185,tt0179443,11267,17,"And what about the worst accents this side of Devil's Own."""
10186,tt0179443,11267,18,"Producer ""Yeah, we got plenty of those."""
10187,tt0179443,11267,19,"The Bank ""Sounds great, where do we sign."""
10188,tt0179443,11267,20,Please.
10189,tt0179443,11268,1,I was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable.
10190,tt0179443,11268,2,The plot was weak to say the least.
10191,tt0179443,11268,3,I was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up I wonder if any of them will include this on their CVs..
10192,tt0179443,11268,4,At least I didn't pay to rent it.
10193,tt0179443,11268,5,"The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the film is complete and utter PANTS."
10194,tt0179443,11269,1,"Must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time, but this one is up there with the worst of them."
10195,tt0179443,11269,2,Plot troubling to follow.
10196,tt0179443,11269,3,Sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film.
10197,tt0179443,11269,4,I can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two.
10198,tt0179443,11269,5,"Sadly, in my case, I have the DVD."
10199,tt0179443,11269,6,It will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
10200,tt0179443,11270,1,I have seen bad films but this took the p.
10201,tt0179443,11270,2,"Made no sense, and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds, oh and i think one has a low sperm count."
10202,tt0179443,11270,3,Its that good.
10203,tt0179443,11270,4,A welshman plays a sweary cockney.
10204,tt0179443,11270,5,"A posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy, and some lesser lights play dim tarts."
10205,tt0179443,11270,6,And there are some Russian gangsters.
10206,tt0179443,11270,7,Oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs.
10207,tt0179443,11270,8,Avoid this film like the plague.
10208,tt0179443,11271,1,We know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie.
10209,tt0179443,11271,2,A waste of time.
10210,tt0179443,11271,3,The premise was not too bad.
10211,tt0179443,11271,4,But one workable idea interaction between real bussinessmen and Russian mafia is not followed by an intelligent script
10212,tt0179443,11272,1,...the first film I had to walk out on.
10213,tt0179443,11272,2,"And it was the cast and crew pre screening Not that I was involved, I hasten to add."
10214,tt0179443,11272,3,"I made it through the first hour, so I reckon I'm just qualified to comment, but that was my limit."
10215,tt0179443,11272,4,"Like other comments here, how did this get through any kind of QA."
10216,tt0179443,11272,5,"An accumulation of the very worst in dialogue, the epitome of wooden acting, awful casting, all wrapped together without a plot."
10217,tt0179443,11272,6,"Tara Fitzgerald's casting was bizarre, almost comic."
10218,tt0179443,11272,7,She possesses the worst Russian accent in movie history.
10219,tt0179443,11272,8,"As I left the screening, the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema."
10220,tt0179443,11272,9,They obviously couldn't sit through it again either.
10221,tt0179443,11273,1,How can you gather this respectable cast of young British actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure.
10222,tt0179443,11273,2,"Horrible script, annoyingly hectic camera, awfully edited, gruesomely badly acted."
10223,tt0179443,11273,3,Only Rhys Ifans tries to fill his role with life.
10224,tt0179443,11273,4,"Another painful proof that ""different"" sometimes equals ""dreck""."
10225,tt0179443,11273,5,Why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand.
10226,tt0179443,11273,6,Do yourself a favour: spare yourself and do something else like hitting a mallet onto your knees.
10227,tt0179443,11273,7,It's less painful and more fun than this movie!
10228,tt0179443,11274,1,"Just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film, I decided to write another review."
10229,tt0179443,11274,2,I missed a few things out last time...
10230,tt0179443,11274,3,"First, the script."
10231,tt0179443,11274,4,"Second, the acting."
10232,tt0179443,11274,5,"Third, Jesus Christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when Joseph Fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting climax!!!"
10233,tt0179443,11274,6,I can't believe I wasted my money on this when I could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or SOMETHING!
10234,tt0179443,11274,7,Are you getting the picture.
10235,tt0179443,11275,1,This is a truly abysmal `LOCK STOCK' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script.
10236,tt0179443,11275,2,"I have no idea why so many top British actors signed up to this junk, they must have been bribed."
10237,tt0179443,11275,3,A miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if I hadn't have paid good money for it I'd have turned it off after 10 minutes.
10238,tt0179443,11275,4,"Not the worst film ive ever seen, that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a ¬ëmovie' I use the term loosely `GUMMO' I feel like suing that so called `director' for the lost hour and a half of my life but this trash is nearly right down there with it."
10239,tt0179443,11275,5,Definitely one of the worst 5 films I have ever seen.
10240,tt0179443,11275,6,Stuff like this reminds Hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on truly awful films.
10241,tt0179443,11276,1,I shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad.
10242,tt0179443,11276,2,"That has been done in great detail already, many times over."
10243,tt0179443,11276,3,The 'plot' started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide boy/gangster by numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles.
10244,tt0179443,11276,4,Anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves.
10245,tt0179443,11276,5,"It is now 7 or 8 years since I watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled, yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film I have ever seen."
10246,tt0179443,11276,6,"I am only making these comments, and indeed the only reason I went to see the film, is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second 'heavy' in the pub scene."
10247,tt0179443,11276,7,It was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan's face in the bar in 'Russia' it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island.
10248,tt0179443,11276,8,My brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever he had recently joined an extras' agency and this was his first part.
10249,tt0179443,11276,9,"Having seen the film, it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever."
10250,tt0179443,11276,10,I remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema and this was just a couple of days after it had been released.
10251,tt0179443,11276,11,I have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast and rightly so.
10252,tt0179443,11276,12,"In case you were thinking of renting this film on DVD, I would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red hot, then jam them into your eye sockets."
10253,tt0179443,11276,13,This will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film.
10254,tt0179443,11277,1,There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn't help with the major downsides to the movie.
10255,tt0179443,11277,2,I never understand why directors ask actors/actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can't convince.
10256,tt0179443,11277,3,Fiennes just can't do Irish and Fitzgerald isn't much better at Russian.
10257,tt0179443,11277,4,When the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing.
10258,tt0179443,11277,5,As the for the major problem....the plot....was there one.
10259,tt0179443,11277,6,I guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that I just couldn't wait for the film to end...it was ridiculous.
10260,tt0179443,11277,7,Save 90 minutes of your life and don't watch this movie!
10261,tt0179443,11278,1,this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the British film industry but the talentless hacks at work today.
10262,tt0179443,11278,2,"Not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of British actors, so what went wrong. i don't know and simply i don't care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all. be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish. but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot."
10263,tt0179443,11278,3,"A nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co worker out of his father's company and thus leads to an encounter with the Russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid, very stupid plot twists/devices. i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience. if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather, what about lock, stock.... thats the peak of the contemporary British crime film....."
10264,tt0179443,11279,1,Words really can't describe how bad this film is.
10265,tt0179443,11279,2,"I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off."
10266,tt0179443,11279,3,This is just laughable!
10267,tt0179443,11279,4,"Terrible script, poor direction, awful acting and you know what."
10268,tt0179443,11279,5,I can't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn't too long.
10269,tt0179443,11279,6,"If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment, book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work far more enjoyable and much better value for money assuming that you need it!."
10270,tt0179443,11279,7,"Incidentally, I need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE."
10271,tt0179443,11279,8,IT IS TERRIBLE!
10272,tt0179443,11280,1,This film is about a man's life going wrong.
10273,tt0179443,11280,2,"His business is failing, and he cannot impregnate his wife despite multiple attempts."
10274,tt0179443,11280,3,The plot is complete chaos.
10275,tt0179443,11280,4,It simply does not make sense.
10276,tt0179443,11280,5,"In fact, nothing in the film makes sense."
10277,tt0179443,11280,6,The story is so poorly told that I simply could not understand it.
10278,tt0179443,11280,7,"It is a shame, because the sets and costumes are done well, and are visually stimulating enough."
10279,tt0179443,11280,8,The shots are well composed throughout the film.
10280,tt0179443,11280,9,"However, these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling."
10281,tt0179443,11280,10,I am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film.
10282,tt0179443,11280,11,It is such a waste of their talents.
10283,tt0179443,11280,12,This film is very bad.
10284,tt0179443,11280,13,Avoid it!!
10285,tt0179443,11281,1,I have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in Russia.
10286,tt0179443,11281,2,"In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line ""50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk"", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could, so I declined to take this speaking part on."
10287,tt0179443,11281,3,"I was slightly starstruck as this was my first Film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as ""I'll be Back"" and ""Quite Frankly My Dear, I Don't Give a Damn""."
10288,tt0179443,11281,4,Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski.
10289,tt0179443,11281,5,"As time goes on, I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film."
10290,tt0179443,11281,6,"Even though I spent a whole day on the set, in South Wales hot spot Barry Island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was."
10291,tt0179443,11281,7,The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if I'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films....
10292,tt0179443,11281,8,Still.....
10293,tt0179443,11281,9,On the positive side....
10294,tt0179443,11281,10,I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break.
10295,tt0179443,11281,11,"I had no idea who he was, as ""Notting Hill"" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be Welsh."
10296,tt0179443,11281,12,Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s.
10297,tt0179443,11281,13,It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realised I was in a quality production........
10298,tt0179443,11282,1,"In the wake of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, the British film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late '90s early '00s that seem even more desperate today than they did then."
10299,tt0179443,11282,2,"In one of the all time great cases of pearls from swine, the producers of Rancid Aluminium brazenly plastered the quote 'The best film of the century' from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because, at the time of writing, it was the only film that had been released in 2000."
10300,tt0179443,11282,3,"Looking at it today it's hard to imagine how it ever got made, uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of Cool Britannia's Lads Mags Brigade ¬ñ Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, Nick Moran and Joseph Fiennes ¬ñ but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused James Hawes novel."
10301,tt0179443,11282,4,"That the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no one really knows what it is, or perhaps simply don't think it matters."
10302,tt0179443,11282,5,"Something to do with Ifans' businessman being set up with Steven Berkoff's homicidal Russian crime lord in a money laundering or investment scheme it's never clear which because no one ever asks by Fiennes' crooked Irish accountant, who expects the Russians to kill off Ifans so he can take over his failing company."
10303,tt0179443,11282,6,"Things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on, Ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and Tara Fitzgerald's ludicrously accented Russian temptress, Berkoff keeps on saying ""Bizniss"" and ""Francis Drake"" and Fiennes does a decent Irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in Shakespeare in Love doesn't mean he's any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts."
10304,tt0179443,11282,7,"When the most convincing performances come from Keith Allen and Dani Behr, you know a film is in deep trouble."
10305,tt0179443,11282,8,"With Poland standing in for a Russia filled with people with Polish accents and a strange score that veers from John Barry pastiche to lounge music to Ennio Morricone spaghetti Western on a stylophone budget, it fails completely in the cool stakes it's aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own, sitting there like a joke shop dog turd."
10306,tt0179443,11283,1,"I felt Rancid Aluminium was a complete waste of two hours, the plot line was thin and confusing, the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents."
10307,tt0179443,11283,2,"The camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey, it just made it even more difficult to watch."
10308,tt0179443,11283,3,One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience.
10309,tt0179443,11283,4,The best performances weren't anything to do with acting.
10310,tt0179443,11283,5,"In fact probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people, although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary."
10311,tt0179443,11283,6,"DO NOT under any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash."
10312,tt0179443,11284,1,"I usually try to construct reasonably well argued critiques of films, but I can not believe this got past the script stage."
10313,tt0179443,11284,2,"The dialogue is appalling, the acting very dodgy, the accents just awful, and the direction and pacing is scrappy at best."
10314,tt0179443,11284,3,I don't remember the last time I saw a film quite this bad.
10315,tt0179443,11284,4,"Joseph Fiennes, pretty as he is, might just have killed his career as quickly as it started."
10316,tt0179443,11284,5,The Island of Doctor Moreau was no worse than this garbage.
10317,tt0179443,11285,1,I read James Hawes book.
10318,tt0179443,11285,2,"It was pretty neat, not great, but entertaining enough."
10319,tt0179443,11285,3,"Without having read the book I wouldn't have had the slightest idea what was going on, and it was still a stretch with that knowledge."
10320,tt0179443,11285,4,Literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways I do not have the capacity to describe.
10321,tt0179443,11285,5,Half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick.
10322,tt0179443,11285,6,Never before or since as a film made me feel so angry.
10323,tt0179443,11285,7,"The Mattress sequels came closest, but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did."
10324,tt0179443,11285,8,Since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind I am now unable to even look at any book by James Hawes without feeling angry.
10325,tt0179443,11285,9,That is the depth of hatred I have for this piece of sht.
10326,tt0179443,11285,10,"No, that's unfair."
10327,tt0179443,11285,11,Let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil that is Rancid Aluminium.
10328,tt0179443,11285,12,Plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema.
10329,tt0179443,11286,1,Where do you begin with a movie as bad as this.
10330,tt0179443,11286,2,Do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes.
10331,tt0179443,11286,3,The over the top acting.
10332,tt0179443,11286,4,The dreadful script.
10333,tt0179443,11286,5,No.
10334,tt0179443,11286,6,You just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at.
10335,tt0179443,11286,7,I know I do.
10336,tt0179443,11286,8,I respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like Empire usually a bad sign if a preview copy isn't available to the quality movie mags.
10337,tt0179443,11286,9,"However, cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer isn't happy with the finished product."
10338,tt0179443,11286,10,I went three days after it opened with two other mates.
10339,tt0179443,11286,11,The only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own.
10340,tt0179443,11286,12,And that was on cheap night.
10341,tt0179443,11286,13,Either the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is.
10342,tt0179443,11286,14,Not since the days of The Avengers 1998 have I felt so short changed since watching a movie.
10343,tt0179443,11286,15,If a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it.
10344,tt0179443,11286,16,"Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up or walking off the set; Keith Allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage; Barry Foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance, Rhys Ifans does his career no favours after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary."
10345,tt0179443,11286,17,"Mind you, considering she used to be in The Word, any viewers' expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with."
10346,tt0179443,11286,18,The production values aren't bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious.
10347,tt0179443,11286,19,"If you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say ""Fak!"""
10348,tt0179443,11286,20,for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street.
10349,tt0179443,11286,21,"Otherwise, bargepoles required."
10350,tt0179443,11287,1,"This is a film that had a lot to live down to . on the year of its release legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and I'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated To be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word "" plot "" is used because as far as I can see there is no plot as such ."
10351,tt0179443,11287,2,"There's something involving Russian gangsters , a character called Pete Thompson who's trying to get his wife Sarah pregnant , and an Irish bloke called Sean ."
10352,tt0179443,11287,3,"How they all fit into something called a "" plot "" I'm not sure ."
10353,tt0179443,11287,4,It's difficult to explain the plots of Guy Ritchie films but if you watch any of his films I'm sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing .
10354,tt0179443,11287,5,Likewise a James Bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes .
10355,tt0179443,11287,6,You will have a serious problem believing RANCID ALUMINIUM has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained Taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you'll be watching .
10356,tt0179443,11287,7,Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and she's doing nothing to become inconsistent .
10357,tt0179443,11287,8,Steven Berkoff gives acting a bad name and he plays a character called Kant which sums up the wit of this movie while one of the supporting characters is played by a TV presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's utterly forgettable .
10358,tt0179443,11287,9,"I saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching I was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching , but by now I've mainly forgotten why ."
10359,tt0179443,11287,10,But this doesn't alter the fact that I remember disliking this piece of crap immensely
10360,tt0326820,11133,1,"Except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads, this movie is really, really bad."
10361,tt0326820,11133,2,The cheap production values don't help.
10362,tt0326820,11133,3,"Of course, you wouldn't really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn't keep trying to convince you they HAD a production values to begin with."
10363,tt0326820,11133,4,"Even for a B movie genre freak like myself, this movie really sucks."
10364,tt0326820,11134,1,This is a very cheaply made werewolf flick.
10365,tt0326820,11134,2,The video is dark and poorly lit.
10366,tt0326820,11134,3,The audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed.
10367,tt0326820,11134,4,The script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun!
10368,tt0326820,11134,5,filled of course with silver bullets.
10369,tt0326820,11134,6,The acting is as wooden as the characters.
10370,tt0326820,11134,7,"The FX are non existent,lots of extreme close ups of werewolf jaws and biting. the only thing that is shown is lots of soft core T&A."
10371,tt0326820,11134,8,"Instead of dropping $30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic: ""Dog Soldiers"" with Sean Pertwee."
10372,tt0326820,11135,1,What more can I say.
10373,tt0326820,11135,2,"The acting was, almost without exception, amateurish."
10374,tt0326820,11135,3,The directing and continuity were pitiful.
10375,tt0326820,11135,4,The sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious.
10376,tt0326820,11135,5,"One of the features on the DVD was labeled ""Gag Reel"" but that could have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the movie."
10377,tt0326820,11135,6,One of the most amusing things was in the director's comments on the DVD.
10378,tt0326820,11135,7,"He said, with a straight face, that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast and that he had succeeded."
10379,tt0326820,11135,8,With delusions like that it's easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did.
10380,tt0326820,11135,9,Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster.
10381,tt0326820,11135,10,The darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit per the 'making of' feature on the DVD and rather looked it.
10382,tt0326820,11135,11,The mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store.
10383,tt0326820,11135,12,The cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game.
10384,tt0326820,11136,1,This is only the second time I've felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film.
10385,tt0326820,11136,2,The first time was for probably the best movie I've ever seen and that was for Memento.
10386,tt0326820,11136,3,"Seeing Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst film I've had the misfortune to see."
10387,tt0326820,11136,4,Apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash pile that it is.
10388,tt0326820,11136,5,"Let's see, apalling effects, cliched script, bad acting and about 90 minutes too long."
10389,tt0326820,11136,6,My wife and I laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad.
10390,tt0326820,11136,7,"Amazingly I watched it to the end, how I did that I don't know!"
10391,tt0326820,11136,8,AVOID!!!
10392,tt0326820,11137,1,All the bare chested women in the world couldn't keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish.
10393,tt0326820,11137,2,"With the derisory acting, equally terrible script plus the poor CGI FX to match; this movie is an insult to the Werewolf genre."
10394,tt0326820,11137,3,"It is supposed to be serious, which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad joke."
10395,tt0326820,11137,4,This is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent.
10396,tt0326820,11137,5,Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic Werewolf movies instead.0 out of 10!
10397,tt0326820,11138,1,Let me start by saying that I'd read a number of reviews before renting this film and kind of knew what to expect.
10398,tt0326820,11138,2,"Still, I was surprised by just how bad it was."
10399,tt0326820,11138,3,"I am a big werewolf fan, and have grown accustomed to forgiving a great deal when watching one."
10400,tt0326820,11138,4,"Most of them have sub par effects, poor acting, and weak storylines at best rehashed from earlier films."
10401,tt0326820,11138,5,"So far, with the possible exception of some of the later ""Howling"" series films, this is the worst of the lot."
10402,tt0326820,11138,6,"First, the story."
10403,tt0326820,11138,7,"It's been quoted several times in reviews on this site, so I won't go into specifics."
10404,tt0326820,11138,8,"However, it is very obvious that the writers had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters."
10405,tt0326820,11138,9,"As so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves ""above"" such fare, they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mythos."
10406,tt0326820,11138,10,"That's fine, but a non horror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them."
10407,tt0326820,11138,11,"The plot feels like a parody of werewolf films, and the events depicted just ring so false that I felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted."
10408,tt0326820,11138,12,"TV news footage, for example, never pans away from the reporter to close up on someone in the crowd behind them."
10409,tt0326820,11138,13,Give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon sign.
10410,tt0326820,11138,14,And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
10411,tt0326820,11138,15,"As for effects, I have NEVER seen a less believable werewolf."
10412,tt0326820,11138,16,I'd have been happier with Lon Chaney Jr. in crepe hair.
10413,tt0326820,11138,17,"The beast they used look a great deal like... well, like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful animatronics."
10414,tt0326820,11138,18,"And, I know that many people have already criticized the CG, but my God it was awful."
10415,tt0326820,11138,19,"One scene features a woman changing, and starts with a completely CG version of the actress, nude but for some reason without nipples."
10416,tt0326820,11138,20,"My first thought was, ""hey, why is one of the characters from 'ReBoot' turning into a silly looking werewolf."""
10417,tt0326820,11138,21,"Anyway, I like to look for positives in any film, and there were a few."
10418,tt0326820,11138,22,"The cinematography was passable the film was shot all digital, which is interesting and some of the performances were not terrible."
10419,tt0326820,11138,23,"It was also interesting seeing Tippi Hedron as the world's most well made up homeless woman, and Kane Hodder as the title bad guy."
10420,tt0326820,11138,24,"Also, the Yellow Power Ranger got all growed up and... well, damn."
10421,tt0326820,11138,25,"And if you're looking for skin, there's some pretty tasty examples."
10422,tt0326820,11138,26,This ends the male pig segment of the review.
10423,tt0326820,11138,27,"Overall, if you want a good werewolf film, try ""An American Werewolf in London"", the original ""The Howling"", ""Dog Soldiers"", or even ""The Wolfen"" though that one's got more wolf than were."
10424,tt0326820,11138,28,"If you're a lycanthrope completest, then take a gander."
10425,tt0326820,11138,29,"Otherwise, give this one a miss."
10426,tt0326820,11139,1,"There isn't much to say about this film, it is horrible."
10427,tt0326820,11139,2,"The acting and dialog are way far away from even decent, the story of the hybrid werewolf's is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there."
10428,tt0326820,11139,3,CGI is something you wouldn't like to see.
10429,tt0326820,11139,4,It so amateurish that it makes me vomit.
10430,tt0326820,11139,5,The only good thing on the DVD was in the Extras.
10431,tt0326820,11139,6,The gag reel.
10432,tt0326820,11139,7,"Everything else, just waste of time and money."
10433,tt0326820,11139,8,"I hope noone will buy this, this is not even worth renting."
10434,tt0326820,11139,9,Just stay away of this.
10435,tt0326820,11140,1,I thought I was going to watch a scary movie.. and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie.
10436,tt0326820,11140,2,In the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf I thought they was kidding.
10437,tt0326820,11140,3,Todays computer games have ten times better animations.
10438,tt0326820,11140,4,"Low budget, is a fitting comment."
10439,tt0326820,11140,5,I would recommend Wolf 1994 with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie.
10440,tt0326820,11140,6,It has good special effects as they should be human transforming to werewolf.
10441,tt0326820,11140,7,Unless you wish to have good laugh I would not recommend you to watch this movie.
10442,tt0326820,11140,8,This movie is a joke.
10443,tt0326820,11141,1,"Man, this movie sucked big time!"
10444,tt0326820,11141,2,I didn't even manage to see the hole thing my girlfriend did though.
10445,tt0326820,11141,3,"Really bad acting, computer animations so bad you just laugh woman to werewolf, strange clips, the list goes on and on."
10446,tt0326820,11141,4,Don't know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie.
10447,tt0326820,11141,5,And I don't mean all the naked ladys...
10448,tt0326820,11141,6,It's something about the light or something...
10449,tt0326820,11141,7,"This could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women, but not because it's an original movie white a nice plot twist."
10450,tt0326820,11141,8,My final words are: Don't see it!
10451,tt0326820,11141,9,It's not worth the time.
10452,tt0326820,11141,10,If you wanna see it because the nakedness there's lots of better ones to see!
10453,tt0326820,11142,1,This is the absolutely worst piece of crap I've ever had to watch actually it was so bad that I just HAD to watch it : The CGI is sooo bad it's fun!
10454,tt0326820,11142,2,"It's not even close to the shitty CGI animations in Spawn, that's how bad it is, har har har..."
10455,tt0326820,11142,3,"I'm amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on DVD, but I guess they'll get more money out of it that way, 'cos the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars."
10456,tt0326820,11142,4,It's so awful that a kindergarten class could have made it.
10457,tt0326820,11142,5,See it and laugh!
10458,tt0326820,11143,1,"Hi, I'm a friend of werewolf movies, and when i saw the title of Darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like ""hmm, simple and nice name to it at least."
10459,tt0326820,11143,2,"Althou... i wonder why i haven't heard of it before."""
10460,tt0326820,11143,3,"First of all, the movie starts with tits."
10461,tt0326820,11143,4,Lots of tits.
10462,tt0326820,11143,5,Tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to.
10463,tt0326820,11143,6,"Who cares about a werewolf effect, just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots!"
10464,tt0326820,11143,7,"So, about the mysterious darkwolf character a little spoilers ahead, but who really cares..."
10465,tt0326820,11143,8,He's your average everyday biker.
10466,tt0326820,11143,9,"Not even super tough looking, but like the old wise woman says in the movie ""he is far more powerful and dangerous than you've ever faced before."""
10467,tt0326820,11143,10,Just by describing her a tattooed biker type of a guy.
10468,tt0326820,11143,11,Pretty original.
10469,tt0326820,11143,12,"I even had look twice when they first used the ""red glowing eyes"" SPECIAL EFFECT!"
10470,tt0326820,11143,13,"I mean my god, that ""lets plant red dots on eyes with computer"" effect has been used since the seventies."
10471,tt0326820,11143,14,It looks plain ugly here!
10472,tt0326820,11143,15,And don't get me started with the werewolf 3D CGI.
10473,tt0326820,11143,16,"As said before, like an bad and old video game."
10474,tt0326820,11143,17,"And finally, as i do like werewolf films, like i said."
10475,tt0326820,11143,18,They prettymuch always build a werewolf legend of their own.
10476,tt0326820,11143,19,"Darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well, about some silly legends of hybrid werewolves and the ancient bloodline."
10477,tt0326820,11143,20,BUT.
10478,tt0326820,11143,21,"It almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement ""the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched"" starts random slashing."
10479,tt0326820,11143,22,"Which just doesn't make any sense, why even bother telling us the rules of killing, when they aren't even gonna play by them..."
10480,tt0326820,11143,23,"Aplus the wolf point of view shots are made with a sony handycam or something, filming mostly the floor and walls."
10481,tt0326820,11143,24,Just add growling noises and you've got a super werewolf effect.
10482,tt0326820,11143,25,The gore is partially OK.
10483,tt0326820,11143,26,"But when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand, just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims, it just doesn't do the trick for me..."
10484,tt0326820,11143,27,"Truly, WHO gives money to make these heaps of junk straight to video horrortitles, they aren't even funny kind of bad movies, just sad."
10485,tt0326820,11144,1,"This flick reminded me of those lame ""erotic thrillers"" I used to stay up late and watch on Cinemax when I was 13."
10486,tt0326820,11144,2,I'd label this flick softer core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder.
10487,tt0326820,11144,3,"There is, however, a ton of nudity the opening scene is in a strip club, we see Kane Hodder's keester or at least a stunt butt and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the Munster's for a costume. 13 year old boys rejoice."
10488,tt0326820,11144,4,Other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I've seen in years.
10489,tt0326820,11144,5,The shots look like FMV's from the video game Resident Evil in terms of quality.
10490,tt0326820,11144,6,"The wolf is too bad to be explained and, despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way, way too many times."
10491,tt0326820,11144,7,The plot and acting make no sense.
10492,tt0326820,11144,8,"There is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves the Darkwolf is the latter but from what I can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do look human, change to a wolf an kill people."
10493,tt0326820,11144,9,The Darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly can't find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches.
10494,tt0326820,11144,10,"Once more, this skills proves less than useful since the Darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched, met or even saw as best I can tell."
10495,tt0326820,11144,11,The mate doesn't know she's a werewolf and she's fighting the transformation or something.
10496,tt0326820,11144,12,"You'd think it'd be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but, well they did."
10497,tt0326820,11144,13,"Want quality low end werewolf ism, go rent Dog soldiers want a ton of T&A this is your flick."
10498,tt0326820,11145,1,Where to start .! . . .
10499,tt0326820,11145,2,I feel ... violated!
10500,tt0326820,11145,3,"Thats right, violated!"
10501,tt0326820,11145,4,"I just spent 1.5hrs of my life, 1.5hrs that I could have spent doing something more useful, like watching paint dry, on this so called horror flick."
10502,tt0326820,11145,5,"Its not scary, its not funny, its not dramatic, its no action, its nothing..."
10503,tt0326820,11145,6,"Its predictable, its boring, its tragic..."
10504,tt0326820,11145,7,"I might come of a bit harsh here, but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no, don't watch it...unless you want to feel violated also."
10505,tt0326820,11146,1,"Well, no, not really."
10506,tt0326820,11146,2,"Its not really a good movie, but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be."
10507,tt0326820,11146,3,"I really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money, and sometimes thats all you can ask for."
10508,tt0326820,11146,4,"The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty."
10509,tt0326820,11146,5,"The directing is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big problem."
10510,tt0326820,11146,6,"There was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, but it wasn't all that hot."
10511,tt0326820,11146,7,"All in all, its a fairly average direct to video movie, not the worst film I've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan, check it out sometime."
10512,tt0326820,11146,8,I'd even watch it again.
10513,tt0326820,11146,9,"Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder Jason Vorhees in a few of them plays the werewolf."
10514,tt0326820,11147,1,"I have nothing to comment on this movie It is so bad that I had to put my first comment on IMDb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting, instead of watching this ""movie"" ... anything will do, even stare at the walls is better."
10515,tt0326820,11147,2,"And because I have to write minimum 10 lines of text, i tell you also is a low budget movie, bad acting, no name actors, a stupid mutt as the wolf, and so on..."
10516,tt0326820,11147,3,"Also the story brings nothing new, the special effects are made in the 80's style."
10517,tt0326820,11147,4,"The movie is almost as bad as the movie ""Megalodon""."
10518,tt0326820,11147,5,So have fun!
10519,tt0326820,11147,6,; not watching this movie
10520,tt0326820,11148,1,"This is the prime example of low budget, winning over what would be a good story line."
10521,tt0326820,11148,2,Let's bring back Samaire Armstrong having seen her work on the O.C.
10522,tt0326820,11148,3,"I know she can do better, then find a better script and budget."
10523,tt0326820,11148,4,"The special effects were so bad, and mostly badly computer generated, that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on screen."
10524,tt0326820,11148,5,And Samaire Armstrong's alert!
10525,tt0326820,11148,6,"changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad GCIF figure before she even begins to changeFinal Fantasy's humans, as well as Pixar's made these laughable, think of the figure as a nude Barbie Doll."
10526,tt0326820,11148,7,"The story of was interesting, though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new."
10527,tt0326820,11148,8,"As it also got into the balance between evil, maybe not so evil, and the possible end of human kind should the two lines mate."
10528,tt0326820,11148,9,"The subplot of a ""book of werewolf linage"" which effected some of the other characters in a spell like manner for a while was effective, but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past."
10529,tt0326820,11148,10,"Bring in a better script and direction, and I'd come back again."
10530,tt0326820,11149,1,Recap: Full moon.
10531,tt0326820,11149,2,"A creature, a huge werewolf, is on the hunt."
10532,tt0326820,11149,3,"Not for flesh, not for blood not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though, but for a mate."
10533,tt0326820,11149,4,He is on the hunt for a girl.
10534,tt0326820,11149,5,Not any girl though.
10535,tt0326820,11149,6,The Girl.
10536,tt0326820,11149,7,"The girl that is pure and also a werewolf, although she doesn't know it yet."
10537,tt0326820,11149,8,"Three, well check that, two cops after the first scene and an old bag lady is all that can stop it, or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf."
10538,tt0326820,11149,9,"This particular powerful werewolf, Darkwolf, is closing in on the girl."
10539,tt0326820,11149,10,"If he gets her, mankind is doomed."
10540,tt0326820,11149,11,"Now the cops has to find the girl, convince her not only that there is someone, a werewolf nonetheless, that wants to rape her, and perhaps kill her, but that she is a werewolf herself."
10541,tt0326820,11149,12,And then they got to stop him...
10542,tt0326820,11149,13,"Comments: This is one for the boys, the teenage boys."
10543,tt0326820,11149,14,A lot of scenes with semi nude girls more or less important for the plot.
10544,tt0326820,11149,15,Mostly less.
10545,tt0326820,11149,16,Well I guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is expectedly thin.
10546,tt0326820,11149,17,And unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking.
10547,tt0326820,11149,18,One usually turns to two main themes.
10548,tt0326820,11149,19,Nudity.
10549,tt0326820,11149,20,Check.
10550,tt0326820,11149,21,And then special effects.
10551,tt0326820,11149,22,Hmm...
10552,tt0326820,11149,23,Well there are some things that you might call effects.
10553,tt0326820,11149,24,They're not very special though.
10554,tt0326820,11149,25,"In fact, to be blunt, they are very bad."
10555,tt0326820,11149,26,The movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds.
10556,tt0326820,11149,27,"They couldn't afford clothes for some of the girls ;, and the effects are cheap."
10557,tt0326820,11149,28,"Some of the transformations between werewolf and human form, obviously done by computer, are really bad."
10558,tt0326820,11149,29,You might overlook such things.
10559,tt0326820,11149,30,"But the Darkwolf in itself is very crude too, and you never get to see any killings."
10560,tt0326820,11149,31,Just some mutilated corpses afterwards.
10561,tt0326820,11149,32,"And there is surprisingly little blood about, in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood."
10562,tt0326820,11149,33,I'm not sure what to say about actors and characters.
10563,tt0326820,11149,34,"Most of the times they do well, but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters or actors just looses it."
10564,tt0326820,11149,35,A few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above.
10565,tt0326820,11149,36,"Like the poor effects, or the poor budget.."
10566,tt0326820,11149,37,"That could explain why there is precious little shooting, even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight and not moving."
10567,tt0326820,11149,38,"But hey, when you're in real danger, there nothing that will save your life like a good one liner..."
10568,tt0326820,11149,39,"Unfortunately that can't explain moments when the Cop, Steve, the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem, the werewolf that is, runs away, when the only things he can be sure of, is that the werewolf is coming for the girl, who is just beside him now, and that he cannot let it have her."
10569,tt0326820,11149,40,"But sure, it let the makers stretch the ending a little more..."
10570,tt0326820,11149,41,But I wouldn't mind seeing none of the lead actors/actresses get another try in another movie.
10571,tt0326820,11149,42,Well.
10572,tt0326820,11149,43,To give a small conclusion: Not a movie that I recommend.3/10
10573,tt0326820,11150,1,"I watched this film alone, in the dark, and it was full moon outside!"
10574,tt0326820,11150,2,"I didn't do it in purpose, it just happened in this way."
10575,tt0326820,11150,3,So all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me!!
10576,tt0326820,11150,4,"Well, it didn't, in fact i wanted to shut off the DVD player after only 8 minutes, but i thought come on give it a chance, unfortunately i did."
10577,tt0326820,11150,5,"The acting was awful, the only one with some decent acting was Samaire Armstrong."
10578,tt0326820,11150,6,"The plot is not original, if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before."
10579,tt0326820,11150,7,"Some scenes didn't make sense at all, and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer!"
10580,tt0326820,11150,8,The monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie.
10581,tt0326820,11150,9,"The scary scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology, yet some good movies were made back then!"
10582,tt0326820,11150,10,"I was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie, i thought couldn't they put some money in this and make it decent.!!"
10583,tt0326820,11150,11,"I couldn't agree more with the ratings that the movie got, it is also my rating for it, 3 out of 10."
10584,tt0326820,11151,1,"DarkWolf tells the tale of a young waitress named Josie Samaire Armstrong who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend Mary Tippi Hedren is killed by a Werewolf, you see Werewolves actually exist in modern day America & there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the Werewolf threat headed up by Detective Steve Turley Ryan Olosio who has the difficult task of telling Josie that she is in fact a pure blooded Werewolf herself & that a so called 'dark prince' Werewolf Kane Hodder wants to mate with her & create a new breed of pure blood Werewolves that will take over the entire world, or something like that."
10585,tt0326820,11151,2,"Understandably Josie has a hard time believing it, that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes."
10586,tt0326820,11151,3,"It's up to Werewolf cop Steve to save Josie, the day & the world..."
10587,tt0326820,11151,4,Co executive produced & directed Richard Friedman I thought DarkWolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn't really do anything for me.
10588,tt0326820,11151,5,The script by Geoffrey Alan Holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show & then there's a Werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it's pretty much down hill all the way I'm afraid.
10589,tt0326820,11151,6,"For a start it's slow going, it's dull, it's predictable & it's populated with highly annoying character's who come out with lots of bad dialogue & do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the Werewolf they don't, I have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead."
10590,tt0326820,11151,7,"The script is dumb & doesn't explain itself, why has Josie never turned into a Werewolf before."
10591,tt0326820,11151,8,Is she really the only one.
10592,tt0326820,11151,9,Why can't this 'dark prince' find another female Werewolf.
10593,tt0326820,11151,10,"There are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half way through but you get the idea anyway, as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least."
10594,tt0326820,11151,11,Director Friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original & doesn't really improve the film as a spectacle.
10595,tt0326820,11151,12,"Now let's talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in DarkWolf are far from special, the Werewolf transformation is achieved using CGI & it's among the worst looking CGI I've ever seen, seriously a Playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics."
10596,tt0326820,11151,13,"It's easily the worst Werewolf transformation I've ever seen, An American Werewolf in London 1981 was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light years ahead of the ones seen in DarkWolf, who says special effects have improved over the years."
10597,tt0326820,11151,14,The animatronic puppet effects aren't much better either although at least there's something psychical on screen.
10598,tt0326820,11151,15,The gore isn't up to much after a gory opening kill there's some blood splatter & plenty of dead bodies but not much else.
10599,tt0326820,11151,16,"Thre's a fair amount of female nudity if that's your thing but don't get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it, is it really worth it."
10600,tt0326820,11151,17,"Technically DarkWolf is alright apart from possibly the worst CGI effect ever, it's reasonably well made & it at least seems to have production values."
10601,tt0326820,11151,18,The acting is what you'd expect really.
10602,tt0326820,11151,19,"DarkWolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves & clutter the schedules of obscure cable TV stations, I didn't think it was as bad as some but it's like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said & done they're both horrible still..."
10603,tt0326820,11152,1,"Why bother seeing this movie, if you have great movies to see."
10604,tt0326820,11152,2,It is a total waste of time and money.
10605,tt0326820,11152,3,The movie is so bad that I felt bad for wanting to watching it.
10606,tt0326820,11152,4,Everything in it is BAD.
10607,tt0326820,11152,5,Actors were bad.
10608,tt0326820,11152,6,Script was REALLY bad.
10609,tt0326820,11152,7,The story is stupid.
10610,tt0326820,11152,8,And the worst CGI EVER.
10611,tt0326820,11152,9,The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club.
10612,tt0326820,11152,10,"One interesting thing that, there is a characther that we wish that he dies because, he is so stupid that we get enough of him."
10613,tt0326820,11152,11,"I don't remember the name but was the BOYFRIEND of the ""Chosen One""."
10614,tt0326820,11152,12,"NOTE:If you want to see a good movie, this movie isn't the right choice."
10615,tt0326820,11152,13,0 Stars out of 10
10616,tt0326820,11153,1,Another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story.
10617,tt0326820,11153,2,"Within 15 minutes, the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery, which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense."
10618,tt0326820,11153,3,"The only half way competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film, so we're left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things."
10619,tt0326820,11153,4,"Low budget films can't afford expensive special effects, so the CGI portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive, but were at least a valid attempt."
10620,tt0326820,11153,5,"The creature suit is terrible, as seen when it falls to the sidewalk, and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes, which aren't even the red color shown in mirror shots."
10621,tt0326820,11153,6,"The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired, with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator."
10622,tt0326820,11153,7,"The last action sequence takes place in a police station, also a rip off from Terminator, with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the Darkwolf doesn't smash into."
10623,tt0326820,11153,8,"In the end, the girl calls the hero ""a good Protector"", but he gets both his partners, the original Protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen cops, all killed without getting a decent shot off, in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun."
10624,tt0326820,11153,9,But here's the real clincher for bad writing: They could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes.
10625,tt0326820,11153,10,"Instead, they took it into custody.!."
10626,tt0326820,11154,1,This move was on TV last night.
10627,tt0326820,11154,2,"I guess as a time filler, because it sucked bad!"
10628,tt0326820,11154,3,The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way.
10629,tt0326820,11154,4,Not bad tits and ass though.
10630,tt0326820,11154,5,But the story is too ridiculous for words.
10631,tt0326820,11154,6,"The ""wolf"", if that is what you can call it, is hardly shown fully save his teeth."
10632,tt0326820,11154,7,"When it is fully in view, you can clearly see they had some interns working on the CGI, because the wolf runs like he's running in a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like it's been waxed, all shiny :The movie is full of gore and blood, and you can easily spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next."
10633,tt0326820,11154,8,"Even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed, they didn't do a good job at it."
10634,tt0326820,11154,9,Don't even get me started on the actors...
10635,tt0326820,11154,10,Very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds.
10636,tt0326820,11154,11,"But then again, if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do I sign up."
10637,tt0326820,11154,12,Overall boring and laughable horror.
10638,tt0326820,11155,1,"The only reason I even watched this was because I found it at my local library and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it, and despite the plethora of tits and ass, it didn't take long to realize that the fast forward button was my friend."
10639,tt0326820,11155,2,"Terrible direction, pedestrian camera work, sporadically bad to nearly passable acting, chintzy effects, and one of the worst screenplays I've had the displeasure of seeing brought to life such as it was, horribly crippled and mutilated in a long, long time."
10640,tt0326820,11155,3,"Best laughs actually come from the ""Making of..."" featurette, in which the poor saps involved with this HDV mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special, instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week."
10641,tt0326820,11155,4,Wait!
10642,tt0326820,11155,5,"Except for the fact that somehow someone lured Tippi ""The Birds"" Hedren, of all people, into doing a bit part, along with Kane ""Friday the 13th"" Hodder!"
10643,tt0326820,11155,6,"How this came to pass, I'll never know, and to be honest, I don't really care."
10644,tt0326820,11155,7,"Watch at your own risk, and don't say you haven't been warned."
10645,tt0326820,11155,8,"This is film making at its pretentious, craven worst."
10646,tt0326820,11155,9,"It only gets a 2 from me for having some good looking naked women, and even then, just barely."
10647,tt0326820,11156,1,Dark Wolf Quick Review Let's get right to it: This is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sht on it.
10648,tt0326820,11156,2,It's just an awful movie.
10649,tt0326820,11156,3,It's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80's high school drama film.
10650,tt0326820,11156,4,What's worse is that poor Kane Hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf.
10651,tt0326820,11156,5,Kane fcking Hodder.

10654,tt0326820,11156,8,It's kind of a crappy cop drama with the world's worst looking werewolf in it.
10655,tt0326820,11156,9,But it does have moments of near rampant nudity.

10676,tt0326820,11157,13,he's the one who gets killed in the first five minutes.
10677,tt0326820,11157,14,"The film goes downhill for the next hour or so, then picks up a little with some decent action sequences, before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending."
10678,tt0326820,11157,15,"For the most part, the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who's willing to settle for less."

10680,tt0326820,11157,17,DarkWolf in his human form is played by gargantuan Kane Hodder famous for his numerous portrayals of Jason Vorhees in the 'Friday the 13th' movies.

10719,tt0389957,1006,9,The characters were so one dimensional that it makes some Bible characters look like the Don Corleone.
10720,tt0389957,1006,10,They got the one liners and sound bite worthy stuff.
10721,tt0389957,1006,11,The token troubled black guy LL COOL J who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life.
10722,tt0389957,1006,12,The captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone.
10723,tt0389957,1006,13,And what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience.
10724,tt0389957,1006,14,"Oh and lots of gun fire, i mean a whole lot."
10725,tt0389957,1006,15,SPOILERNOT!!!
10726,tt0389957,1006,16,THe kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who's crooked dead and the hero prevails.
10727,tt0389957,1006,17,"They got flame throwers and rocket launchers, REally no kidding."
10728,tt0389957,1006,18,"Bottom line if you want to see Edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors, or a great fan of Justin Timberlake, to all the 13 year old girls out there, enjoy!!"
10729,tt0389957,1006,19,"I wish i had more hands, because then I would have more thumbs, because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening."
10730,tt0389957,1006,20,MAY GD HAVE MERCY ON US ALL and save us from these terrible movies.
10731,tt0389957,1006,21,"Well it could be worst, another RNB terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher, hehe check out IN THE MIX lol, or even Get rich or die trying'."
10732,tt0389957,1006,22,"Now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30+ year old men, playing 16 or even younger teens."
10733,tt0389957,1006,23,I could go on with these.
10734,tt0389957,1007,1,I found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film.
10735,tt0389957,1007,2,"I managed to stomach 45 50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching Monster House instead which, by the way, is great fun."
10736,tt0389957,1007,3,The story has massive holes in it.
10737,tt0389957,1007,4,"The plot line is hugely over stated and dull, the acting is awful, especially from Justin TImberlake who should really stick to what he is good at looking daft and singing like a castrato."
10738,tt0389957,1007,5,"Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and Timberlake meet."
10739,tt0389957,1007,6,"Freeman and Timberlake's characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father/son relationship of sorts or something, which simply isn't evident at all apart from the fact that; though Freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of Timberlake, he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up."
10740,tt0389957,1007,7,"It would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line, which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion."
10741,tt0389957,1007,8,"Don't watch this film, it is a pure waste of time."
10742,tt0389957,1008,1,"The plot of 'Edison' was decent, but one actor in particular ruined the entire film."
10743,tt0389957,1008,2,Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie.
10744,tt0389957,1008,3,"He is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. squad."
10745,tt0389957,1008,4,"Whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene, or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it."
10746,tt0389957,1008,5,Do not waste your time watching this film.
10747,tt0389957,1008,6,"Don't even bother downloading it, midget porn would be a much better choice."
10748,tt0389957,1008,7,"And Justin, if you're reading this, stick to music."
10749,tt0389957,1008,8,"Even though you're no good at that, you've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing."
10750,tt0389957,1009,1,REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS  I'll make this review short and sweet.
10751,tt0389957,1009,2,I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman.
10752,tt0389957,1009,3,"How bad could it be, right."
10753,tt0389957,1009,4,"Well, it's pretty bad."
10754,tt0389957,1009,5,"Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edison's Police Force."
10755,tt0389957,1009,6,"LL Cool J is Deed, a cop within the force on a special force team called F.R.A.T."
10756,tt0389957,1009,7,First Response Assault Tactics.
10757,tt0389957,1009,8,"He's teamed with an ""on the edge"" bad cop named Lazerov Dylan McDermott."
10758,tt0389957,1009,9,"In the opening scene we see Lazerov & Deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs."
10759,tt0389957,1009,10,"I don't want to give to much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs."
10760,tt0389957,1009,11,"Pollack, who works for Ashford Morgan Freeman goes to a trial involving Deeds & Lazerov."
10761,tt0389957,1009,12,"He suspect foul play and with the help of Ashford, does some investigate that turns ugly."
10762,tt0389957,1009,13,Wallace Kevin Spacey who is all within the F.R.A.T. team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.
10763,tt0389957,1009,14,You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey's performance are pretty lackluster.
10764,tt0389957,1009,15,The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott.
10765,tt0389957,1009,16,He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me.
10766,tt0389957,1009,17,LL Cool J is terrible in this film.
10767,tt0389957,1009,18,He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion.
10768,tt0389957,1009,19,He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday.
10769,tt0389957,1009,20,The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film.
10770,tt0389957,1009,21,The ending is far from satisfying.
10771,tt0389957,1009,22,Don't waste your time with this film.
10772,tt0389957,1009,23,I'm putting it on Ebay this weekend.
10773,tt0389957,1010,1,I rented this movie last week.
10774,tt0389957,1010,2,"I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it seemed promising."
10775,tt0389957,1010,3,"And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on scene."
10776,tt0389957,1010,4,He is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again.
10777,tt0389957,1010,5,"I mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen."
10778,tt0389957,1010,6,He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever.
10779,tt0389957,1010,7,Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack.
10780,tt0389957,1010,8,I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice.
10781,tt0389957,1010,9,Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment.
10782,tt0389957,1010,10,"His character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en."
10783,tt0389957,1010,11,"It might sound cool, but believe me, it's not."
10784,tt0389957,1010,12,"Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good."
10785,tt0389957,1010,13,It's about one of the very few good things about this movie.
10786,tt0389957,1010,14,He is just inspired.
10787,tt0389957,1010,15,Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special.
10788,tt0389957,1010,16,He has some really cool lines though.
10789,tt0389957,1010,17,"About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good."
10790,tt0389957,1010,18,"I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov Dylan McDermott was killed, but nothing really happened."
10791,tt0389957,1011,1,LL Cool J.
10792,tt0389957,1011,2,Morgan Freeman.
10793,tt0389957,1011,3,Dylan McDermott.
10794,tt0389957,1011,4,Kevin Spacey.
10795,tt0389957,1011,5,John Heard.
10796,tt0389957,1011,6,Cary Elwes.
10797,tt0389957,1011,7,Roslyn Sanchez.
10798,tt0389957,1011,8,Justin Timberlake wait a minute.
10799,tt0389957,1011,9,Justin Timberlake.
10800,tt0389957,1011,10,And he's the star.
10801,tt0389957,1011,11,I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE.
10802,tt0389957,1011,12,"In fact, I did know better."
10803,tt0389957,1011,13,"But in a moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV."
10804,tt0389957,1011,14,"When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog."
10805,tt0389957,1011,15,As in sat on a shelf.
10806,tt0389957,1011,16,Which this did.
10807,tt0389957,1011,17,And with good reason.
10808,tt0389957,1011,18,"The plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la MAGNUM FORCE, and ""journalist"" Timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them."
10809,tt0389957,1011,19,He is targeted for his efforts or maybe I should say for his horrible acting.
10810,tt0389957,1011,20,I turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing.
10811,tt0389957,1011,21,Just awful.
10812,tt0389957,1011,22,"The real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard, looking like nothing so much as a hobo."
10813,tt0389957,1011,23,You just know the director was not in control.
10814,tt0389957,1011,24,Freeman is clearly slumming.
10815,tt0389957,1012,1,How can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up.
10816,tt0389957,1012,2,"With enough cops to run a mini war that include such weapons as flamethrowers, you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying 'thanks' to a corrupt cop."
10817,tt0389957,1012,3,You will never get your 90ish minutes back.
10818,tt0389957,1012,4,Life is too precious to rent this movie.
10819,tt0389957,1012,5,I feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie.
10820,tt0389957,1012,6,"If you like Justin Timberlake, feel free to rent this movie."
10821,tt0389957,1012,7,"He does have a very major part in it, so fans might enjoy seeing him."
10822,tt0389957,1012,8,"However, I believe most of his fans are young girls, who may be turned off by the violence in this movie."
10823,tt0389957,1013,1,"If you watched this movie you know why I said ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus""."
10824,tt0389957,1013,2,Hehehe!!!
10825,tt0389957,1013,3,"Every time they said ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus""..."
10826,tt0389957,1013,4,"I laughed thinking ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie""."
10827,tt0389957,1013,5,I cannot believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen.
10828,tt0389957,1013,6,WTF is Timberlake.
10829,tt0389957,1013,7,Dreaful acting!
10830,tt0389957,1013,8,I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job!
10831,tt0389957,1013,9,"This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I am not a big fun of him... but I really prefer an actor, not this android called Timberlake."
10832,tt0389957,1013,10,"And his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell."
10833,tt0389957,1013,11,I was happy when they both were popped in the street.
10834,tt0389957,1013,12,The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role very well.
10835,tt0389957,1013,13,The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake ruined it all.
10836,tt0389957,1013,14,It would have been much enjoyable without him.
10837,tt0389957,1013,15,"By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes, low motion and things like that."
10838,tt0389957,1013,16,Something misplaced for this cops movie I thought.
10839,tt0389957,1013,17,Maybe they wanted to make a MTV video clip for Timberlake.
10840,tt0389957,1014,1,Timberlake's performance almost made attack the screen.
10841,tt0389957,1014,2,"It wasn't all bad, I just think the reporters role was wrong for him."
10842,tt0389957,1014,3,"LL Cool J played the typical rapper role, toughest,baddest guy around."
10843,tt0389957,1014,4,"I don't think the cracked a smile in the whole movie, not even when proposed to his girlfriend."
10844,tt0389957,1014,5,Morgan Freeman pretty much carried the whole movie.
10845,tt0389957,1014,6,He was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie.
10846,tt0389957,1014,7,"Kevin Spacey wasn't good or bad he was just ""there""."
10847,tt0389957,1014,8,Overall it's a Dull movie. bad plot. a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors.
10848,tt0389957,1015,1,Pathetic... worse than a bad made for TV movie.
10849,tt0389957,1015,2,I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick.
10850,tt0389957,1015,3,"For some reason Morgan Freeman's character is constantly talking about and saying ""pussy"" when referring to NSync boy's girlfriend."
10851,tt0389957,1015,4,"Morgan Freeman calling women ""pussy"" is just awkward..."
10852,tt0389957,1015,5,What the hell were the people behind this film thinking.
10853,tt0389957,1015,6,"Too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting, confusing camera angles, a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable."
10854,tt0389957,1015,7,I rented this flop with low expectations.... but... well... it really sucked.
10855,tt0389957,1016,1,"The movie itself is not too bad; many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script, but it is watchable."
10856,tt0389957,1016,2,"What really gives me the creeps though is that people like Justin Timberlake even get cast for movies, and on top of that for movies like this one."
10857,tt0389957,1016,3,"I have to admit I had never heard the man's name before watching this, but the very instant he appeared I was just plain annoyed."
10858,tt0389957,1016,4,"The voice is crap, the face is a bad rip off of Legolas, the posture is horrible, and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them."
10859,tt0389957,1016,5,"Said to say, I was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco, because I was hoping from then on it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only."
10860,tt0389957,1016,6,Too bad I was wrong.
10861,tt0389957,1016,7,"These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance, and they are the main reason I give this a 4."
10862,tt0389957,1016,8,I see many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake cast... and cannot believe it.
10863,tt0389957,1017,1,Oh dear god.
10864,tt0389957,1017,2,This was horrible.
10865,tt0389957,1017,3,"There is bad, then there was this."
10866,tt0389957,1017,4,This movie makes no sense at all.
10867,tt0389957,1017,5,It runs all over the map and isn't clear about what its saying at all.
10868,tt0389957,1017,6,The music seemed like it was trying to be like Batman.
10869,tt0389957,1017,7,"The fact that 'Edison' isn't a real city, takes away."
10870,tt0389957,1017,8,"Since I live in Vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable."
10871,tt0389957,1017,9,Why didn't they make it a real city.
10872,tt0389957,1017,10,The only writing that was decent was'Tilman' in which John Heard did a fantastic job.
10873,tt0389957,1017,11,He was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy.
10874,tt0389957,1017,12,"It was actually a shame to see John Heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie be a washout."
10875,tt0389957,1017,13,Too bad.
10876,tt0389957,1017,14,"Hopefully someone important will see it, and at least give John Heard credit where credit is due, and hire him as lead bad guy again, which is where he should be. on the A List."
10877,tt0389957,1018,1,There is an excellent reason Edison went straight to video: it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud.
10878,tt0389957,1018,2,The movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring.
10879,tt0389957,1018,3,"Just a notch above lowbrow thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films, the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non existent as Justin Timberlake's acting."
10880,tt0389957,1018,4,"I hate to knock the guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better."
10881,tt0389957,1018,5,The movie isn't all bad...just mostly.
10882,tt0389957,1018,6,I like the fact that LL Cool J was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man.
10883,tt0389957,1018,7,He deserves it.
10884,tt0389957,1018,8,"And, unlike his fellow musician and co star, he can act."
10885,tt0389957,1018,9,"Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable as well you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery, and Freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars out of ten...he's not THAT good."
10886,tt0389957,1018,10,"When all is said and done, the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake."
10887,tt0389957,1018,11,It also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters.
10888,tt0389957,1018,12,"All in all, t's just plain boring."
10889,tt0389957,1018,13,"That being said, rent this when you are suffering from insomnia."
10890,tt0389957,1019,1,"Honestly before I watched this movie, I had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace."
10891,tt0389957,1019,2,"I did not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey have taken roles in this movie, and watched it by my own."
10892,tt0389957,1019,3,Apparently they were right.
10893,tt0389957,1019,4,I was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie why the hell did I watch this movie.
10894,tt0389957,1019,5,Of course I was not expecting much from Justin as he really does not belong in the movie/theater business.
10895,tt0389957,1019,6,But Morgan and Kevin.
10896,tt0389957,1019,7,I could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in Edison.
10897,tt0389957,1019,8,"To be honest, their roles are rather stupid."
10898,tt0389957,1019,9,"Well you might think if the players suck, then I should pay more attention to the story."
10899,tt0389957,1019,10,"It is indeed story is the core of a movie, but guys... trust me... this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story."
10900,tt0389957,1019,11,"Imagine this, a smart ass journalist Justin Timberlake wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a 'real' journalist from his boss Morgan Freeman."
10901,tt0389957,1019,12,This all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice LL Cool J and an brilliant investigator Kevin Spacey.
10902,tt0389957,1019,13,"At the end, they beat the system with a happy ending story."
10903,tt0389957,1019,14,"Jeez, I could not even carry on with this."
10904,tt0389957,1019,15,Just recalling the movie is making me sick already.
10905,tt0389957,1019,16,"My advise guys, don't watch this!"
10906,tt0389957,1019,17,Please save your money and time for another movie.
10907,tt0389957,1020,1,"Lets enter the world of this movie for a second, so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here."
10908,tt0389957,1020,2,"Edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose 50,000 bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars, shouting at them, and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him......instead of wasting this guy that has caused you SO MUCH grief....instead of just walking up and POP!....."
10909,tt0389957,1020,3,What do you do.
10910,tt0389957,1020,4,The bad guy.....he talks to him.
10911,tt0389957,1020,5,He grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun.
10912,tt0389957,1020,6,THEY HAVE NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT!
10913,tt0389957,1020,7,SHOOT HIM!
10914,tt0389957,1020,8,SHOOT HIM NOW!
10915,tt0389957,1020,9,But he talks to him anyway.
10916,tt0389957,1020,10,Oh another thing.
10917,tt0389957,1020,11,"At the end, a newspaper says ""PULITZER PRIZE WINNER STORY RIGHT HERE"" or something right above on a front page of a paper, when its like the first time the story is printed."
10918,tt0389957,1020,12,So how in the heezy did someone win a Pulitzer for it that fast.
10919,tt0389957,1020,13,"Yea, you know those types of stupid movies."
10920,tt0389957,1020,14,Yea well that's Edison in a nutshell.
10921,tt0389957,1020,15,"You get Mr cool Morgan Freeman and shifty eyed tough Kevin Spacey who both phone in their roles completely, LL Cool J who scowls literally every single moment of the movie,while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places,and who's last line ""Duck"" was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made... and Justin Timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks, little cocky bastard."
10922,tt0389957,1020,16,"The only bright spot was a crazy Dylan McDermott doing his best ""Denzel from Training Day"" impression, which was pretty entertaining."
10923,tt0389957,1020,17,Oh yea so whats the movie about.
10924,tt0389957,1020,18,"Eh, something about scandals involving the city Edison's fictional special unit police force called ""F.R.A.T."
10925,tt0389957,1020,19,I swear I'm not making this stuff up which was supposed to be a obvious play off of S.W.A.T.
10926,tt0389957,1020,20,"Anyway little journalistic super singer boy Justin Timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving 2 undercover cops from FRAT, and he goes scurrying off looking for a story, gaining his boss' Freeman trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought. blah blah blah."
10927,tt0389957,1020,21,Its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day.
10928,tt0389957,1020,22,"The pacing was slow and off, the script was horrible, and the acting was extremely uninspired."
10929,tt0389957,1020,23,It jumped everywhere without going anywhere.
10930,tt0389957,1020,24,People get put in comas and you forget about them.
10931,tt0389957,1020,25,Everyone in this movie just didn't THINK.
10932,tt0389957,1020,26,Damn what a stupid movie.
10933,tt0389957,1020,27,Its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended...
10934,tt0389957,1020,28,"No lie Basically, do NOT waste your time!"
10935,tt0389957,1021,1,"The movie started off strong, LL Cool J Deed as an undercover police officer, with partner Sgt."
10936,tt0389957,1021,2,"Lazerov Dylan McDermott from the Practice, possibly miscast as a bad guy. committing robbery and murder."
10937,tt0389957,1021,3,"Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience."
10938,tt0389957,1021,4,"The other big names Freeman, Spacey et al are well cast and the movie shows promise."
10939,tt0389957,1021,5,The movie begins to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake Pollack is introduced.
10940,tt0389957,1021,6,"Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of Timberlake, I would choose the former."
10941,tt0389957,1021,7,Even talented actors have to work hard at their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of hard work can save him.
10942,tt0389957,1021,8,"I would have thought he would put on a better show, given the fact that he has been acting talented for years."
10943,tt0389957,1021,9,Everything he did in this film was unconvincing.
10944,tt0389957,1021,10,"Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums, it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films."
10945,tt0389957,1021,11,Even hardcore N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent.
10946,tt0389957,1021,12,"That aside there are a few plot holes, such as Pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery."
10947,tt0389957,1021,13,This movie had so much promise.
10948,tt0389957,1021,14,Thoroughly disappointing.
10949,tt0389957,1022,1,"Beginning with the poster featuring only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, the entire movie was a fraud."
10950,tt0389957,1022,2,"One stereotype after another, this movie was about nothing or nothing new, at least."
10951,tt0389957,1022,3,"After 10 15 minutes, you realize that you've just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite their way through another cop flick."
10952,tt0389957,1022,4,"Basically, the story is about the corrupt system in some city, all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town, under the watchful eye of some hot shot politician."
10953,tt0389957,1022,5,"The almighty and above the law organization is called FRAT and guess what. they've got a kick ass loony cop shooting and beating at will suspects, girlfriends, you name it."
10954,tt0389957,1022,6,"FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented !!!"
10955,tt0389957,1022,7,journalist.
10956,tt0389957,1022,8,"One hour later, after a series of unbelievably bad made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines, everything ends happily and we get served the final line : you can't beat the system."
10957,tt0389957,1022,9,Bah!
10958,tt0389957,1022,10,Don't see this waste of film roll.
10959,tt0389957,1022,11,Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 min altogether!
10960,tt0389957,1023,1,LL Cool J performed much better in this movie that I expected!
10961,tt0389957,1023,2,"He did a fabulous job acting as a ""renegade"" cop within a ""renegade"" department."
10962,tt0389957,1023,3,"From the very beginning, he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he's in."
10963,tt0389957,1023,4,"He acts as a sort of ""gentle giant"" a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody, yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start and he does an amazing job."
10964,tt0389957,1023,5,He was quite clearly the best character in the movie.
10965,tt0389957,1023,6,This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards.
10966,tt0389957,1023,7,After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down.
10967,tt0389957,1023,8,His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner.
10968,tt0389957,1023,9,There are so many ways his character Moses Ashford could have taken a more pivotal role.
10969,tt0389957,1023,10,That he didn't was disappointing and a true let down.
10970,tt0389957,1023,11,I was hoping to see more from him in this film.
10971,tt0389957,1023,12,Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry.
10972,tt0389957,1023,13,His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive.
10973,tt0389957,1023,14,This movie is a typical action movie that at least initially bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past.
10974,tt0389957,1023,15,"Being an action movie, it has its share of shoot em up scenes, blood, and guts."
10975,tt0389957,1023,16,These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable.
10976,tt0389957,1023,17,Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end think of what you would typically expect in a good cops/bad cops conflict and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shoot out.
10977,tt0389957,1023,18,What irked me most was the way Timberlake's character behaved during shoot out scenes.
10978,tt0389957,1023,19,He starts out having guns and not using them.
10979,tt0389957,1023,20,Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life.
10980,tt0389957,1023,21,"Then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo.!"
10981,tt0389957,1023,22,Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.
10982,tt0389957,1023,23,"If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay, then you'll probably love this movie."
10983,tt0389957,1023,24,"Personally, it doesn't matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic."
10984,tt0389957,1023,25,Make me believe that the story is true.
10985,tt0389957,1023,26,This story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that I came away feeling unsatisfied.
10986,tt0389957,1024,1,"i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations. the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good, right. how wrong i was. i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey a director/writer of wiseguy making his feature debut = blah... well the director/writer of Edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man, because i cannot see how he along with the other actors in the film would ever agree to be in this disaster. this movie is absolutely appalling!"
10987,tt0389957,1024,2,it's a mixture of every cop hard boiled clich√© ever. there is nothing new with Edison. the acting was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy. this was the best casted direct to video movie i've ever seen. some examples of just bad silly moments in Edison... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music... justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles... llcoolj driving a vintage firebird... 3 guys being shot in the head...this movie is the opposite of good.
10988,tt0389957,1024,3,STAY AWAY FROM EDISON!
10989,tt0389957,1025,1,That is the only question I am left with.
10990,tt0389957,1025,2,Why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast.
10991,tt0389957,1025,3,"Why was the writing so bad, it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters."
10992,tt0389957,1025,4,Why did it not make any sense at all.
10993,tt0389957,1025,5,"Why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and ""Hollywood"" the hell out of it when all it needed was good, smart story telling."
10994,tt0389957,1025,6,Why.
10995,tt0389957,1025,7,I never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they're released.
10996,tt0389957,1025,8,"I hope for the sake of Freeman an Spacey, who are Oscar WINNERS, that this never is released to the big screens in America."
10997,tt0389957,1025,9,"As someone that holds a Bachelors Degree in Journalism, the whole story is just utterly laughable."
10998,tt0389957,1025,10,"I just...think the script had potential, but the execution turned it into a clich√©, and an awful one at that."
10999,tt0389957,1025,11,Just.
11000,tt0389957,1025,12,No.
11001,tt0389957,1026,1,Wow.
11002,tt0389957,1026,2,I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast.
11003,tt0389957,1026,3,Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.
11004,tt0389957,1026,4,His acting was PAINFUL to observe.
11005,tt0389957,1026,5,"The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on."
11006,tt0389957,1026,6,How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend.
11007,tt0389957,1026,7,"His character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the hero..."
11008,tt0389957,1026,8,I would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video.
11009,tt0389957,1026,9,"MAYBE if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be OK.Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'Kermit the Frog' act in a Hollywood Blockbuster, just didn't work at all."
11010,tt0389957,1027,1,"Normally, I have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent an hour registering with IMDb just to get it off my chest."
11011,tt0389957,1027,2,"You would think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bankable bet... well, this movie was just terrible."
11012,tt0389957,1027,3,"It is nigh on impossible to ""suspend disbelief""; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy it but Justin Timberlake just wouldn't let me."
11013,tt0389957,1027,4,"Timberlake should stick to music, what a dreadful performance NO presence as an actor,NO character."
11014,tt0389957,1027,5,"Can't blame everything on Justin: The movie also boast a dreadful plot & badly timed editing; its definitely an ""F""."
11015,tt0389957,1027,6,"After seeing this, I have to wonder what really motivates actors."
11016,tt0389957,1027,7,"I mean, surely Morgan actually read the script before taking the part."
11017,tt0389957,1027,8,Did he not see how poor it was.
11018,tt0389957,1027,9,What then could motivate him to take the part.
11019,tt0389957,1027,10,Money.
11020,tt0389957,1027,11,"Of course, acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work."
11021,tt0389957,1027,12,LL Cool J is a great actor; he gets a lot more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script.
11022,tt0389957,1027,13,"Meanwhile, the audience goes: ""What the hell is going on here."
11023,tt0389957,1027,14,"You expect me to believe this crap."""
11024,tt0389957,1027,15,"In short, apart from Justin a great lineup badly executed very disappointing."
11025,tt0389957,1028,1,"I don't remember the last time I reacted to a performance as emotionally as I did to Justin Timberlake's in ""Edison."""
11026,tt0389957,1028,2,"I got so emotional I wanted to scream in anguish, destroy the screen, readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism."
11027,tt0389957,1028,3,"Timberlake is horribly miscast; in fact, casting him is like casting Andy Dick to play the lead role in ""Patton,"" or Nathan Lane to play Jesus."
11028,tt0389957,1028,4,But that is almost beside the point.
11029,tt0389957,1028,5,Timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role.
11030,tt0389957,1028,6,"I used to have problems with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench."
11031,tt0389957,1028,7,"With his metrosexual lisp read lithp, his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like ""The 25 Clich√© Expressions for Actors,"" he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly, and no matter how you slice it, I do not and will not buy his role as an amateur turned crusader for justice journalist."
11032,tt0389957,1028,8,It simply will not fly.
11033,tt0389957,1028,9,"However, Timberlake alone isn't to blame for his failure."
11034,tt0389957,1028,10,Director David J.
11035,tt0389957,1028,11,"Burke puts him not only in the essentially primary role, but also places him aside Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and I'm surprised he was as good LL Cool J."
11036,tt0389957,1028,12,I can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with Timberlake.
11037,tt0389957,1028,13,There is an upside to this of course: the moment any of these actors interact without Justin there it feels like a double relief.
11038,tt0389957,1028,14,"A pleasure, if you will."
11039,tt0389957,1028,15,"Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together, but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so called hero."
11040,tt0389957,1028,16,Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air.
11041,tt0389957,1028,17,But enough of Timberlake bashing words aren't enough in this particular case to do the trick.
11042,tt0389957,1028,18,"""Edison"" is a very, very run of the mill corruption story."
11043,tt0389957,1028,19,It's plot ranges from clich√© to simply preposterous.
11044,tt0389957,1028,20,"I do, however, admire the motivation behind making it, which I interpret as an homage to films like ""Serpico,"" or ""Donnie Brasco,"" or maybe even ""Chinatown."""
11045,tt0389957,1028,21,"Don't get me wrong ""Edison"" is not even in the same ballpark as these films, but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting through it."
11046,tt0389957,1028,22,"The script, in and of itself, features some surprisingly bad writing."
11047,tt0389957,1028,23,"Yes, it has some decent interchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo who is wasted here and Timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a Dawson's Creek episode."
11048,tt0389957,1028,24,"It's your typical far too glib for reality, let's impress the audience with how well we articulate and fail dialogue."
11049,tt0389957,1028,25,"This dialogue, mind you, is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments sometimes it feels like ""Edison"" wants to morph into a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting, but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds read slow motion."
11050,tt0389957,1028,26,"Thinking about it, ""Edison"" is a curiosity."
11051,tt0389957,1028,27,It's sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by Timberlake who simply doesn't work.
11052,tt0389957,1028,28,"In film as in most art, if one thing is off, the whole thing feels off."
11053,tt0389957,1028,29,Directors must make tough choices.
11054,tt0389957,1028,30,David J.
11055,tt0389957,1028,31,Burke missed the mark here.
11056,tt0389957,1028,32,"Some of the scenes play well in and of themselves, but as a whole, they don't seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture."
11057,tt0389957,1028,33,And it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with.
11058,tt0399877,4570,1,Ridiculous.
11059,tt0399877,4570,2,This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment.
11060,tt0399877,4570,3,"If you are wondering who the bleep Ramtha is: ""Ramtha is a 35,000 year old spirit warrior who appeared in J.Z."
11061,tt0399877,4570,4,"Knight's kitchen in Tacoma, Washington in 1977."
11062,tt0399877,4570,5,Knight claims that she is Ramtha's channel.
11063,tt0399877,4570,6,"She also owns the copyright to Ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks Hollywood's version of Elizabethan English in a guttural, husky voice."
11064,tt0399877,4570,7,"She has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha at seminars $1,000 a crack and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment, and from the sales of tapes, books, and accessories Clark and Gallo 1993."
11065,tt0399877,4570,8,She must have hypnotic powers.
11066,tt0399877,4570,9,"Searching for self fulfillment, otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold, muddy, doorless maze."""
11067,tt0399877,4570,10,"John Wheeler, one of America's finest theoretical physicists, would roll his eyes about this movie."
11068,tt0399877,4570,11,He has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory.
11069,tt0399877,4570,12,This movie does the same thing as those fools.
11070,tt0399877,4570,13,There is a great review of this movie at Skeptico.
