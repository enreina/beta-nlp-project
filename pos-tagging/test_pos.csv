"3328","tt0065421",3842,2,"'The AristoCats 1970,' directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, was the twentieth film in Disney's official canon, and is a romantic musical comedy revolving around a family of aristocratic cats living in Paris, France in 1910.",-4

"3332","tt0065421",3842,6,"Animation wise, 'The AristoCats' isn't anything particularly notable, with much earlier Disney films such as 'Snow White ' and 'Fantasia 1940,' demonstrating a similar, or even superior, visual style.",2
"3333","tt0065421",3842,7,"However, the story is interesting and exciting  particularly for younger audiences, I'll wager  and the musical numbers which I wish were more numerous are terrific.",5
"3334","tt0065421",3842,8,"For the sake of trivia, I'll name my two favourite songs as ""Thomas O'Malley Cat"" and ""Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat,"" the latter of which is a psychedelic throwback to the late 60s, with a swinging jazz band and delirious flashing colours, led by a trendy feline called the Scat Cat Scatman Crothers.",2
"3335","tt0065421",3842,9,"The family's journey back to Paris is eventful and adventurous, and we meet such friendly characters as Amelia and Abigail Gabble two talkative geese, Uncle Waldo the pair's drunken relative, Georges Hautecourt Madam Bonfamille's ancient but sprightly lawyer and Napoleon and Lafayette two dim witted hound dogs with a hunger for the butler's rump.",0

"3371","tt0065421",3844,7,"Their scenes with Edgar, and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his cool dude band, are classic.",-8
"3372","tt0065421",3844,8,"Most striking about seeing The Aristocats now is how deeply Disney's style of animation has changed since this was at the cutting edge in 1970.",0
"3373","tt0065421",3844,9,"Perhaps the nostalgic, dated feel are just a result of being plonked down in Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are fussier a pity and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic sometimes a relief than in more recent efforts such as Aladdin.",-3

"3382","tt0065421",3845,9,"The score is great and like in ""the Jungle Book"" you have scenes that is almost ""musical"" in the sense that the story doesn't progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves via dance.",9

"8567","tt0103776",7989,7,"I feel this way about Pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the Cat Woman she starts off as the rather pathetic mousy Selena Kyle and then truly dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then I suppose back to a hero in the end.",4

"8576","tt0103776",7989,16,"Gotham City never looked as good as it does on Blu Ray and HD so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of Batman Returns.",7
"8577","tt0103776",7989,17,"So all in I truly feel that of all the Batman movies Batman Returns believe it or not tops the Dark Knight for me because while I enjoyed that movie for Heath Ledger's amazing performance as the Joker I felt that the movie was lacking something.",7

"8588","tt0103776",7990,10,"Again Batman an aptly brooding Michael Keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit look at the eyes plays second fiddle to the bad guys, but I always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique, but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed.",1
"8589","tt0103776",7990,11,"And his turn of Bruce Wayne was well served too.",0
"8590","tt0103776",7990,12,"Burton's illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his sleek Gothic style engraving an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes.",0
